This product seemed thinner that normal to me.  So I went to an Ulta (certified distributor for Deva Curl) and bought the same product, and it is way, way thicker.  The squirt of the product I bought at Ulta retained it's shape as squirted and the Amazon product puddled.  We could tell the difference when rubbing it between our fingers.  There was 4 of us.  We all agreed, the Amazon product is watered down!  Don't buy this!  I will never buy a Deva product from Amazon will again.

Fake product. Anyone who has tried the real thing would know by the first whiff. This does not smell anything like the real conditioner and it doesn’t work like it either. My hair clumped together in one big ball and wouldn’t untangle. I returned it. Stay away from caben. This seller isn’t selling authentic devacurl!

This is not the legit product. I have been using Deva Curl One Condition for years and this bottle's contents both smelled different and had a thicker consistency than the real stuff. This stuff has a consistency that of a thick body butter, not of Deva Curl One Condition conditioner. It's so thick that you need to use twice as much and rub it around in your hands to even get it to spread into your hair. It's awful. I also know it's not right because my hair isn't conditioned at all once I rinse it out. And you have to rinse it FOREVER to get it all out or it will leave a residue leaving your hair crunchy and gross. Find out who's providing you this product, Amazon, and take them to task. They are selling you fake One Condition.

I am a huge fan of DevaCurl products. I have been using DevaCurl for over a year now. It works well for both my long hair and short hair.I started with their travel size of the ""DevaCurl Kit for All Curl Kind"" It includes 3oz bottles of  No-Poo Original, One Condition Original, Styling Cream, Light Defining Gel.I was really shocked at how well this line of products worked on my hair. I buy all of them in the large bottles now. Individually they are good products but together they have changed my curls. I am not kidding at all! My curls are curlier, not crunch, not as frizzy and overall more beautiful than before I used DevaCurl.

I want to start by saying I'm a big fan of this conditioner. I love, love the results I've gotten from it & how soft it's made my hair. I have to agree with other posts that ""THIS"" bottle of conditioner is a little thinner. I compared the old bottle with this & there is definitely a difference. I notice I'm having to use more conditioner now & my hair isn't as soft. It does seem watered down. I would not buy this product from this seller again just because of this, but I would def buy this conditioner again. I will go back to the first seller. I was looking for a cheaper price & I guess you get what you pay for.

Just received this conditioner and it's the daily creme conditioner, not the ultra creamy that is in the photo.  It's still good conditioner but the ultra creamy is much thicker and coats better.  It's possible that Deva does not offer the ultra creamy version anymore since it's getting more difficult to find, but then the new bottle should also be shown in the photo.

This product seems like it was tampered with and laundry detergent was added to it. It smells like it too. It is so liquidy and doesn't feel like conditioner. After the first time, it appeared to have stripped my hair color. I gave it another try and it is a failure. I am so disappointed and do not recommend this product.

I am a mixed race female with somewhat loose curls. I would say this is a ""decent"" hair product but you could do much better for half the price. I've tried Paul Mitchell, biolage, mixed chicks, redkin, and various other ""pricey"" brands. Deva curl definitely ranks 2nd or 3rd. Cantu and other ""natural"" hair products definitely work better for half the price ! Save your money and shop elsewhere ! Or invest in some Moroccan oil (that stuff is worth the money in my opinion) !

Let’s be honest, devacurl is expensive. Like everyone else on here I was weary of purchasing through amazon because of the warnings in the reviews. So I’ll just keep it real for the first time devacurl users and the long time ones, it’s a little lengthy but I hope it helps:1. For the long time users, keep in mind some of these reviewers are deva certified and get paid to sell devacurl products. I wouldn’t be surprised if half of these “DO NOT BUY. MADE ME HAIR HORRIBLE. KNOCK OFF” reviewers are just upset they’re losing sales. I’ve purchased the styling cream for $14 on here (which is what it SHOULD cost) and I honestly don’t have many complaints. The smell was great. However I DID notice 2 things about this conditioner. The product packaging looked like it slightly spilled which means it could’ve possibly been tampered with. And the product consistency was a little more watered down than original (I compared it with a 3oz $10 devacurl cream conditioner I purchased from ulta on my hand). I also let it sit on my hand, the one from ulta was thicker and took longer to dry than the one I purchased on here.  Probably explains why when I parted my hair on wash day, the side I used the amazon conditioner left my hair slightly dryer than the side I where used the conditioner from ulta. So I do agree that this is not 100%authentic. Still, it did not harm my hair and did leave it smelling great overall which is what I honestly use it for. You’re just getting what you pay for I guess.2. For the first time devacurl users, as mentioned, I honestly only use devacurl for special occasions for the SMELL. This product is way to overpriced and rips off natural haired girls. I use it sparingly when I am heading out. There’s much better options for much more reasonable prices if you want quality care. And I am all about quality, but high prices doesn’t always mean good quality it’s just name brand you’re buying. And that’s what devacurl is, name brand. Not bad but not the best for your money’s worth. Quality products would be Mielle Organics (my favorite), Nutrahair Cachos (got it from a Brazilian friend and LOVED it), Naturallclub deep conditioner (my friend swears by it) even the DIY. There’s also Curlmix and bellebar that gets great reviews.The take away? I have low porosity 4a (some 3c) curls. My hair actually prefers watered down products even though it’s thicker/tighter curled, which is why I use original conditioner from devacurl. However this particular product? Too watered down I prefer the real conditioner. Again, I’ve purchased the styling cream with no problem from amazon for almost half the price and had no problems, packaging was even perfect, just not this conditioner. Do not let some of these devacurl stylist deter you away from saving you some $$ on amazon. They get paid off of this stuff. Obviously it works for some other purchasers so it’s not THAT bad. Personally it left my hair a little dryer due to whatever they added which I don’t trust it and probably not worth buying even at $14 anyway. Just because this was my experience doesn’t mean it won’t be the same for you. I’m just sticking to regular sulfate free shampoos and conditioners, it’s honestly what you LEAVE IN your hair or DEEP CONDITION with that actually matters!!! Devacurl as a whole company wouldn’t get more than 3 stars from me, they’re lucky it smells great. I did not like the packaging which is why I’m giving it 2 stars. I’ll probably only use and purchase the styling cream from devacurl from now on.Hope this helps!!!

This isn't the real product. I've been using Deva for years and when I first recieved this, the smell wasn't right - it smelled like cheap hand lotion. It didn't feel right on my hair either, the consistency. I continued using it, and my curls started drying out and falling flat, my hair was breaking, etc. So I took the bottle in to a Sephora to compare the scent and consistency with an in-store product, and they WERE NOT THE SAME. I'd recommend buying straight from a salon or the like before you totally destroy your curls.

I got lucky! After reading the reviews I was really worried about getting a knock off.  As soon as I received it, I opened it to make sure that it had a thick creamy texture and a light lemon scent and it does! So it’s got to be the real thing. I have used this 4 days in a row now, and I really like it! I have really long thick hair, mostly wavy but sometimes curly.  So far I have noticed that my hair feels softer, and less frizzy which is really what I wanted to go for. As for volume, since my hair already has natural volume I haven’t really noticed a difference with that.  I can’t wait to receive the “shampoo” part of this. So far I just been using this conditioner.

This is by far the best curly hair product line I have ever used.  Years ago I used a L'Oréal line.  Then I used an Aveda line.A friend suggested deva curl.  She said it would be life changing and she was so right.  My hair has never looked better!  My daughter uses it too and it is amazing how much better her hair looks and feels.  I wish I would have known about deva when she was little because it is an amazing detangler.Take 3 minutes to watch a you tube video on how to use the products!  With simple techniques shown in the videos, you can learn to wash your hair and  let it air dry and have a great hair day!

DO NOT BUY. Fake product. I’ve bought Devacurl before from amazon as a set shampoo and conditioner, it was legit. I needed to re-up and got this. This is ABSOLUTELY another product with DC packaging.On arrival the pump head had been sprung already, bad sign #1. The conditioner is shiny and much more watery than the real deal. It smells like suave. I thought okay maybe they changed something, trying to not be suspicious because this is sold from Devacurl directly- or that’s how it seems. I rinsed and got out of the shower, I had to re-rinse because my hair was full of suds still. The true product DOES NOT LATHER THERE SHOULDN'T BE SUDS. Currently less than 10 minutes after a shower and my scalp is on fire. RUN from this product. Don’t test your luck, don’t be me and not check the reviews.

I have been using Deva Curl products since 2006 with great results. Low-Poo, No-Poo and One Condition have been my go to. The company has been sold 3 times since then and apparently has added some toxic chemistry to their products. In the last several years, I have noticed severe hair loss at my scalp and my hairline. My hair used to be so thick that hairdressers joked that they'd have to sharpen their scissors after my haircut. My hair is now so thin, I can see my head and my curls don't last beyond the first day and turn into fuzz and frizz where there used to be curls. My hair used to be healthy and grew fast. I haven't had a haircut in 3 years and my hair does not seem to be growing. My diet is excellent and I feel fine. This product sucks and has damaged my hair and a whole community of former DevaCurl users. There are a few Facebook groups with horrible stories of what's happening to them because of DevaCurl's products. One group has over 11,000 members

I learned of this product by going to a Devacurl hair specialist. The specialist taught me what products to use and how to use them properly on my hair. I have to say it is a process but well worth it. Since I've used this product, my hair has come back to life. I always get compliments for my hair and that it smells so good! Love it! You need to know what your curl type is whether you have wavy, curly or super curly hair. This product runs by three different types of curls which are, wavy (light green bottle lid), curly (green bottle lid) and super curly (teal bottle lid). My curl type is curly so I purchased the (Green bottle lid).Process: While in the shower I used my No-Poo(Green bottle lid) and massaged my scalp and crunched it at the same time. When rinsing my hair I allow the No-Poo run down to the tip of my hair until you rinse completely. I then use the Devacurl Conditioner (which I was delivered the wrong bottle, Teal bottle lid for super curly but I didn't bother to return it because I really needed a conditioner for my hair which is why I gave it the 4 stars) and massaged the scalp. As I began to rinse my hair I allowed the conditioner run down to the tip of my hair and began to run my fingers through my hair for any tangles. (You can use a wide-tooth brush for the stubborn tangles but only while you are in the shower with conditioner on your hair!) You can leave some conditioner on your hair when your rinsing. When done with rinsing, lean your hair over, begin to use the Devacurl gel and begin to crunch your hair. Then get a microfiber towel and continue to crunch the hair. (I recommended you to NOT wrap the towel on your hair to dry!!) It's best to crunch as it stops dripping wet.  As you use the towel your hair begins to dry. Please use a MICROFIBER TOWEL!! It helps with frizz control. I purchased one on amazon and it's amazing! I then used curl clips (Bought from Amazon) while my hair air dries and get myself  ready to allow some volume when I get ready to defuse my hair. When I'm ready to defuse my hair I first remove the hair clips and use the Devacurl defuser which I love!. Totally recommend and begin to defuse your hair. After getting used to the process it will get easier for you.  I still want to try more products from Devacurl and when I do I will let you know my results. When this package was delivered it was also spilling. However, delivery like always was fast. Hopefully next time I get the right bottle for my hair type but so far so good!!

Unfortunately, I've been hit with my first fake bottle in over 10 years... I bought it months ago so I can't return it... Beware of Pharmapacks!

This bottle of Deva Curl One Conditioner is not authentic. I have used this conditioner for years and I have a bottle that I bought at the salon to compare it with. It smells and feels differently than the original.It smells like the no poo not the conditioner.I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with this product and would not buy it again from this seller.

I have baby fine curly hair and this stuff is too heavy for me, and just makes my hair greasy.My sister has thick curly hair and swears by this stuff. She lets her hair air dry and it always looks like she just came from the salon. A little goes a long way and you'd only need a pump, maybe 2 to get the job done so this is lasting her well over 2 months  (which is when she would usually be running out)
"
"
This stuff is amazing for my hair. Like people can actually tell when I am not using devacurl because of how bad and frizzy my hair gets with other products. I use the no poor cleanser, the conditioner, styling cream and the foam. It works wonders on my hair!The first picture was with me using 'curly hair' products there was some curl to it but some areas just didnt want to curl and did not leave my hair moisturized. The second picture is after a few days of washing it the color shines and it looks so healthy. I absolutely love this stuff. And will always budget out money for it because it works!

I know a lot of people who are dedicated to Deva Curl so I wanted to give the line a try. I'm not sure if this product is counterfeit, but it did not do for me what I thought it would. It felt nice going in my hair in the shower, but the smell was very strong and very synthetic-smelling. I do think it might have supported and enhanced my waves, but after 2 uses my scalp was unbearably itchy all day.  I bought a new shower filter because I thought the minerals in my water were to blame, but when I experimented with the Deva again my scalp was again itchy. I can't use this product. I'm not sure if it is counterfeit or because my hair doesn't agree with Deva. I know that there are rumors and claims around that Deva changed their formula and it's causing people to lose their hair, and I kind of believe it. Also, it didn't even particularly make my hair feel very soft and hydrated. I've used tons of different product, and this one was a dud.
"
"
I had used the devacurl line before when I wasn’t too interested in getting my natural curls back - i just wanted some good products that could manage my heat damaged curls during my tropical vacation. I wasn’t too fond of the smell either. Now that I’m a “curly girl”, I absolutely love the smell of this product. And now that I’ve learned how I should apply products to my coarse, thin hair, I love the product even more. Application is not and should not be the same for everyone. It makes a huge difference on how the product will perform. And now that I know how to apply this product to my hair, I think it performs fantastically. I love this product now and it will become part of my regulars.

This. Stuff. Does. Nothing. I am so disappointed. After watching countless YouTube videos and reading reviews of everyone raving about this product I really wanted to try it but put off doing so because of the price. After years, I finally decided to treat myself and make the purchase. The scent is so strong and overpowering. When it’s air drying I get whiffs of it every time a turn my head and then all I can think about is how strong it smells. This is never usually an issue with products for me. Secondly, it does absolutely nothing. I really thought this stuff we be my holy grail. Where is all of that moisture everyone raved about? The slip? It’s the only product in my hair right now and feels greasy. It’s as if it won’t absorb. I know this conditioner doesn’t contain silicones but it feels like it IS a silicone. I didn’t want to believe the negative reviews because I seen so many positives. Maybe they weren’t using it correctly. Maybe they are false reviews fabricated by competitors. But, I’ve used it multiple times by now and it hasn’t failed to disappoint. It’s worth a try so that you can see for yourself. Apparently people have different results, but don’t get your hopes up too high.

I first encountered this DevaCurl One Condition conditioner at Target. I fell in love with it after the first try. I felt like it hydrated my strands all the way to the inner layers of my hair, which then prevented my hair from frizzing. If you have dry, curly, or wavy hair, a moisturizing conditioner is what you will need to eliminate frizz. Not only did this conditioner get rid of the frizz,  it made my hair manageable too. I'm used to spending lots of time detangling my hair and this conditioner totally saved me the extra step. And the best part is I always had a nice hair day after using this. After I ran out, I naturally wanted to buy another bottle. Unfortunately, Target no longer sold it, so Amazon was the next best option. HUGE MISTAKE. The thing about Amazon is they sell everything. But another thing about Amazon is they don't vet their vendors. I believe I bought a heavily diluted DevaCurl One Condition conditioner from a vendor on Amazon. How do I know? The conditioner I bought from Amazon felt like water. It wasn't thick like the one I had previously used and it took me many, many pumps just to coat my hair. And worst of all, it did not give my hair the same great results as previously described. The seller I bought from is PHARMAPACKS. Just make a purchase at your own discretion if you choose Amazon. Otherwise, just buy straight from the company that makes it. There's no point in saving a few extra bucks with a sketchy seller when you don't even get the same great results.

This is not the original product. For years of using the actual original (while cap, old green label like in the photo) - I loved it and everything was great. Now, they advertise as ""original"" but ship the new version (green cap, mostly white label), and it gives me a reaction in the shower every time. And I can't even return it because the bottle busted in shipping. Very disappointed, DevaCurl, disappointed and saddened.
"

I've used this product for years. I used to have dry curly hair but with continued use of this product, it's not dry anymore. I wash my hair 2x week with the no-poo and use this in the shower every day. I buy it in the 32 oz container because it's so much cheaper.Now, on to Amazon. I ordered the 32 oz and received the 12 oz. I contacted Amazon to tell them of the mistake and I was told they were out of stock of the 32 oz. So, first of all, the site doesn't say they are out of stock. They then took my money and sent me a smaller size without notifying me that they were out of stock. Did Amazon think I wouldn't notice the difference in size - and price??? I'm disappointed in Amazon.

My hair is wavy/curly, thin, dry, frizzy. I used Pantene shampoo and conditioner until I stumbled upon a “miracle” DevaCurl no poo cleanser and One conditioner. I was hoping to get rid of frizz and make my hair healthier. I’ve been using DevaCurl no poo and their one conditioner for about 3 weeks now, twice a week. My hair seems to be even drier and frizzier then ever before. I also noticed it gets tangled very easily and is very coarse to touch.  It is a mess, I am going back to regular shampoo and conditioner.

The only brand I trust with my crazy curly hair! Before using DevaCurl my hair was dry, frizzy and life less! Now my hair has nice soft bouncy curls. My one trick is after I slightly towel dry my hair, I add conditioner to my ends (not touching the roots) and leave it in. Then I scrunch up hair with a paper towel or two. I never use a hair dryer or a brush! I just take the conditioner in my hands and using my fingers as a brush, I run it through my hair. Also my hair is now past my shoulders and I could never let it pass my shoulders in the past because I would always get nots near my neck in the back of my head. I have been using DevaCurl for about 2 years now. I highly recommend this product for those who struggle with curly hair or wavy hair!

Seems as though there are mixed reviews regarding this Deva Curl Conditioner... you either love it or wish that you spent your money elsewhere. I’m in the love it category. I gravitate towards lighter hair products because I do not have extremely textured, treated, or damaged hair. This conditioner is light, curl defining, and easy to ‘squish’ deep into the shaft (some conditioners don’t seem to want to sink in).The only thing that I would change is the scent. It’s not a foul or offensive smell, but I don’t find it to be particularly feminine or alluring. But maybe it’s not supposed to be.That said, I want it as part of my arsenal.

--If this review helped you, please click ""helpful""--Deva Curl has yet to disappoint me! I have so many of the after-shower products but just recently purchased this. I love it! It really makes a difference (which I didn't think it would) in my curls on wash day. My wash days are so much better than they used to be. I used to dread them and plan my life accordingly but I don't have to do that with this shampoo and conditioner. I do follow with all DC products and my curls love it! They're looking better than ever!--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--

I keep coming back to this to maintain my fine 3b/c natural curls.  Strangely enough I can also use this on my daughter who has straight fine hair and it makes her hair look great as well.  I love the smell, how it doesn't cause heavy build up and I couple this with the Deva Curl ultra defining gel and giovanni direct leave in conditioner which I apply before the gel.  I use a wet brush or Denman brush to gently comb the product through my hair, then shake while holding the ends and lightly scrunch my curls to form them.  It's a great routine for me.
"
"
I ordered this product that I’ve been using for years and am 99.99% certain they cut the product with something else. It smelled different and had a thinner consistency. I got a terrible rash on my scalp from this. I use One Condition religiously and have never had this reaction. I won’t prefer from this vendor ever again

I am an older woman with long, still healthy, thick hair. My hair dresser recommended these products to me several years ago, and I have used nothing else since. It doesn't strip your hair like most shampoos, and the conditioner can be left in if desired. You can ""scrunch"" your wet hair with this product and the curls stay until next shampoo. I love the fragrance, also!

This my favorite conditioner.  I use it not only to condition my hair after washing it, but also use it to style my hair.  It detangles well, and it doesn't flake when used with other products.  I wash with Deva No-Poo and i get wonderful results from both.  They leave my hair soft and manageable.
"
"
I was fed up with my normal products still allowing my curls to get frizzy, so I finally tried this No Poo products. I wish I had switched YEARS ago. I have fine, thick Caucasian curls and it doesn't weigh my hair down or make it greasy like a lot of curl products can since they tend to be really heavy products. I use the No Poo cleanser, conditioner and coconut hair cream and my hair is FANTASTIC, especially on the second or third day. When needed, I wash with an dandruff shampoo but otherwise I stick to this and will always do so.

Here's a pic of the leaky/damaged pump I received today.  The conditioner was all over the bubble wrap, too.  And now I can't get the pump to work.  I REALLY want the pump to work.  I'd return/exchange it, but I really need it.  I love the product and have used nothing else for months.  What I really want is a new pump, but I can't figure out how to contact the seller, so I'm posting it here.  Of course, getting a new pump or not will play into how I purchases this product next time.
"
"
Okay so I was nervous about this cause I read that some people ended up with watered down or knockoff products when they ordered this. My seller was Truemark, and the product that I received appears to be an authentic. The bottle is right and the texture is right, not watery and not too thick. The ingredient list matches the current ingredient list that’s on the official DevaCurl website. See photos if you wanna compare yourself! Point is, this seller is a good one. Make sure to check the seller when buying it!
"
"
I was sent a fake product! The product was sent from Amazon Services LLC and it is not Deva Curl conditioner. I have an almost empty bottle of the real stuff in my shower and when I opened this new bottle It was so evident that it was fake. It smelled nothing like the original. It smelled like lemon pledge and did not moisturize at all. It was hotel conditioner quality garbage and I’m super disappointed. I’m definitely sending it back for a refund
"
"
I used to use this and loved it. Unfortunately, smelled like I was giving myself a perm just now. (My hairdressers continually say it’s natural.) So I checked the ingredients and Behentrimonium Chloride? Come on, Devacurl. Step up your ingredients. And that isn’t the only one. Not using this on a semi regular basis. Not healthy.However, if you don’t care about something being healthy and do care very much about your hair style.... this product gives you beautiful, luscious, piecy curls.
"
"
Arrived like this...box was not damaged, the lid was open and it poured out. what’s MOST concerning is there is no label on the bottle AT ALL.Skitchyyyyyyy if you ask me.
"
"
I’ve used this product for three years. When it seemed my hair was thinning, I stopped using it, unsure of the cause. After a year off Deva products my hair started thickening up again. Like a fool, I went back to using Deva products. Now, six months later, my hair is falling out in large clumps. I am sick about it and think these products should be off the market!
"
"
This is my all time favorite conditioner but I'm getting tired of receiving bottles with leaky tops. How hard is it to tape them closed for shipping?
"
"
I’ve used Deva Curl One Condition for years. I noticed a few months ago that the bottle I purchased had a very strong smell, but thought it was just me. It was also thinner. I got through the bottle and didn’t think much about it. I haven’t noticed any differences from the real thing with the last couple bottles, but after watching the Broken (Netflix docu-series) episode on counterfeit cosmetics... I’m genuinely concerned. I was under the misconception that buying from the “Amazon Recommended” vendor guaranteed legitimacy. I will only be buying from stores that I trust and will NEVER buy any cosmetic on Amazon again. I say that as an environmental engineer, who is knowledgeable about exposure to toxins and carcinogens.
"
"
This is the most expensive personal care system I have ever purchased!I used Deva Curl Low Poo, One Conditioner and the Ultra Defining Gel in my morning shower.  During the day I started to feel itchy.Three hours before my flight the following morning I got out of bed to find my face swollen and blaze red.  I had a rash from head to toe!Allergic Contact Dermatitis!  WooHoo.  Lucky me!!!  NO this has NEVER happened to me before.To avoid a possible medical emergency on my 7 hour flight it was determined that my vacation should be cancelled - airfare, rental car, hotels etc.Instead of jetting off to vacation land I spent my morning in the ER to be a grateful recipient of a steroid shot.The week of vacation time was spent alternately trying to scratch off the top layer of skin and slathering on lotion to combat the itch.I think I can safely say that this product will never enter my home again.
"
"
Nothing works better for my 3B curly hair.  I find it works best when hair is completely saturated with water, really water-logged, before applying.  Then I seal it with the DevaCurl Ultra Defining gel.  For a pickup later, I have a spray bottle of water with some of the OneCondition Decadence in it; a quick shake and spray redfines curls and tames frizz. But if it's your first time trying to ""get your curl on,"" get yourself to a Deva-certified stylist to get a cut and tutorial on how to use this stuff.  It will change your relationship with your curls!
"
"
I was apprehensive to buy this conditioner; it's a lot more than I usually pay and I didn't think conditioner could make much of a difference. Boy was I wrong! Not only does it make my hair look better and feel healthier, but I also don't use nearly as much as I do when I was using cheaper conditioner. It only takes two pumps to fully condition my hair, and because of that, I think it might even be cheaper than using a lower quality conditioner to get similar results.
"
"
I love the product but the distributor needed to tighten the lid and ensure it wouldn't loosen in transit. The conditioner did come in a sealed plastic bag, but the lid was quite loose and a couple ounces of the product leaked into the bag. I couldn't salvage what spilled and was sad to lose the conditioner. (This is pricey stuff that I didn't want to waste.) When I removed the bottle from the bag, I was surprised by how loose the lid was. I've received similar products intact because the distributor tightened and taped the lid into place.
"
"
Normally this product gets a 5 star but because it came damaged in the package I gave it a 4 star.  I just wish the supplier would have shipped a replacement at no charge, and they even made me return the damaged one.  Normally they tell you to just throw it away.  Super product for frizzy curly hair.  Love it and have been using it for years.
"
"
I cant say enough, i am in LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT!!! My curls came back, ive been hearing about this product, but hesitated due to the costs.  But took a chance, and nowwwww, I will never ever use any other product! If you have thick curls like me (Puerto Rican thick curls), this is your product. Ehhhh I am not to crazy about the smell but it goes away after awhile.
"
"
It is not the same as I used before.  I suspect it is authentic.  I used this more conditioner than I did before.  My hair is not as curly as it used to be.  It gets more frizzle.  I used the other containers for traveling. There are conditioner, No Poo, etc in the package.  They made my hair shinier, curlier, and cleaner than this I just bought.
"
"
I love this conditioner and I leave it in to keep my curls soft and moisturized.  I LIVE the fresh scent too!  I add it to my washed hair, keeping it super wet.  I use 4-5 pumps on my hand and use my fingers to comb out any tangles and then add more, another 4-5 pumps and scrunch up my curls, while still in the shower.  My hair is still very wet but water helps your curls!  I wrap my hair loosely in a towel, squeeze my ends with the towel and then continue to squeeze my curls with just my hands.  I have long hair, just past my bra line.  I use a little mousse to keep away the frizz and my curls look awesome!
"
"
I don't feel this product is worth the price. My hair is dull after using this and it does not enhance the curl. The newer lemongrass scent is better than this original scent. Overall not impressed with this product, especially for the price. I like to buy cruelty free, vegan products but won't be using this one.
"
"
I have tried oh so many shampoo and conditioner combinations for my curly hair and most either frizz it out because there is not enough moisture or weigh down the curls because they leave a residue. I have found that this does neither and is a great conditioner for curly hair. I use it every other day and it keeps my curls moisturized. It has a very light and pleasant smell and does not leave a residue to weigh down your curls. I have noticed that my curls are much more natural looking since using this conditioner. I use it with the Deva Curl shampoo which is a low sudsing shampoo. They do work very well together. I feel this is well worth the money.
"
"
I’ve used DevaCurl products for a few years now and won’t use anything else. I know they say you have to buy it in a salon for it to be the real deal, but I haven’t had any problems at all. I buy online when I can’t find it in large bottles at my local DevaCurl salon and this appears to be an identical product.
"
"
I started using this product when I started doing the curly girl method.  I've tried a few other conditioners since, but keep coming back to the Deva One-C because of the slip.  I like how it makes my hair feel super smooth.  It is a little on the thin side, however. It never seems to coat my ends well enough.  I'm still searching for the ""perfect"" conditioner. For me and my 3B hair, that would be something super thick, super moisturizing, a little protein, and a LOT of slip. I do a lot of finger combing in the shower, so I like a product that will reduce friction as much as possible.  Since giving up silicones, I've not found anything that fits the bill perfectly (I used Infusium-23 before the curly girl switch, which I loved).  It's also a little pricey for how much I have to use.  It smells really nice, though.  Kind of spicey in a weird way.  So far, Deva One Condition is the best silicone-free conditioner I've found, but still not what is perfect for me.
"
"
The product did not smell right, or condition my hair. I have used this product line for many years and know what to expect. The sellers were not responsive to my complaint.
"
"
I have very fine, curly hair and most products either weigh down my hair so much it has trouble keeping its curl or dry it out so much it gets frizzy. Before DevaCurl I had the most luck with Redken Fresh Curl shampoo, conditioner and curl boost spray as well as L'Oreal Leave-In Conditioner for curls, but even that combo would dry it out a bit too much.My stylist recommended the DevaCurl product line & I am so grateful. It is very moisturizing without being heavy & even the most frizz-prone bits of my hair have spiraled into perfect curls. I tried using some DevaCurl combined with the above-mentioned other brand products I already used & that was an improvement, but once I switched to exclusively DevaCurl stuff every aspect of my hair & curls improved. No, Deva Concepts does not pay me. :)Seriously, this stuff works wonders! My curls are very happy with me now.
"
"
This conditioner was all leaked out in bag. That makes me wonder if someone tampered with it or replaced it with some other product ? I would not recommend buying it from here!
"
"
I've been using this exact same product for over ten years, and this is NOT an authentic product. The smell and consistency are different and it doesn't work the same in my hair. Do not purchase from this vendor.
"
"
So when the company said it was the same formula with new packaging... well, that's a flat-out lie. The scent is now awful (I'm allergic... this is going to be a fun day), the consistency is thinner, and there's way less glycerin. I have an old bottle and the ingredient list has completely changed. Great. This was the only thing I've found that made my curls look decent. I even checked to see if maybe one of the other two new formulas was closer to the old formula, no dice.
"
"
DevaCurl is easily the BEST line of hair products I have ever purchased in my adult life.  I have ethnically-mixed curly hair of multiple colors, curls and textures.  I've been through Redken, Mixed Chicks, Miss Jessie's, BioSilk, MoroccanOil, Pantene, Motions, and who knows what else, but I honestly don't think I've ever been happier.Even after the first wash, my curls had more structure, bounce and vitality, and the ends are no longer brittle and dry.  My goodness, there was even SHINE.  I have less frizz and my head no longer smells like a salon.I used this conditioner in combination with the Heaven in Hair Moisture treatment and the No-Poo Shampoo for my current results.
"
"
I’m sure the product is as expected but the packaging?! Surely lost several ounces of expensive product already without even opening it. Apparently it was too much trouble to tape the top down so it wouldn’t halfway screw off during shipping. Nothing to hold it down either. Bottle just rolled around within it’s plastic bag in the box.
"
"
Very bad for black hair. As soon as it touched my hair, it became so tangled up. I tried to untangle with my fingers, my hair broke in so many small pieces. Do not recommend for African American hair
"
"
Disappointed! Although this smells just like the salon product, this is not the same consistency. It is very much a watered down version. Feel taken to the cleaners after spending $$$ through this seller. I guess I should have just bought the one at the salon. At least I would know I have gotten the original product.
"
"
Not sure what the deal is with this seller? The conditioner bottle I received must be a second from the factory because A) it had a devacurl no poo shampoo label on it, and B) although it was conditioner inside, it was NOT the original devacurl scented conditioner.  Honestly not sure which conditioner it was? It has a minty/rose smell.  It does work like devacurl conditioner though so I did keep it.
"
"
I love this conditioner! It has excellent slip and is still lightweight. I have 2c/3a hair, I don't like anything that weighs it down but I also need a lot of moisture and hydration. This conditioner is the perfect balance. Seriously a holy grail curly product. Also, the large bottle lasts forever so its worth every penny.
"
"
I cannot say enough about this product! My hair has never looked as good. My curls are soft and tighter than ever before! Not to mention it lasts all day without getting frizzy, I haven't used a hair tie in weeks.I use the conditioner every day like shampoo, making sure to scrub my scalp and really work it into the ends. I then rinse, but not completely. I use the ""no-poo"" once a week. I use the gel when my hair is sopping wet and then again after it has hair dried a bit, just to make sure the ends are covered.I will never go back to another product. Nor will I ever have to waste money again for products that don't work.
"
"
Great conditioner. My ex made me buy this for her on Amazon. Her hair smelled so good and was so soft. That pretty much was only thing soft about her. The lovely smell of her hair after using this conditioner my have bought her a day or two before she got the boot.
"
"
I have short naturally curly hair.  I quite like this conditioner as it is both thin and light while providing ample conditioning.  I have not had good results using it as an after product for control, with or without the Angel Gel.  It does cause your curls to 'behave' a bit differently and for the most part I like that although I think it might work better on longer hair rather than short.  I find my curls are  more defined and as a result a bit 'heavier' so overall my hair appears flatter.  I have tried using clips as recommended to lift the curls as they dry but have not had great success in creating more volume.  Once my hair dries I have found it frizzes if you manipulate your hair at all.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl conditioner on ny kids hair for a little over a year.  From the salon and from amazon.  My recent order was not the same as the salon.  I can barely take the over fragrance without getting a headache and it doesn't appear to have the same results on ny girls beautiful curls.  Beware ordering.  You never know if you are getting the real item or some over fragranced knock off.
"
"
I have really long, really curly hair and i've always had a problem finding a product that worked well with my hair type. Either it was too light and my hair would be frizzy all day, or it would be too heavy and would weigh my hair down making it look greasy. I think i finally found one in the middle :)the devacurl works really well holding my curls all day, i use it as a conditioner but also leave a little in and let it air dry. finally a good hair day! And it smells really nice too. i would highly recommend the DevaCurl Conditioner for women with thick curly hair and its not pricy either. i gave it four stars because it does seem a little watered down therefore i have to use a lot of it so im probably gonna run out soon. but i'll definitely be buying this again. and again.
"
"
I've been using Deva Curl One Condition for a little over 2 years now. I love the stuff. Its a bit pricey, but a bottle this size can last me about 4-6 months (but I have fine hair thats just past my shoulders, so I don't need to use a lot at a time) If you're new to the Deva Curl method of conditioner-washing your hair it may take some getting used to, but once you get it right, you'll love it. And your hair will love it.The scent isn't strong or overpowering at all, which I really like. And its not really thick and goopy, so it rinces out of your hair cleanly. I love this stuff. I've tried other conditioners and always come back to Deva. And I like that its up to $8 cheaper on Amazon!
"
"
if you have curly hair, embrace it. i have tried probably hundreds of products marketed for curly hair over the years with no great results. until i found deva concepts. this product and the whole curly girl system is a great way to learn to love your curls and let them be free. i use this stuff every single day, i use it to wash/scrub my scalp with one a week or so, and on the other days i just use it to hydrate in the shower. also, the tiniest bit can be left in soaking wet hair for great results once dry. i will never need another conditioner as long as i live!btw, i pair this with the new deva volumizing foam for perfect curls every day :)
"
"
i have been working with different hair products for years this has been a life savor. It makes my hair light and curls are coiling beautifully and it holds being in high humidity in Kentucky. I love everything about it and will buy it forever and i love telling other people with my hair to use it.
"
"
Question it’s authenticity if you don’t get it from your salon!  It did not smell the same as my salon purchased product - had a chemical reaction to my colored hair causing it to dry and shrivel.
"
"
The Deva conditioner is great to use but it doesn’t have the slip for leave in. I wash my hair with this, I feel for my hair that there is too much protein. My curls are a 3A/B and very dry at the ends. I leave it in my hair so the squish and put it up in a tee shirt to dry until 80% dry.
"
"
If you have curly hair this will change your life.  Use it every day and your curls will blow your mind with their perfection.  If you are near their salon in NYC get an appt.  Changed my hair completely.  Went from buzz cut to hide the curls to perfect curly hair.
"
"
I adore the DevaCurl products and how they have transformed my hair. It feels soft and I can put my hands through it without it being all sticky like throughout the rest of my lifetime when I was using regular kinds of shampoo and conditioner. The only thing about these products, is you really have to commit to using them in order to see the change. Watch the videos and read about them and see if you want to try it out. The first time I tried the product line, my hair felt gross and I switched back to my old stuff within a couple days. But the problem is that your hair needs that time to get used to not having the dimethicone coatings and re-learn how to absorb hydration. So, I think that Deva recommends using a clarifying shampoo before you begin. I recommend this. Or just be very very patient and stick with it!After I had originally quit, I went back to it and stuck with it, and now have been devoted to Deva products for almost one year. My curls fair much better now in humidity, and overall my hair looks and feels so much healthier.The OneCondition is a must have, and it smells so lovely, a soft lemon scent, which makes me think of Frozen Italian Icees I used to have in the summer as a kid :)
"
"
I have used Deva Curl products for some time and tried the newer Delight conditioner but it was too lightweight and rinsed out too fast so it was hard to detangle my hair and I felt there was none left for the benefits of a leave-in conditioner.  I like this product MUCH better and will definitely buy it again.  Makes my hair soft and brings out my curls.
"
"
Didnt like this as well as other products. It weighed my hair down. I do highly recommend the gel from this brand...that smells awesome and holds your curls all day without being crunchy feeling.
"
"
BUYER BEWARE - COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT!!  I am a long time Deva Curl user and promoter.  I have now sent back two bottles of one conditioner and one bottle of light defining gel as the products did not smell, feel, or produce the same results as Deva Curl normally does.  Therefore, this leads me to believe that these are counterfeit products being sold on Amazon.  I will no longer purchase from Amazon but instead purchase from my salon or nearby Ulta. A real bummer!!
"
"
I once used WEN and now I know what I was doing wrong...that stuff wasn't for curly wavy frizzy hair..and overly priced...now I am using a good product that doesnt break my wallet and lasts and lasts.  I use the entire line of products...low poo..no poo and no fade creamy conditioner.  I color my wavy hair..I am 43 and have grays.  This stuff actually makes sure that I retain the color I get at the salon and that my curls are well hydrated..I use a little on my wet hair to detangle with my fingers.  then I use ANgel while wet afterwards..I wash my hair three times a week and have an easy regime in rewetting and reconditoning between washes.  Im in love with this product and have passed on the word to many of my friends.
"
"
This product line is the only one I have ever used that actually works. My hair is curly ALL THE TIME. On a rare occasion I will have what I refer to as a ""halo of fuzz."" I use it on my hair after I wash it and then I put some on the ends just before I use the styling cream.
"
"
I think this product might be a fake or altered. While the smell is good and seems correct, the texture is completely wrong. The real product has a smoothness that this doesn't. When I rub it between my fingers, it dissipates very quickly. Will NOT order again!
"
"
Had my hopes up this was going to be a great product from the reviews. Was a little disappointed in the product. Great delivery, fast shipping, but that's about where the excitement ended. I have very curly, frizzy dry hair, not helped by coloring and bleaching. Have used this for about a week to give it a fair try, but haven't had good results. Hair is still very dry, curls aren't soft. Honestly going back to Pantene pro v because it works better on my curls and hydrating than this product. The smell is also a con, read reviews that it smelled nice, must be my taste but did not think it smelled good at all. Sorry to be against the grain but as a naturally curly hair person this didn't cut it. Good luck if you try but it's a pretty expensive gamble. Not recommended for dry frizzy curls.
"
"
This is the only thing I will use in my highlighted curly hair. Works great :). I use the No Poo shampoo 2x per week and this stuff daily. I tried it as a leave-in and that was just too greasy for me (especially by the scalp) but as a traditional conditioner you can't beat it. I'm not a huge fan of the scent but it is not offensive in any way (I just think other products smell better). That's not enough to stop me from using it though.
"
"
My hair isn’t curly by any means, but it is THICK and can become very dry and brittle if not cared for properly. This conditioner is so effective and gentle i love it. Would recommend.
"
"
This is my go to rinse since I stopped using shampoo after first Deva salon styling 15ish yrs ago. Very rarely use Deva no poo or low poo. If you are looking for good conditioner to wash with.  this is great choice. Sometimes I do one ""wash"" and acsecond condition, sometimes one for all. Leave a little in on purpose or by accident and it's like a leave in. Add 1/2 water 1/2 One Condition to spray bottle and use it as a sunscreen/curl reviver.
"
"
Trying to use the curly hair method and its products and trying several different conditioners out. This one weighs down my thin and fine hair. Will not buy again but not the worst conditioner either.
"
"
As a curly girl, I have been using this wonderful product for the last 10 years.  It has changed my hair from a mass of frizz to lovely, soft, bouncy curls.  I am now frequently complimented on my hair and I always mention the Deva Curl products.  Everything they make is excellent, including this conditioner.  I can recommend it to anyone with curly hair without reservation.
"
"
I love this conditioner! It is very creamy compared to the Deva Curl One Condition. I think that this product makes my curls less frizzy when I don't add any other product after it. It doesn't feel greasy either.
"
"
I have curly hair and have recently been trying a lot of different expensive conditioners as I didn't want to continue using the cheap drug store brands.  Out of all the expensive conditioners I've tried over the past few months, I can honestly say that Devacurl has been the best.  I've actually bite the bullet and ended up purchasing the 32 oz bottle as I loved how healthy my hair looked after using this conditioner.  I've had a lot less issue with frizzies.
"
"
This was another that was ‘handed to the resident’. It wasn’t me. Already told you this. It looks like an excellent product, thanks
"
"
I've tried many shampoos/conditioners but I really like devacurl.  It makes my hair feel great.  I've been using this for years.
"
"
Love this product! I was introduced to Devacurl by my hair stylist about 3 years ago and I've been using it since. I am one of those people that constantly searches for the best products for curly hair and since I found Devacurl I've stopped.  It makes it easy to comb through your hair and it simply makes your look it's best. My whole family uses it now because it's just that good.
"
"
Not as good as I hoped. Was recommended to me, but disappointed and very expensive. I have found less expensive,  way better moisturizing conditioners through the curly girl method websites.
"
"
It took me 4 decades to figure out how to keep my hair from being dry and frizzy.  I have been using this conditioner, the gel and the shampoo for a year now and I will never switch again.  I get compliments on my curls every single day.  The only compliment I got before was ""Nice haircut"".  Now everyone wants to know how I get these curls.  I finally stopped fighting my curly hair and let it do it's own thing with little help from me.  I finally know what it is like to have moisturized hair that is pleasing to the touch.  This product also gives a beautiful shine.  Love it love it love it!
"
"
The DevaCurl line is incredible.  It's the only shampoo and conditioner I can use on my naturally curly hair that doesn't make it frizzy and too soft that it becomes puffy.  Highly recommend!!
"
"
Oh, you have dehydrated curly hair, and you've tried every product you could afford (and maybe a few you couldn't) in an effort to make your hair look healthy and happy?  Yeah, me too.  I have wavy-curly hair (type 2B for your curly girls in the know)  - and I couldn't seem to find a conditioner that was not too heavy, but actually moisturized my hair.I bought a trial package of Deva Curl at a salon, and this conditioner (and the no-poo) had me HOOKED.  I use this everyday, and I have even taken to co-washing (i.e. using conditioner to wash my scalp) with this product - and it is the best.Highly recommend it to women with my hair type - and probably type 2A/2C as well (but I'm not a professional!).

REVIEW Update Mar 2015: I'm back to say the following review is for the first bottle of One Condition I ever bought. It was creamy and rich. The SECOND bottle I purchased, from a different seller (BeautyEncounter) was watery and a big disappointment. I have read other reviews where watered-down product was mentioned as an issue and some suggest only buying directly from Deva Curl. Yes, well. It's pricey over there on the Deva Curl website!  My experience tells me that genuine product CAN be had from Amazon sellers, but it's a guessing game as to which ones. And finally, I can tell you that the real deal has a consistency similar to cold cream; it does not *pour* or *slosh around.*The Original Review:Given how a bunch of reviewers say they got watered down and/or rancid product, I had trepidation ordering One Condition for the first time this way. I feel confident though, that my Seller ""Infutech"" supplied an authentic product. I have never seen a conditioner like this; it's so thick it's like putting body lotion in your hair. My hair, which I think is ""cherub curls"" with a smattering of gray in the crown, was clearly moisture-starved and soaked it up. I skipped past any business of applying it, rinsing it out and then applying more as a leave-in - which strikes me as a very efficient way to run a lot of expensive conditioner down the drain in short order - and instead just used it as a leave-in for several weeks. What a difference! It actually looks like *human* hair now, not something you'd see on an old ratty-nest-haired doll baby. Oh, and the scent? Swoon-worthy.
"
"
I don’t think this is an authentic Deva Curl product. My hair is frizzier than ever, clumping and comes out very easily! The first bottle I purchased from a salon and lived it. This product didn’t even smell the same. I should have returned it but instead I kept using it. My poor hair.
"
"
I  love using DevaCurl One Condition Original. It leaves my hair moist and shiny and my curls manageable. I no long fight my hair. Great product for a great price.
"
"
After cleansing/conditioning, I apply four more pumps to leave in hair to dry naturally. It's amazing  at promoting controlled curl, and the FRESH SCENT just makes me happy!
"
"
Love, love, love the diva products for my naturally curly hair- if I could give 10 stars I would. The conditioner is my favorite. Leaves my hair so soft and cuts down on the frizz. The smell is terrific!
"
"
Great conditioner.  I’ve been trying to replace the Rusk product that I loved and used for years.  This is close.
"
"
This conditioner, along with the rest of the Deva Curl line works magic on my hair. Before I had a baby my hair was curly with many ringlets, springy curls etc. After baby my hair changed and I couldn't hold the curl anymore. My hair would end up straight, wavy and curly and look a mess. This product line has given me consistent curly hair with very little straight and wavy spots. Do not brush your hair between washings! You must remoisten a little in the am and twist it a little to refresh curl. Then spray the stray hair. Again do not brush, comb or pick it.
"

I highly recommend this conditioner! I use only their products on my hair. If you have curly hair, this is the product line to use. I searched for years trying to find the right products for my curls. When my hairdresser recommend these I never went back. I've been using them loyally for over 8 years now—love, love love! For extra conditioning and to help with fly aways / frizz, add a little bit to your hair after you towel dry while it's still wet but before you add gel/styling product — it works wonders!
"
"
I have used this conditioner for years. It's very thick and good for cowashing curly hair.  It's a great price in the 32 oz bottles on Amazon compared to buying the product in smaller bottles at Salons. One complaint is that often the pump tops are faulty, which is a pain.
"
"
I am not going to be a crazy convert who thinks this is the only conditioner on the planet (though I did buy enough to last me forever), but I do like it. I went on vacation without it, and as always, my hair seemed to enjoy the conditioner of the day supplied by whatever hotel I was in. (Which is why I don't think it can be the be-all/end-all of hair care.) But it does lead to a pretty successful proportion of good hair days. My hair especially likes it when I add a little bit in as a leave-in conditioner after I get out of the shower.
"
"
Does not remove the knots well that naturally curly course tends to have. Made hair too soft so there was a lot of puffiness and frizz.
"
"
I've been using Deva One Condition for years, and the product I received from vendor Pharmapacks has clearly been tampered with. Smelled awful, like industrial cleaning chemicals, nothing like the typical scent of the conditioner.
"
"
I use this both as a regular conditioner and as a leave in, I have super thick kinky hair and I love this product.As a leave in, I definitely still have to add styling creams and a dab of argon oil, but this product doesn't weigh down hair while providing moisture. So if you are looking to use this as a leave-in and looking for something that will weigh down against shrinkage, you'll have to use something heavier in conjunction with this product because it isn't heavy at all.
"
"
I didn't like this conditioner. My hair hasn't been curling much since I started using it a few days ago, so I think this conditioner is weighing my hair down. It does have a nice floral smell, like roses. I wish I had stuck with my One Condition DeLight.
"
"
I experienced hair falling out more then usual so much so that,  I tossed the almost full bottle $33.00 conditioner.  The scent was also strange  and did not smell like the first bottle I purchased in the salon.  I'm done with hair products in Amazon save yourself the money $$$$  and save  your hair!!!!!  Buy products at salons and reputable vendors not worth the hair loss.  Horribly dissatisfied wish I could give it zero stars.
"
"
If you have super curly hair- this is for you !It is a miracle worker, just make sure to add moisturizer after
"
"
The best conditioner I have ever used! Amazing how it makes such a difference in the texture of my hair. It makes my curls soft and my hair bouncy and less frizzy. The only thing that would make this better is a more pleasant scent.
"
"
I went to the DevaCurl salon when the first opened 15 years ago in Soho and I've been using their products ever since. Could not recommend their stuff more. However, the price has gone up a lot.This review is just to point out that its cheaper to buy 2 32oz bottle separately then this combo pack together.
"
"
Smells like wax or like lice shampoo. Aside from that great product. If you’re going to buy 2 conditioners get the single one & just change the quantity to 2 because If you get the 2 pack you’ll pay like 15-16 dollars more than if you doubled the single pack.
"
"
This is the best conditioner I've ever used on my frizzy, dry, curly, color-treated hair. I sometimes use it instead of shampoo (I also use Deva Curl's No Poo) to clean the sweat out of my hair after a hard workout on the days when I don't want to use both the No Poo and the conditioner. You can rinse it all out or leave some in for extra moisture. My hair is never greasy. My only complaint is that the scent of this one (sort of a light Skittles scent) doesn't really go with the light rose scent of the No Poo. However, even when I use both of them, the scents don't linger in my hair, so there's no obvious clash.
"
"
I rotate my products routinely as I think it helps my curls. Deva Curl One Condition is definitely in the rotation and will be required on a day like today, when my hair is tangled in a rats’ nest.
"
"
As a woman with curly hair who has struggled for year (YEARS!!) to get it right, I had almost given up hope.  But due to peer pressure I tried this product and immediately fell in love.  The scent is heavenly, the feel simply marvelous.  My hair has never felt so soft and retained it's curl. I'm simply in love with it.
"
"
Loving DevaCurl One Condition...it is one of the few curly hair products that works better than I anticipated for hydrating and smoothing out my curls making them manageable...2 thumbs up!!!
"
"
My hair stylist recommended this but I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money. I'm happy  I did. I have thick, long curly hair and I love this product. I use it instead of shampoo on nights that I don't shampoo my hair and my hair feels clean! I've used other conditioners to do everything but I've never felt like my hair truly gets cleaned, especially my scalp. But this product works! My hair feels light and soft after using it. I usually use a diffuser after I shower and put a little product. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a new conditioner!
"
"
Oh my goodness!  Oh my goodness!! I absolutely love the smell of this conditioner and will continue to purchase it for that reason alone.  My hair feels so great after I use it and did I mention the smell???  Wonderful product!! My forever conditioner!! :-)
"
"
If you have curly hair, this is perfect for you!! You gotta try this & you won't regret it. The only product my kid will use on her hair. Seriously.....try it.
"
"
Purchased after reading ""Curly Girl The Handbook"" by Deva Curl, and I now only use DEVA products in my long curly hair.Following the recommendations from the book, I do not thoroughly rinse this out of my hair.  I have slowly worked up to only briefly rinsing my scalp and then squeezing all the excess out before wrapping in a soft towel to dry.  My hair stays soft & curly with no gunky feel. LOVE this stuff!I do use a TON of this to get through my long curls, so I use SUBSCRIBE & SAVE to keep a new bottle coming every month! :-D
"
"
I have curly hair and its tends to behave bad at most times until I started using this product. I stopped spending money on any other conditioner. I use this product every day and cant live without it. I would like it to smell like coconut (favorite frangrance) but the lemon grass smells good and clean. I use this together with the no-poo shampoo and daily deep conditoner by the same company. the product does cost a pretty penny but I think its worth the spurge. I save up and purchse it through amazon as its much cheaper than in the salon.
"
"
Devacurl products are amazing!! Learning how to care for my daughters beautiful ringlets has been a wild ride full of disappointing products whose marketing didn't live up to its word. With Devacurl she finally has soft, bouncy ringlets with minimal frizz even in our hot, dry summers. I highly recommend this product to everyone when they ask how I get her curls to be so tame yet beautiful.
"
"
Best shampoo for curly or wavy hair. The longer I use it the better my have gets. I never use anything else. My hair only requires washing every 3 weeks or so.
"
"
This is a fake product,  the texture, smell and how it leaves my hair is COMPLETELY different then the real stuff. Dont bother buying, the price is tempting but just lay the extra money and get the REAL stuff.
"
"
I've been using this for years now and I love it. I also dilute some in a spray bottle and use it as a detangler for my daughters.
"
"
There is a noticeable difference between this and other conditioners--and I can prove it!How?By how much my hair curls after using it. The more moist your hair, the more it will curl. My DevaCurl-trained stylist said it was true, but I've tested it. Nothing is better for my curls.
"
"
I've been trying to grow my super extra curly hair but have not been able to retain length. After a very expensive hair cut, I was recommended the DevaCurl projects and I use the One Condition Conditioner for all my styling needs, I no longer use gels, mousse, sprays... I only use this as a leave-in and as a styling products and I've experienced a lot less hair breakage and my hair is finally retaining length. Hallelu!
"
"
I love this product!  I was first introduced to the DevaCurl line through my stylist and I am so grateful.  This smells divine and goes on silky smooth. I love the pump nozzle because I gotta use a lot to get through my thick mane.  The value is amazing through Amazon. A+
"
"
I’ve been using deva products for several years and love them. I’ve ordered them a couple of times from amazon and they seemed to be the same quality as the product from the salon and deva website. This time, the conditioner is totally different. The scent is off and the texture of the conditioner is terrible - almost like a plasticy texture and not at all creamy. Would never order again.
"
"
returned it... it seemed diluted compared to the same product in a smaller bottle bought locally.  That being said, I don't think someone tampered with it but that the factory makes it thinner so it can settle in this big bottle. If it was the thick consistency it wouldn't be able to settle so you couldn't pump it out. That also explains the low price.
"
"
Wavy hair lady. Product I used to use wad discontinued and I have final found my new replacemnt! I am using the no poo shampoo. Conitioner and the light gel! Use lore product than you think you need!!! Does Not make my hair crunchy. I use the products then scrunch with a towel, add light gel then use diffuser w hair dryer. It probably  would air dry nice too. Super soft feeling! A must try for wavy / barely curly hair
"
"
Devacurl is expensive but worth it to me. I rarely find anything that works as well for my curls. I buy this big size twice a year.
"
"
I have been using this product for 2 years and love it. This along with No-Poo is the best products around. They do not strip your hair with harsh detergents or leave slimy conditioners in your hair. Leaves your hair almost tangle free. Love it. Fast shipping and a great price.
"
"
I used DevaCurl Products for a year and had incredible results. The last time I replaced my products I had a terrible reaction. This product caused my scalp to break out and become very itchy. My curls were dry, brittle, and undefined. It took weeks before my curls came back once I stopped using this product. The products are not the same as they used to be.
"
"
I absolutely LOVE Devacurl! Their products can be pricey, but they are absolutely worth it! It makes my curls look AMAZING!! 100% recommend!
"
"
I had read such good things about the Deva Curl line and talked to people who recommended it for my hair. Perhaps my expectations were too high. This product was very heavy and left my hair feeling heavy and weighed down. My frizz gets worse when products end up gummy like that so I can't with clear conscience recommend this. The Deva Curl line is generally more expensive than brands like Matrix. I have corkicelli curls that are prone to being frizzy and dry and this didn't help that at all.
"
"
I've tried many conditioners and this one is by far the best for my super curly hair. It keeps my hair soft weather I wash it or not. Thanks DevaCurl ☺️
"
"
This is my ""go to"" conditioner. I have very curly-kinky hair and I use a lot of conditioner every day. Deva Curl delivers just the right amount of conditioning without being to heavy. It gives enough slip so that I can comfortably comb through my medium thickness curly hair without excess pulling or breakage. I don't have to use so much product that I go broke either. It is a great every-day treatment. The smell is wonderful but not overpowering. I don't smell the conditioner after my hair is dry.
"
"
I LOVE Diva Curl products! Been using them for a few years now and I will never go back to normal shampoo/conditioner! My curls are healthier and springier and tamer than ever!
"
"
Works great on my natural curly hair.  The smell seems sour and is a bit off putting but goes away after a while.
"
"
I’ve used Deva Curl products for 3 yrs. I use and love all of them in the line. The Large pump bottle is sturdy and very easy for one hand usage. There is no strong scent, close to being unscented. My hair definitely feels softer, curlier and much easier to manage after using.These are my favorite hair products!
"
"
This stuff is really stinky.  I don't like it.  It is a light weight conditioner but nothing fabulous.
"
"
I’ve noticed a huge improvement in the condition of my hair after using this the first three months
"
"
Product seems fine but there are two globs of adhesive stuck to the bottom of the bottle, which is kind of weird and gross. May have to pour this into my old conditioner bottle if the glue doesn’t come off.
"
"
Nope... Not worth the money.. Not for me anyways... Everytime i use this.. My hair looks so damn dry and frizzy all day.... i seriously have this stuff...  1 star for the quick delivery and the smell....
"
"
I've been using this conditioner since January of 2012 when I quit fighting my curls. I've tried other brands too but this one is the best and this is a great price!
"
"
I've often struggled between products to find a good, all purpose hair conditioner. I had an afro for the longest time and would see my ends get brittle and dry quite often. After going to a Deva Curl specialized salon (with a bit of skepticism and a lot of cash), I was hooked on my new look, letting my natural curls go free. That was over a year ago and I haven't looked back since.Obviously, the salon recommended the Deva Curl products they used for daily maintenance. I bought a few different brands to try out - Deva Curl, Miss Jessie's, and Carol's Daughter - to see what the difference would be for daily care. The Deva Curl One Conditioner hands down provided the best, most sustainable results with added moisture without the hard texture of most foams and conditioners. I sometimes use their gels for a light hold but usually just use the conditioner and go. And I use it EVERYDAY with my hair actually growing out (hasn't happened in years).I'm a happy brand addict and love the large container since I use so often. If you are on the fence about Deva Curl, go for it! You won't be let down.
"
"
Do you have curly hair and want to make the most of your natural volume and bounce? Check out this product. You will be happy you did. Highly recommend getting a sampler first, and then coming back for the larger bottle.
"
"
This is not the real product. I was expecting the scent that the typical conditioner is but I opened it and all u can smell is straight chemicals.
"
"
My hair is amazing now since I have started using Deva curl!!
"
"
If you have curly hair, this is the conditioner for you...I use it with brown sugar to wash my hair, and then condition it after.  My hair seems to be much curlier.  Not too heavy, just perfect.
"
"
This is an excellent product, when it's authentic. Like many others here, I received very watered down versions, and I don't think it even has the same fragrance, so it may not even be Deva conditioner in the bottle. This is the second time this has happened, I will not purchase it from Amazon again.
"
"
One of the best products I've used for naturally curly hair. Its the only conditioner I use on my hair. If you have curly hair I recommend this highly. If you haven't read Curly Girl then you should. It should be required reading for hair stylists everywhere. I don't let anyone cut my hair that hasn't read that book.
"
"
I am a curly-haired, DevaCare fanatic.  This is one of the few products that truly controls my frizz and softens my hair.  Born with a mop of curls, I have learned that you get what you pay for regarding hair products.  Therefore, I buy the more expensive brands, like DevaCare, to receive high quality results.
"
"
This conditioner is a fake product. At first, it seemed like original DevaCurl products. Three weeks after use my hair started falling out in huge clumps! Do not use PharmaPacks to buy this product. It will ruin your hair.
"
"
This conditioner is good at untangling my hair, but is quite a lot thinner than what I received in a sample pack from DevaCurl.  This means I use a lot more of it per shampoo than I did of the sample.  It made me wonder if they had recently changed the product to make it thinner, rather than up the price.  I liked the sample better as it was easier to handle -- not so runny.  But it works - you just need more pumps.
"
"
Product arrived as seen in picture, conditioner has oozed out of the bottle. It doesn’t seem like a lot, but it’s a bit disappointing to spend this amount on conditioner only to lose some in the shipping. Item was packaged well, box not damaged. I suspect freezing temps might be the culprit.
"
"
Longtime user, live this for wavy or curly hair
"
"
I have curly hair, and have tried many products. Deva Curl  conditioner is wonderful. Just rub in and rinse and with the option of leaving it in for extra conditioning is just an extra bonus. I will never go back to using the old shampoo conditioner, this product and the whole line for that matter does not leave your hair greasy or weighed down, instead my hair is knot free and easier to style, either curly or straight.
"
"
Great for type 2 waves and curls. Contained protein which my hair loves
"
"
The smell is my favorite part. Curly hair must have.
"
"
I love this product. However I was disappointed that I received my conditioner today, and the cap was unscrewed so it got all over the box and I'm missing a good portion of my conditioner.
"
"
Yes, yes, and yes!!  Best smelling conditioner available for curly girls. I love that I can leave this in without finding out as well. I mix it with water and spray on daily. I love how soft my hair feels ❤️
"
"
I like the conditioning, but I didn't realize I was ordering the original scent and not the Delight scent.  I like the Delight better. Will pay attention next time.
"
"
It took a few purchases to find the Deva Curl products that my hair likes and when I did, I love my hair.  No fuss, No muss.
"
"
I have been using the Devacurl shampoo and loving it, so I decided to try their conditioner, too.It's a pretty light conditioner, but it's great for daily use (I don't wash my hair daily but I do condition it when I shower).The smell is a little sharp to my sense, though. Citrusy, but more in a cleaning-the-bathroom kind of way, rather than a tropical-getaway way. Maybe they have different scent options, if so I'll try them too.
"
"
Product came damaged and leaking as other's had described. Hoping the product hadn't been tampered with. Disappointed. Need new pump which is why I bought originally.
"
"
I've been using this for years.  I have pretty curly, very dry, very frizzy hair.  I have to wash my hair (well, get it wet, but not shampoo except for every 4 days) every morning in order to look civil.  I rinse and use this daily.  I'm very happy with it and it has a nice smell.
"
"
Been buying for years. Love it
"
"
This conditioner helps my curly hair detangle and I am able to comb it with my fingers in the shower (my hair is really thick and curly) But my mom also loves this conditioner as well and she has thick straight hair
"
"
Meh don't love it.  You end up having to use so much it leaves my curls limp, greasy, and does not really do anything to help with the super dry ends that suck moisture up like crazy. Houston's humid climate is a beast on delicate curly hair. I tried to mixing it with water in a spray bottle as a leave in conditioner and it's a little better that way. This is just not the holy grail for curly hair.  sigh----- the search continues.
"
"
Too heavy for me (fine, wavy, low porosity, 2B) but it might work for someone else so I'm giving it 3 stars to be fair. It smells like my grandma. It's subtle and not overbearing, but I don't like to smell like a cute little old lady, no offense grandma!
"
"
This conditioner is the best thing for my curly hair...I comb it thru in the shower, leave it in and rinse some of it out gently gently before applying deva arc angel gel....my hair stays frizz free with spiral curls for days. Love the Orange sherbet aroma. So glad to find this brand on Amazon!  It was recommended by the curly hair salon that I visit once a year.
"
"
He probado muchos productos para cabellos rizado y este ha sido, por mucho, el mejor.
"
"
When I received the bottle, I couldn't figure out how to actually use the pump. I tried twisting it all sorts of directions but never get it to puff up so I could use it. I got frustrated and ended up breaking the top, which stinks but was my fault for getting frustrated. I just used the product directly from the bottle without the pump and I must say, THE CONDITIONER IS AWESOME. It really leaves my hair feeling nourished and soft without leaving buildup. It smells a little funky but that's personal taste, I don't like lemongrass.I only gave it four stars because I couldn't open the dang pump. Otherwise it would have been 5, it is a very good product.
"
"
I have wavy hair and this product works great. It definitely works the best of all of the products made for curly hair that I've tried, like Ouidad, and some drugstore brands. It's very hydrating and used with the no poo shampoo, it leaves your hair frizz free and nicely wavy, or curly. My daughter uses this as well and her hair is much curlier and thicker than mine. It also doesn't weigh down the hair or leave it looking over conditioned. Great product.
"
"
Great for sensitive skin.
"
"
My girlfriend loves this.
"
"
Love the scent and how fresh my hair feels after this. I have curly hair that’s prone to frizz but this seems to calm down my hair without leaving it heavy
"
"
Love it and love the curl and def keeping in my reorders basket
"
"
The only curly hair conditioner I use
"
"
This is my favorite conditioner! I finally started learning how to really take the best care of my curly hair earlier this year and I started out using this product. Since then I have tried two others but the difference with Deva Curl is so noticeable. Leave a little on your hair as a leave-in treatment and you'll have soft, touchable curls all day long. Paired with some styling cream and a foam my hair is finally frizz-free without needing a sticky mousse or hard gel. I love my hair, but this conditioner helps me love it right.
"
"
The scent and texture is NOT EVEN CLOSE.  This product is a scam.  Do not purchase it.
"
"
This stuff has way to much hype. I have super curly hair and it didnt do anything for me. Not impressed. Didn’t help detangle or add curl structure at all.
"
"
LOVE this product and the pump bottle is SO much better than the smaller squeeze! I use it wet with plenty of water, light defining gel and B'Leave-in for perfect curls! Smells like Heaven, as well!
"
"
I like the product but, when it arrived, there was a good bit of the product that had leaked out so I don't feel like it was a good enough value for the money. Since it has a pump, it should have been packaged better.
"
"
..but I love the Decadence version much more.  This conditioner would probably be better for warmer climates with higher humidity.  In the place where I call home, we need more moisture.
"
"
My holy grail conditioner!
"
"
That's my second order. Best condition i ever had for my curly hair!
"
"
Use with my weekly wash and add a little to my daily water mist to boost my curls.
"
"
I have very curly hair. I've used this product for several years and even though I try other products I always come back to these products. They're the best for my hair. I use the shampoo and conditioner for colored hair.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Love Deva Curl products.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl products for about 4 years now. This is my favorite line of hair care products for my curly hair. The conditioner is light weight-not greasy at all and helps my curls stay shiny and well formed. I recommend Deva Curl Ultra Creamy Daily Conditioner for anyone with curly hair. I originally found this line at a small hair salon in Southern CA and had trouble finding it later. I was very happy to discover that I can buy it from Amazon.
"
"
The product description and picture said “Original” not “Decadence” I prefer the “original” scent (cleaner, fresher) to the Decadence (Coconuty) and that is why I ordered it. It came today, and the bag on it is labeled “original” but the product is the decadence. Is this an error? Do you not have the original?
"
"
Makes my hair feel soft and manageable. I like the no suds conditioner. Fast shipping and packaged well.
"
"
Love how soft this keeps my daughters hair. Only wish the scent was better
"
"
Expensive but works well and smells amazing. This product feels nice on my hair and doesn't have much of a scent. What scent it does have is very fresh and slightly lemony so that I am not overwhelmed by it. I have been getting lots of compliments on my hair since I started using it. I use it as a leave-in conditioner.
"
"
Something was wrong with this conditioner. It was almost as if it was mixed with something else. I have bought this conditioner before from Ulta so I know how it should feel in your hair and even in your palms and something was definitely wrong. Do not buy it, it was a waste of money and not the real thing.
"
"
This is the second time I’ve purchased this conditioner and I live by it now. Worth the money! Nothing has ever left my curls feeling so light and soft at the same time. Moisturizes without weighing down your curls
"
"
Originally, I loved the scent of this product.  However, after a few months, I noticed my hair was shedding way more than normal.  Low and behold, it was because of the Deva Curl. My hair is noticeably thinner. This is happening to a bunch of other people as well. AVOID FROM USING.
"
"
Deva curl products are great, I highly recommend them. BUT the product that was delivered to me was not an authentic Deva Curl product.  The conditioner felt more like a lotion and smelled something like bug-spray and rose water... nothing like the original product you buy in a salon. I went as far as speaking with a certified Deva Curl retailer about it to see if they had changed their product and was assured the one I received from here was a fake.
"
"
Smells gross, feels like it dries out my hair. I did not leave this conditioner in as it suggests but it just made my hair feel brittle and dry. I didn't like it at all! My hair looked nice but only after using Moroccan oil after this conditioner. I have thin, easily tangled hair and this didn't help to smooth my hair out at all, just tangled it up worse.
"
"
Great curly hair. Good price compared to box stores.
"
"
Been using for years, perfect for curly hair. Recommend the no pop shampoo.
"
"
I purchase this for my wife. She has curly hair and preffers the no poo method for her hair. This product does a good job of keeping her curls intact and making her hair soft and shiney. The product is a little pricey but its the only thing that works for her. I will buy it again.
"
"
Deva Curl is PERFECT for any curly haird person. No matter what type of hair or curls you have.  This was absolutely not a knock off product.
"
"
love deva curl products
"
"
Awesome
"
"
This is great stuff.  It protects the hair and if I just let my hair dry with it it just curls and looks great.  I use it a lot and highly recommend it.  Good quality. Buy some!
"
"
To be clear, I have thick wavy hair that is bobbed.  I thought that since this stuff is for curly hair it would be good for making my waves more pronounced.  I bought this, the Low Poo Shampoo and the B'Leave-In styling gel.  First off, all the scents smelled over-powering and fake to me.  They actually smelled like laundry detergent (talking Tide etc. here, not Mrs. Meyers).  Worse, they left my hair dried out and dull!  The first time it happened I thought it was the leave in styling gel, so the next time I just used the shampoo and conditioner and let my hair air-dry with no product.  My hair was still frizzy and felt like it was dead.  I have come to the conclusion that these are obviously not for my hair!  I went back to using my old stand-bys, EO Organics French Lavender shampoo and conditioner (much more natural, cheaper, more pleasant smelling and no nasty sulfates either).  Also applied Beauty Without Cruelty's Leave-In Conditioner.  My hair is back to being soft and shiny, just looks healthy.  I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this stuff.
"
"
I've been using Deva Conditioner for years and years.  I think this batch is old as it is very, very thick and I have to take the top of the bottle and squeeze it out that way.  It does not work it you try to pump it out.  Very disappointed and hope it doesn't happen again.
"
"
I love this conditioner. I love that it doesn't weight my hair down, that it doesn't have harsh chemicals in it and that it's specially formulated for curly hair. My curls behave so much better after using this conditioner! I have less frizz, fewer flyaways and overall better-looking, more manageable curls. I highly recommend this to anyone with curly hair! It's so so worth it!
"
"
My hair is so much softer and more manageable now that I have been using the Deva product line. I love it so much and I try to get everyone who has curly hair to use it. I never loved my hair until I read Curly Girl and started using the product line. Now I'm so proud of my unique curls. Definitely give it a try and give it a good month or so for your hair to start changing. It doesn't happen overnight!
"
"
I have very curly hair & my daughter has wavy hair. We both use this conditioner and it helps to keep our hair from drying out. It smells very nice & I love how it feels in my hair!
"
"
I don’t like it.  It actually drys my 3C curls out.  Bought another conditioner before I was even half done with the bottle.
"
"
Detangles pretty good. Awful scent
"
"
I have been a deva curl girl for a while. Definitely not the same product from a salon. Very thin conditioner that did not hydrate. Now I have to spend more money and go buy the product from the store. Oh well... Lesson learned.
"
"
Not the best conditioner but it’s ok. I have better conditioners or curly hair.
"
"
Always disappointing to have products leak on the way.  The top was not screwed on all the way, and about an inch's worth of product was inside the bag upon delivery.  Otherwise, I love this product.
"
"
This is the second bottle of Deva Curl One Condition that I've purchased through Amazon.  The first bottle was thick and creamy.  The second bottle came with a piece of tape over the top instead of shrink wrap and is definitely watered down - I got it through the amazon.com distributor G-Deal.  So I strongly suggest avoiding them, though they might not be the only distributor cheating us.Note that I really love this product - it does amazing things for my curls.  Maybe the only way to get the real thing is directly from Deva.

Great conditioning
"
"
I've ordered deva curl products about five times. Two out of the five times there was a problem with the bottle or tube. The pump didn't work on one and the wave makers was missing the flip part of the lid. I love the product but for the price they should pay more attention to the quality of the container therefore they get a three

"
If you have natural curly hair, then this is what you've been missing from life. Order now, thank me later.
"

This is an incredibly moisturizing conditioner.  I use it in conjunction with No-Poo and Set it Free.  I ""wash"" with No-Poo, condition with One condition, they apply more as a leave in after my shower.  I follow up with Set it free on my damp hair, and scrunch.  It has brought my hair back to life and beautifully defines my curls.  I love you Devacurl...don't ever change!
"
"
Finally a conditioner that works for my frizzy, wavy hair
"
"
This conditioner is a great detangler and moisturizer. I've used it on and off for 5 years.  The smell is pretty strong, kind of like lemongrass, lemon-lime, and kiwi. Any stronger and it would be too much IMO.  This works nicely if you follow the Curly Girl method the creator of DevaCurl invented and don't rinse all of it out.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't so pricey.
"
"
Makes my hair soft easy to detangle
"
"
I love this conditioner and have been using it for years, but the last time I bought it, the scent was off. One of my favorite things about this conditioner is the scent, so this is quite unfortunate. It still seems to work as well as usual, but I don't think I'll be buying this product online anymore in the future.
"
"
This stuff is positively stinky. There is so much perfume type scent to it that I could smell it, sealed, in a sealed envelope when it arrived. And the smell on my hair was just not good. Way too strong of a smell. Product was mediocre, I used it once and won't be using it again.
"
"
I am graced with no fewer than three different textures of hair on my one head: 3b, 4A, and 4b,  It is very difficult to find one product that works great and equally well throughout my hair.  This one does the job.  My hair -- all of it -- feels like silk after I shampoo or co-wash, and all the curls define themselves according to their type.
"
"
Not sue what the fuss is about-heard great things about this but after using it I wasn't any more impressed with the condition or curl factor than I am with any other salon product.  I'll stick with my usual regimen and skip this next time.  Can't justify the price here.
"
"
I like the smell of this conditioner and how it makes my daughters hair soft and shiny and mine too.
"
"
I absolutely love this product. Have been using it for 5 years and any time I deviate to something elseMy hair feels like straw.
"
"
Works great for curly hair! Been using this line for years.
"
"
Best product for curly hair! After trying Deva for over 2 yrs now I will never go back to anything else. My husband is African American and it gives his hair beautiful waves. This product literally restored my curls after damaging it with the flat iron for years. Thank you Deva!
"
"
This stuff is amazing! It makes my hair smell good for 2 days, and gives me curls, not clouds.
"
"
I don't understand all of the negative reviews stating the product is fake/diluted. I absolutely disagree!! This has transformed my hair, and is incredibly soft and healthy. I can't live without it. Thank goodness for Amazon's discounted price!!
"
"
Love Love this product!!
"
"
great conditioner, I also use it as a leave in conditioner on my daughters very coily curly hair. love devacurl products.
"
"
Causes extreme hair loss. I wish I had read other peoples’ Experiences sooner.  BUYER BEWARE!
"
"
I use this almost every other day and it has lasted me a year! The size is worth the price and it does wonders for my curls! I suggest the gel too.
"
"
I used to use organix conditioners which I loved because it had so much slip which is necessary for my 3/b/3c fro which can take almost 30 minutes to comb out. Turns out organix conditioner is full of unhealthy silicones which was creating a shield on my hair and not allowing absorption of any oils I added to moisturize my hair. My hair was feeling dryer and dryer until I educated my self about silicones. I decided to try deva curl because of all the rage.. This product is Seriously amazing. It has just as much slip as any silicone based conditioner and even felt like it deep conditioned my hair. I now scrunch some in my hair at the end of my shower without rinsing and then add even more after I have microfiber towel-dried my hair. This stuff is the biz ness!
"
"
If I could give it a -(neg) rating, I would.  It's awful.  Never again will I buy something I haven't already purchased at a salon. After all the great things I've heard about this product, it was really a let down.  Either it was NOT the actual No Poo in the bottle or No Poo is garbage.  I'll stick with WEN even tho I liked No Poo's PRICE so much better than WEN
"
"
I've been using Deva Curl One Conditioner as my sole hair conditioning product for over 2 years. So I know what it should look/feel like. The bottle ordered from this seller arrived OLD. As in, it's so thick and hard to get out of the bottle as to make it almost un-useable. Usually, a bottle will last me between a month and six weeks. I will only get 3 weeks before the product is too thick to come out of the bottle. Buy One Conditioner. Its really great. But buy it from someone else.
"
"
This is the best conditioner for curly hair and I'm absolutely in love with it!! Devacurl is such an amazing hair brand:) To the seller............ please don't discontinue this product!!
"
"
This is not an exaggeration, as far as haircare is concerned (though there are more important things).I have wavy/curly hair that is very fine and for the bulk of my life has done exactly what it wants to do. If I found a product that enhanced curls, I got frizz. If I found a product that lessened frizz, I got greasy, straight hair. Not good.This stuff is expensive, obviously, so if you have something that is cheaper that works for you, I would say don't mess with a good thing. But if you've been searching for a line of haircare products that will give you consistent, beautiful curls (I sound like their commercial, sorry), I would highly recommend not only One Condition, but also the No Poo, AnGel, and Let it Be, which really helps with frizz. They make other products but I haven't tried those. I first bought the sample pack (which includes all the products I mentioned), which was a great way to try the foundation products without spending a ridiculous amount of money. I would also recommend their book - I think it's called Curly Girl. I'm not sure it's worth buying but it's definitely worth reading.
"
"
This has been diluted or it’s a completely different product. Doesn’t even smell the same.
"
"
This is a high-quality, wonderfully fragranced conditioner which can be rinsed out fully, or only partially. Applying only a light rinse helps keep my curls in place. I've used this conditioner exclusively for more than four years and have no interest in trying anything else. It's definitely worth its price, by my standards.
"
"
Leave hair soft and curly. Smell is fabulous. Love the cost. No longer have to purchase from salons.
"
"
I love the stuff. Its a bit pricey, but a bottle this size can last me about 4-6 months. The scent isn't strong or overpowering at all, which I really like. And its not really thick and goopy, so it rinces out of your hair cleanly. I love this stuff. I've tried other conditioners and always come back to Deva. And I like that its up to $8 cheaper on Amazon!
"
"
This is the only conditioner that works great on my curly hair.  When I run out of it my hair looks like hell lol. I highly recommend it. Worth the cost and it will last you a long time.
"
"
This conditioner is wonderful in my hair and I always get compliments for the wonderful scent it has. The rich floral smell is supposed to be lemon grass, but it doesn't smell lemony to me. I actually like it better. It smells like those white flowers from the south, magnolias, I think.
"
"
I foolishly bought this product without reading the reviews and assumed it was authentic. It definitely is not - the smell is completely off and it does not work like One Condition does. Don't waste your money on this!
"
"
Simply the best condition for curly hair, hands down.  I get compliments on my hair all the time since I started using the Deva method of styling my hair.  This conditioner is key in the process!  Leaves my hair silky, tangle free, and easy to put gel in and let air dry for perfect non-frizzy curls.
"
"
I have crazy curly thick hair that tangles like nobodys business. My sister bought me my first bottle of this stuff and the price kind of threw me off at first. But after my first bottle I will not use anything else! It tames frizz removes tangles, truly a God send for any girl with curly hair!
"
"
I use this as a conditioner, and after final rinse, I let my hair drain for a while, and use it again to scrunch the girls, Keeps the frizz down and keeps the curl intact.  I have to use about 6 pumps for each washing, so get the big bottle. It goes fast enough. Smells nice.
"
"
My husband has very curly unruly hair.  Deva Curl are the only products he uses.  They're great because he's a low maintenance guy and these products help maintain his curls effortlessly.  The conditioner works well, his dry hair is moisturized and soft.
"
"
Like another reviewer, I couldn't even get my comb through my hair with this ""conditioner."" After using this with the low-poo shampoo, my hair was a dry, frizzy mess and my scalp itched. I didn't mind the smell. I didn't feel strongly about it one way or another but I can see how it reminds people of men's aftershave. Oh how I wish I had never wasted my hard earned money on this product.
"
"
Shipped fast.
"
"
love
"
"
This is an excellent, creamy, hydrating conditioner.  Good ingredients, pump works perfectly.  Expensive but worth it.
"
"
I originally purchased this conditioner along with the DevaCare No-poo.  I have really dry hair and was worried that this conditioner wasn't heavy enough.  But, it makes my hair super soft.  The best part is that it leaves very little buildup.  I've found that many other conditioners leave buildup that the No-Poo just can't remove.  Not the case with this conditioner.  I can use it with No-Poo and my hair still fills clean week after week.
"
"
Thanks
"
"
Received on time, love this stuff!  It does something special to my hair. I am black and white with very curly, nappy type hair. I love this stuff it makes my curls pop! Devacurl all the way. And the seller is perfect always on time and honest.  Keep it up
"
"
My favorite condition for my thin fine hair, it doesn't weigh it down, Love the smell!!!
"
"
I really like this product, it helps keep my hair soft and I like that it is sulfate free
"
"
Awesome product. I have been using it for years and always leaves my hair shiny. Technically it’s made for curly hair, but I have pretty straight hair that is a tiny bit wavy, as I still LOVE it! Totally worth the price!
"
"
Love diva curl products!!
"
"
The product arrived in a timely manner.  Purchased the daily conditioner for my 16 year old granddaughter who has very frizzy and curly hair. Since using the product, my granddaughter's hair has been less frizzy with a noticeable looser curl. My granddaughter has expressed she is pleased with the results.
"
"
Have used this for a while.  Priced good and great hair product
"
"
Love this
"
"
First came exploded all over box and had to be returned. This product is very different from the same ones I have bought in the past. Smell and texture. Just as the other reviews said. Shouda listened.
"
"
I have curly hair and live in South Florida (humid!!!!). Deva Curl products live my hair frizz less, defined and soft...I have so many complements on my hair. Tip: Read the Deva Curl book to learn the right technique base on your curl type.

I love the Deva Curl line.  I use them every day.  One Condition is amazing.
"
"
Love this! This the only thing I have used on my hair for 8 years.  Keeps my curls soft and bouncy and no frizz even if I brush it.
"
"
Amazing
"
"
I have wavy/curly hair and this conditioner is great.  I actually curls it more and separates the curls more.  My daughter has really curly hair and was so frustrated with it.  She absolutely loves this.  If you use it all the time you should wash your hair with baking soda once in a while, I guess just shake some up with water in a bottle.
"
"
For my hair, this is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used.  I switched for a time, to save some money, to Dove conditioner, but I have learned that products that contain dimethicone, like Dove, will make my hair look heavy and greasy.  When I apply Deva One Condition, my hair seems to soak it up and when it's time to rinse, very little rinses out.  It does wonders for my hair!  Worth the money!!
"
"
Es falso y malo
"
"
Excellent quality and great price.  This conditioner has saved my daughter's hair.  So glad I learned about this product, it has helped my daughter and my son take good care of their curly hair.  I would definitely recommend this conditioner for anyone.
"
"
I like the product BUT it came in plastic badg where the conditioner leaked out of bottle and smell was so overwhelming and hard to clean and bottle pump was defective.
"
"
Good price, great product with no harmful chemicals
"
"
I really like this conditioner - it smells great, is not greasy, is light, makes my hear smooth and full at the same time. I recomment it to people with fine hair, like mine. In the summer it makes my hear curly, but summer humidity makes it curly anyways, the conditioner just enhances the curliness.
"
"
I will be using Devacurl forever! The bottle was open a bit and spilled just a little.
"
"
Great
"
"
I love this conditioner. I use it everyday. It's super creamy and makes my hair soft and healthy. It's the only conditioner I will use. My hair dresser recommended it and she uses it.
"
"
love love love deva care one condition.  i have been using deva curl products for over 12 years and i recommend it constantly.  love the all natural ingredients.  love the way it doesn't weigh my hair down and cleanses my scalp.  gentle enough to use everyday.  love love love
"
"
The bottle was broken when it arrived and conditioner was all over the bottle. I have to unscrew the pump and run my hand along the ""straw"" to use the product. Since the product has a slippery texture, it's difficult to execute this procedure.
"
"
I love DevaCurl products.  This DevaCare is different then the DevaCurl One Condition.  Seemed very dry on my hair & with curls dry is already my problem.
"
"
Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!! I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time. I have recommended this products to all my curly-haired friend. So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...DevaCurl or DevaCare is it!!
"
"
Works great
"
"
It's really not it for my hair. I've had better. But this is also medium good.
"
"
I use this along with the low-poo shampoo and absolutely love it!  I've used it for over a year.  I have long, naturally curly hair that is fine and hard to manage.  This does not weigh it down.  I highly recommend it!
"
"
Switched to the Devacurl system and my hair is much healthier and my curls are more defined.
"
"
I am from European decent but have the driest, curliest, frizzest hair EVER!  In 38 years I have lookedfor a product that will make me tolerate my own hair.  This product actually makes me love my hair !!!  My hair is soft, mangable and has never looked so healthy.  It feels great while Im washing and after it dries.  If you have curly hair I promise this is the best product you have ever used!
"
"
My fiance uses this and loves it, it's a little cheaper than in stores and while some people say it's ""not the real thing"", she feels it is the real thing and does a good job
"
"
I've been using this product for over 10 years.  I don't know where I would be without it.I usually just use it in the shower and then scrunch my hair with the product in it.  Shampoo every 3-4 days as needed.  I have super healthy, hydrated hair.
"
"
I have semi-curly hair that tangles like mad.  Nothing I tried before would get the tangles out.  My comb slides right through after using this product.  I also use 1 pump as a leave in conditioner.  It does not weight my hair down, make it dirty or greasy.  It just makes it silky.  So grateful to have found this.
"
"
Love the deva curl products.
"
"
First time buying Deva Curl through Amazon. It arrived a day early and in perfect condition.  I love these products and they are so good to my curls. Don't think I'll ever use anything else again!
"
"
This product is fake. This is the first time i tried devacurl so i was surprised by the smell and watery texture of this conditioner. Just purchased same conditioner at ulta and what a difference! Wonderful conditioner when it's real. Please don't judge devacurl until u buy it from ulta
"
"
I have tried many different brands of conditioner over the years and this is by far the best product I've ever used on my long curly hair!! I've also followed the plan set up by Deva Curl and my hair is so much better overall.
"
"
When I received this product the bottle had busted open and there was conditioner everywhere in the bag it came in. The top is defective and doesn't work. I had to pour what I could salvage into another container. Extremely disappointed.
"
"
Born with unruly curls, I turn to DevaCurl for help.  This conditioner truly controls my curls.kinks and waves.  Preferring air to dry my hair, I often put a little dollop of the conditioner on my almost dry hair to ensure curl control.Beth
"
"
I have thick brown curls and I always use the DEVA line. I've tried so many others but I keep coming back to this one. The only thing is to buy the low poo (shampoo) and be mindful that it sometimes makes your hair look a bit greasy so sometimes I'll also use another shampoo just for the top as well.  I like using set it free spray after, but I wish it wasn't so expensive and I could buy a huge bottle instead of small.
"
"
I have to use more than it states but works well
"
"
If you have curly hair and haven't tried this yet, get some NOW!  It changed my hair completely.  I can even go without styling products and just put coconut oil in and my hair dries beautifully.  I will never go without this or the No Poo Shampoo!
"
"
I agree with other reviews.... there is something wrong with this product, it’s much thinner in consistency and the scent is horrible. My hair is damaged and starting to fall out
"
"
The second I put this on my hair I felt the softness and detangling while in the shower was a BREEZE!!! Love the way my hair feels now!
"
"
I agree with all the glowing reviews on this product.  It's the best conditioner I've ever used.  HOWEVER, please be aware that the Ultra Creamy Daily One Condition is the product with a sharp, soapy smell.  The One Condition which is labeled ""No Fade"" is the product with the wonderful orange smell DevaCare One Condition, No-Fade Ultra Creamy Conditioner 32 fl. Oz (946 ml).  I accidentally ordered, and now must return, this soapy smelling product.  Also, aside from a great hair conditioner, the anti-fade version is also remarkably effective at preserving hair color.  I'm impressed.  Hope this doesn't create confusion, but thought you should know so you don't accidentally order the wrong thing.
"
"
Love DEVA curl, almost everything in their line..I like the original over the decadence stuff.
"
"
I love the silky feel I get when I rinse this product from my hair. It makes it easy to get a wide tooth comb through as I am rinsing, which is the only time I comb my hair. I give it 5 stars for that silky feel. But this product does not help my hair curl. I use Rockin Ringlets for that from another company.
"
"
No problem with product not being original as others experienced.The fragrance is too strong for my tastes, but it fades & is the best product for my crazy hair.A quality conditioner.
"
"
Works well for conditioner to calm curly hair, especially in humid weather  Also great as a substitute 'shampoo'
"
"
I am caucasian and have dry wavy hair. My daughter has very curly hair.  I thought this might be good for us as we have hard water and our hair has been getting frizzy and damaged, but it just didn't work well for us.  Not quite thick enough.  Took a lot of product to condition our hair.
"
"
I love this product, I have curly hair and I love how it makes them soft and moisturized
"
"
The Devacurl products are amazing. The effectiveness of this product is almost hard to believe! I'll bet it would make even straight hair curl! My hair looks like I've had a perm when I use it.
"
"
I have s'wavy/curly hair and I have used DevaCurl/Deva Care products exclusively for almost 10 years.  This conditioner is fabulous for curly hair when used with DevaCurl/Deva Care No Poo and Gel.
"
"
It works better than most conditioners but I feel like I have to use a lot of the product to cover my whole head (because of the thick consistency). I recommend leaving it in for a few minutes before washing it out to get as much moisture from the product as possible.
"
"
I use this one condition every day. I wash my hair one or two times a week but condition every day. This conditioner is creamy and washes out clean. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I've found.
"
"
I love One Condition! I haven't found a better conditioner. My boyfriend's barber (of all people) introduced it to him for dandruff. He uses it alone without shampoo, and it very satisfied. I'm sure the name scares off potential male customers.
"
"
Having curly hair this is the  best product I've found that doesn't weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.  It provides a good conditioning without the frizziness and the curl looks great.  Seller was prompt in delivery and the packages was well packed.
"
"
I've tried dozens of hair conditioners but most didn't make my hair curl -- just frizzy.  But on the advice of a co-worker I tried the Deva products and I'm astounded at how well they work.  The conditioner makes my hair soft and gives my curls definition without frizz.  I'm a huge fan!
"
"
Love this product !! It is amazing cant believe they stopped making it
"
"
Pump does not work!!! Too hard to squeeze from big bottle.
"
"
This is NOT a Deva product. It doesn't have the same fragrance or texture as DevaCurl One Conditioner. I don't know if it's old or what, but I would like my money back.
"
"
Love this product! Highly recommend for women/girls who want to go natural. Read her book, the Curly Girl Manual.
"
"
Makes your hair really consigned well with out being greasy
"
"
The product came to my home broken. The pump broke but the item itself surely did work on my hair. I already have natural curly hair and this product really defined it. I would purchase this again without hesitation! But hopefully the next time I order this the pump will be in one piece.
"
"
I purchased this product in hopes that it would really hydrate and moisturize my hair, however it did none of those things. I have very curly dry hair this product didn't help keep my hair moisturizer at all. Won't purchase again.
"
"
IT IS DILUTED WITH WATER... IT RUNS OFF MY FINGERS. I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER COUPLE OF TIMES AND IT WAS ALWAYS EXTRA THICK, IT HELPED ME TO COMB THROUGH MY CURLS.BUT THIS PRODUCT IS SCAM!!!!BEWARE IT IS SCAM!!!
"
"
This conditioner is so thick I can barely squeeze it out of the bottle.  It doesn't seem like authentic Deva Curl conditioner or it is so old that it has thickened up to a consistency of a thick cream.
"
"
I have frizzy wavy hair.  This product makes my hair feel clean and it smells amazing.  My hair is below my shoulders, and I only have to use a quarter size amount.  It makes my hair curl when shower at night and go to sleep with it wet.  It also looks great when I blow dry straight.  I use the One Condition conditioner with the No Poo cleanser.
"
"
Been using this product as my go to for years.  One of the best curly girl brands on the market.  Arrived on time and in good condition. Excellent price.
"
"
This is the best conditioner for people with unruly curly hair. You can also use it as a leave-in conditioner which makes a really great styler. I didn't discover it on Amazon but decided to buy it off Amazon because it was cheaper here than at Ricky's NYC.
"
"
DC products destroyed my hair and scalp. Please use caution if considering any DC products!
"
"
Love all Deva curl products.
"
"
I recently got my hair cut by a curl expert, and she recommended this conditioner to me. It does it's job so well.My boyfriend can't keep his fingers out of my hair and my mother and sisters are all clamoring for my secret! Will buy again and again!
"
"
Best curly conditioner ever and smells fantastic!
"
"
I'm really enjoying this conditioner. Very light/moisturizing and I like the fact that it doesn't have all the toxic ingredients in it.  Thank you.  Would definitely recommend to others.
"
"
Used this product exclusively for over 3 years. At some point this product changed and I have noticed it has been causing my hair to thin. Do not recommend.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl products for over last two years and have been very pleased with the product and results, until recently when decided to buy it on Amazon instead of the salon to save a few dollars. What a mistake. I am convinced this is not the same product! It should be called ""No Condition"" as it has left my hair as if it wasn't conditioned. I have noted from other customers saying that it has been watered down, maybe, I don't know. It's a waste of money and time.Signed,Disappointed
"
"
I have been using Deva products for a couple of years now. The product I received leaked when I got it. It is watery and doesn’t even smell the same as real Deva curl products.
"
"
Makes my natural hair soft
"
"
I'm a committed Deva Curl Girl. Use this and the gel, and your curls are set! Nothing works better.
"
"
I was looking for a product that will give softness and moisture back to my curls and this is not the product for me.
"
"
Upon reading all the wonderful reviews about this product, I decided to buy this and the Lo-Poo by Deva. BIG mistake. This actually left my hair hard and my curls flat by morning. I was very disappointed in this product and really wanted to like it, but after numerous attempts, alas, it just does not work for me. A hefty price to pay for a product that does nothing but leave my hair smelling perfumed, hard, dry, and flat by morning! I do however use the Deva gel and it's great. Just too bad this was not the same. I will continue to be a ""curly girl"" and use L'Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Conditioner that is 100% vegan and not tested on animals with no animal byproducts.
"
"
When I started my natural journey, the Devacurl line were the first (and only) products I used. However, I transitioned to other products because I thought I needed a thicker conditioner than this one. Recently, as of 2016, I have went back to this staple product of mine to condition my hair really well. I wash my scalp and rub a little on my hair, then wash it out with cold water. I will reapply a light layer of this product, and put in leave-in conditioner afterwards, or a heavier conditioner as a leave-in.
"
"
I like it . It’s very good For my hair and worth the price 👍🧡. I ordered 3 for all my sisters 🧡But i have a problem in my new order you will see it in the pics
"
"
I have naturally wavy, fine, somewhat dry hair, but with this product I can make my natural wave turn into soft natural curls.  I usually combine it with the DevaCurl Frizz Free Foam, use a diffuser, and am able to get some amazing curls.  I use this product in the shower and rinse it, but apply another small amount to my towel dried hair and leave it in.  It doesn't weigh my hair down and really helps keep it from looking dry whether I straighten it or leave it curly.  This is my go to for sure oh and it smells great!
"
"
Very thin, watery conditioner.  Left my hair feeling dry and fly-away.
"
"
I found the Deva curl line of products life changing when I discovered that my hair is naturally wavy--this conditioner along with the no-poo shampoo and light-defining gel really has given my hair a new life and volume I never imagined it could have.
"
"
I couldn't live without this product. I have really curly hair, and this conditioner is just the right mix of moisture/hold without being too heavy. I typically leave it in and then use the curl cream. Highly recommend!
"
"
I love the Devacurl conditioner and that it can be used as a wash out conditioner or leave in conditioner. Keeps my curls healthy and soft.
"
"
I love the Deva products! I highly recommend that anyone who has wavy or curly hair that they're not quite sure what to do it give it a try
"
"
Conditioner works well.  First bottle arrived broken.  Amazon fixed the problem.
"
"
This is not the One Condition I always order.  Deva Curl One Condition is white in color and has a disctint aroma. This is beige in color and has no scent.  I don't know if this was a knock off of Deva product, but it is not what I usually order.  I don't hate it, but wouldn't reorder.
"
"
Been a Deva Curl product user for several years now.  All of their products are good value for the price.  Works great and smells awesome!
"
"
I use it every day! Love DevaCurl Products. This is a great daily conditioner!
"
"
The bottle states paraben and silicone free, yet they are both ingredients listed.
"
"
it was ok
"
"
Use as leave in conditioner on curly hair

I first used the DevaCurl trial kit that I had purchased from Ulta Salon and fell in love with the product.  I wanted a larger quantity for me and my daughter so I purchased the 32oz pump. It was too expensive at Ulta so I tried Amazon, since it was cheaper.  The product is different.  I will not purchase again, it seems to be watered down.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
I love Devacare One condition, but since switching to this conditioner my scalp has been really dry.  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have to put LOTION on my scalp because it itches so badly.  When this bottle is empty, I'm going back to One.
"
"
It’s a good product but for my curly hair I need more slip to help with detangling. I’ll stick with the Decadence Conditioner.
"
"
Love this conditioner and love that it's available for Subscribe & Save. I sometimes use it for cowashing, and always for conditioning, and after rinsing, I put a little more on and leave it in.
"
"
FAKE. Completely different industrial-smelling scent that does not match any of my other deva one condition bottles. Do not buy. I’m scared to know what I just washed my hair with!
"
"
Do you have naturally curly hair, and you love your curl...?Then there is a wonderful line of producs with this brad that you will love.I am now spoiled by this stuff and can use nothing else for cleaning and styling.
"
"
Love how moisturizing this product is! As a 3b/c curly girl this is the best conditioner I’ve used thus far.
"
"
Love the product but pump was broken into pieces. Probably from shipping.
"
"
not the real product
"
"
It made my hair tangle free and easier to brush out.
"
"
Travel size!  Happy with product.
"
"
I like this conditioner okay, though I wouldn't say it's done anything really insanely different to my hair. It's nice and lightweight, and the smell totally reminds of the beach. Not sure what it is. May or may not buy again, I'm still undecided. I also like that it has no parabens.
"
"
Its an excellent product to use frequently
"
"
I love this Daily Conditioner!  I use it each time I shower to restore and hydrate my curl.  I reorder each time I am close to running out.
"
"
Pump does not work!  Conditioner pump opening not sealed, and conditioner leaked out during shipment.
"
"
as advertised
"
"
My daughter has been using Deva Curl for years! Recommended by my long term hair stylist I bought it. She is now 18 and wouldn't use any other brand!
"
"
I don't leave the house without this in my hair.  I also water it down to make it last longer.
"
"
I've bought this product before in a smaller bottle and was very pleased with results.  My curls held together nicely and it kept frizz down.  This larger bottle seems to have much less fragrance, which is disappointing because I love the scent.
"
"
I love this conditioner. It protects my curly, fine, long hair and keeps my color from washing out longer.
"
"
Lovely scent, great product.  This and the lo-poo shampoo is all I use.
"
"
Great product for my dry curly hair.
"
"
Having suffered with curly frizzy hair for years, I was thrilled to finally find a product line that winter spring summer and fall never fails me.  I use this after no pooing with deva curls ""no poo"" and between the two products my mass of thick untamed curls and frizz becomes more than manageable....  it becomes soft and silky.I know you are supposed to wash curly, frizzy hair less frequently but with the deva curl line there doesn't seem to be any problem with washing way more often.  And, frankly, my mop of hair looks much better the day of a washing or the day after so I am thrilled to have a product I can use more often.  And you don't need a lot so this bottle is going to last a good long time.BOTTOM LINE:  This product has been an amazing antidote for my lifelong struggle with the thick, curly, frizz mop head of hair I've carried around forever
"
"
I'm a big fan of Deva products and this conditioner is light and great for everyday use.  It's also good to leave a little in the hair as a ""leave-in"".  Doesn't build up and is very gentle on color treated.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair (thick, coarse coils; tangles easily) I have been searching my whole life for the best conditioner for my hair type... DevaCurl One Conditioner is by far the winner!! I use in conjunction with the ""no poo"" cleanser, as well as finish with DevaCurl gel & my hair has never been so easy to manage,!
"
"
Love how smooth and silky my hair feels afterwards
"
"
For those of us with naturally curly hair, this conditioner easily detangles and does not weigh down your curls-if you use the no-poo with it, there's an even better curly result-AT LAST! Thank you!
"
"
Unfortunately, it's not something I can afford. It was a one time treat for my daughter but sadly not something I can have as a regular hair treatment in my home.
"
"
Love this product for my daughter's thick curly hair. Gives moisture. After one application I can easily comb her hair while product is in.
"
"
I've used this product for years and have gone back and forth with other conditioners but this works best for my very curly hair.  It smells great too.  I don't use the companion shampoo because it makes my hair too flat.  Still looking for the perfect shampoo on that end.
"
"
Good stuff - I'd buy it again. (I won't have to for a long time, as it doesn't take much and the bottle I have will last forever.)
"
"
It detangles my hair so well and leaves it moisturized
"
"
Bought it as a gift for my granddaughter who has curly hair.  Have not given to her yet
"
"
Makes my hair silky soft, but doesn't weigh it down.  Works seamlessly with the No Poo.  LOVE IT!
"
"
I have used and love DevaCurl because it takes out my tangles and makes my hair smooth. Unfortunately the one I received from Amazon was watered down and way less effective than the real stuff. It smelled the same but did not work as well. You think you're saving money but the quality is not as good. Buy it from a store or the real site.
"
"
It can leave a waxy feeling at times when you leave it in, but it creates great curl definition, and I've been able to maintain my hair longer with it than other conditioners I've left in using the curlygirl method.
"
"
This is the best conditioner and I've been using it for years. But this bottle seemed very watery.
"
"
This is the worst conditioner for curly hair.  The shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft and then you put this in and it feels dry.  I prefer S-Factor Smoothing.  I always try to find something cheaper but I keep returning to S-Factor!
"
"
1st MUST go to product in my hair regime. Fabulous! Leaves hair soft silky and shiny.  Not much needed.
"
"
Great value!
"
"
Product came with lid unscrewed and a lot of the conditioner was spilled in the bag around it. I expected better than this. Would not buy again for the reason.
"
"
I love devacurl products !
"
"
Don't look for anything else, this is the best conditioner
"
"
Having discovered DevaCurl, I'll never use anything else. Other shampoos and conditioners left my hair frizzy or oily, but this conditioner is a game changer. Paired with other DevaCurl products, my curls come to life!
"
"
I have very long curly hair and it can be very frizzy if I don't use the right product.Well. I read all the reviews and thought I would try it. I LOVE IT! My hair is much easier to comb out(in the shower with it in my hair) It has a nice scent to it and it works great! I have alot of hair, its on the thinner side. I wash my hair 3 times a week. I just put this product in and let it stay on my hair for about 10 mins. rinse and thats it. I am going to try the whole line of curly girl. If you have a chance you should try the sample pack and see for yourself.
"
"
Works great!
"
"
I love Deva Curl products! It’s perfect for curly hair!
"
"
Ive been using the Decadence line and just switched to the original.  Its great and I find my curls are a bit bouncier!
"
"
This is just ok. I did a review on the wash and I don't like either. I spent a lot of money on mediocre products. I would suggest Terressential hair wash. It's a wash but it leaves your hair silky smooth.
"
"
It came opened and some was spilled in the bag
"
"
I have been buying Deva Curl for years and this version is not the real product. The smell and texture are both off. Beware of fake products.
"
"
The best for curly hair.
"
"
My daughter, sister and I all use this product and all Deva care products faithfully!  Not only are you promoting a clean earth, but you are also giving your own body a chance to experience the greatness of organic body care.  Natural curls are happy! Color stays longer! Hair is soft yet manageable and has volume.  I do find that if I use my other organic shampoos now and then, this product works even better for me.  My daughter has very kinky hair and she finds that Deva helps to relax her curls to make them manageable.  We are trying to get our local salon to care the product.  Try it!  You will like it!
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVESince I've been using this product line my hair has never been more manageable or healthier. My waves have minimal frizz now and look amazing. My hair dresser said my hair was in amazing condition even though it was 3 months since my prior trim. Read the Curly Girl book and try the products. AWESOME!
"
"
Received my order today, glad I opened my box as the cap was cracked and it had started to leak!
"
"
Hydtrates my hair and makes it super easy to detangle. Make sure you let it SOAK IN. Finger comb in the shower and you're good to go.
"
"
I love DevaCurl products.  I purchased this product versus the DevaCurl decadence conditioner because I like the smell of the original DevaCurl line.
"
"
This products does not do well with my fine hair and I do not like the smell - it is somewhat citrus-y but not really pleasant to me.  I don't find it works as well as some other drug store brands I use - like L'Oreal - so I am not planning on buying this again.
"
"
I exist on Ramen so that I can buy One Condition, but purchasing it on Amazon helps ease that a little bit.  I paid under $30 here, whereas the cheapest I can get it in town is $42.  I use it every day both in and out of the shower.  It doesn't weigh my curls down, and after decades of crap hair, I finally have something of which to be proud.  It's worth the price, although my friend said she felt like she was rubbing money into her hair.  I'm comfortable with that feeling, if what I get out of it is awesome curls.
"
"
My boyfriend's barber (not a stylist, just a barber!) recommended this product instead of shampoo. BF was a bit turned off by the name, but tried it and we both use it now! This is a good size for 2, lasts 4-5 weeks.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl products for the past  year and love it for my hair. This time I tried to save some money and ordered the One Condition from amazon. Big mistake. The product is definitely fake. It is not the same. I have used the one conditioner for a while I know how it makes my hair feel. This one from amazon made my hair feel rough. Also the neck of the bottle for the Deva conditioner that I buy directly from Devacurl website has some number codes on it. This one from amazon does not have it.I contacted Amazon by email indicating my concern even though I had passed the return timeline as I had some stock and opened this one after finishing the one I had. I must say that Amazon's customer service is fabulous. They refunded my entire money for this product and assured me that they will contact the supplier for this stock.Thank you amazon. A tip for anyone wanting to buy Devacurl. Please only buy from their authorized dealers. I would not purchase this from anyone else.
"
"
I don't have curly hair, but I still love this conditioner.  It makes my hair look nice and have a lot of body.  It's expensive, however, so I use it sparingly.
"
"
I have medium thick 2c curls and have tried and loved DevaCurl's No Poo and Light Defining Gel and I purchased the 32oz bottle confident that I would love it, but I don't. This feels good in the shower and right afterwards but by the end of the day my scalp is flaky and dry and my hair gets frizzy and feels like straw. The smell is slightly unpleasant too, like hair dye. Maybe I should buy directly from Deva Concepts. Anyway, I am so disappointed. I'm returning this and trying different conditioners.
"
"
I thought this would be a great product.  Not really.  It did not offer control, and the product left my hair sticky.
"
"
The only conditioner for curly hair.
"
"
been using deva products for about 4 years and i absolutely love.  i was using the deva curl one condition but forgot that the deva care is for color treated.  what a difference!
"
"
Does wonders for my curls! I'm never going back!
"
"
My hair is usually a curly tangled mess, and a friend recommended this product; it really made a difference.  Only one other product comes close, I like the Ouidad line too...but Deva is a little bit better for my hair, it keeps the curls curly and looking natural.  Not like I put gel in it, just soft curls.  And it makes my hair feel healthy.  Very mild scent.  I highly recommend for curly hair.
"
"
The item was just as described and arrived super fast!
"
"
This product is known to cause hair loss and damage. They are in the middle of a class action lawsuit.
"
"
The top the press pump was not working but decide to keep it
"
"
This one was good. The other one was a fake.
"
"
Boughtthe no poo.  Loved it. Thought this woild be great as well. Not so much. Not creamy at all.  Feels less conditioned than when I rinse out the no poo.
"
"
Curly hair can be a challenge if the correct products are not used.  That's why I love this conditioner.  I use this as a shampoo and a conditioner, and my hair feels so soft and is more manageable.
"
"
I have used this product for years now, and i usually buy it off amazon because it saves me about $10 than if i were to buy it in store.. this whole line is just heavenly for my hair!! If you have curly hair, YOU MUST TRY THIS!!!
"
"
This is a great product at a great price!  I only use deva on my curly hair!
"
"
This product is moisturizing, but the smell sickens me.  I don't know if they've changed it since I started using it a decade ago, but something about it isn't right and I cannot use it!
"
"
Produuct is amazing for curly hair! I recommend it to all my curly haired friends.
"
"
Produuct is amazing for curly hair! I recommend it to all my curly haired friends.
"
"
OK, I love the regular one conditioner and thought this special version for colored hair would be just as great -- not so much. My hair looks dull, and it's not even close to the soft feel it had with the regular care one conditioner. I will use this up, but will not buy it again. I'll go back to the original.
"
"
Love this product but mine arrived with the spout busted and conditioner all over the topOf the bottle. 😕
"
"
I love this product.  It works great for my curly hair and frizz .
"
"
There is a law suit for this productMakes your hair fall out
"
"
I much more prefer this Deva Curl Conditioner over the DevaCare.  Even better is the new decadence conditioner.
"
"
best product out there.
"
"
I like all of the Deva products
"
"
I like the way my hair feels after using Deva Curl Conditioner.
"
"
Excelente como todos los productos de esta marca
"
"
I don't like to shampoo every day and this conditioner keeps my non-curly, dry to medium hair in good condition without it being all greasy after day two.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Product is great but it arrived damaged. Need it now so don’t have time to return/replace.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Favorite hair product
"
"
I can see and feel the difference using this conditioner. I wish it wasn't so pricey because I go through it in like 3 weeks...it works better than anything I've tried. I have type 3c and 3b curls. I like in a high moisture area. I'd recommend it. I think the decadence version works even better for my type of curl, but this one was a little bit cheaper.
"
"
Love the entire line.
"
"
I've been a Deva devotee for years. Curly hair is dry and Deva products nourish and make hair look great.Price is key since there are so many options. This is a great price so I'm thrilled.
"
"
Great price.
"
"
Something may be wrong with this product. I have purchased it directly from the Deva Curl website and when I received it it had a creamy texture with an off white/beige color. The product that I received from this seller is not as creamy, white color, and not as effective. I may be wrong, but seems like its a different quality. I will be purchasing it from Deva Curl directly from now on. It's not worth the risk.
"
"
Best product I've found for curly hair so far!
"
"
I love this conditioner.  the only thing I don't love is the price altho is does last very long.  I have naturally curly hair and i can tell when i use the devacare products
"
"
This product is not authentic Devacurl.  Different smell and not close to the same quality.  Very disappointed.
"
"
I like it for a daily conditioner
"
"
Love this conditioner and use it when I want to wear my hair wavy as it conditions but doesn't make it heavy.
"
"
This seemed like a counterfeit bottle...couldn't figure out what was wrong with my hair!  Bought from Healthiest Choice...should have returned it.  Bought another bottle from Salon Expo and it was fine (back to what I expected). Be cautious who you buy this product from.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Awesome conditioner, one of my FAVES!!!!
"
"
I've been using Deva Care No Poo and One Condition for over a year now and I love them.  I was on the brink of getting Japanese straightening and in a last ditch effort to manage the curls I decided to get a Deva cut at a local salon.  It kind of changed my life. My stylist gave me a Deva cut and then showed me how to style my hair using the Deva products and it made such a huge difference. I love this stuff and can't live without it.
"
"
Love this product, I’m a fan, has transformed my hair.
"
"
Great product for curly hair that tangles
"
"
I absolutely love the product. However when I opened the package there was conditioner everywhere! I was completely out so I didn’t want to wait for another one to be sent.
"
"
I like the product, however who ever packaged it glued the bag to the cap of the conditioner.....
"
"
WRONG PRODUCT does NOT match description
"
"
Love it!
"
"
These products have been the perfect solution for my family as a curly girl household! We always had problems with dryness and maintaining moisture but not with Devacurl! It's sort of pricey in the stores but more affordable on-line and worth every penny. I really love the scents and the natural ingredients don't damage our fragile hair.
"
"
Always love One Condition for my curls!
"
"
Always love this conditioner and will always order it. The one issue was that it was not shrink wrapped and leaked onto the other items in the box.
"
"
Works well, however the scent is extremely strong. It smells like industrial restroom soap. But my hair looks nice. So.... guess I’ll smell like a truck stop until it runs out. Yay?
"
"
If you are a Diva Curl user - can't beat this price - I think this size lasts 6+ months.
"
"
My hair eats this stuff up since I live in a dry climate. If you have curly or wavy hair and you're not already using Deva products, what are you waiting for?
"
"
Love this product. Does wonders for my curls
"
"
I love this product.  Leaves my hair very soft.  Perfect for curly hair
"
"
This conditioner is fabulous for curly hair. My daughter is bi-racial with Black and Hispanic curls. When I use the conditioner and shampoo together her hair looks beautifully healthy. I can see a big difference from other products...and I have tried many.
"
"
Over hyped
"
"
My biracial girls and I have been using this stuff for years and we love it.  We use it as a leave-in and a 'no poo' cleanser.
"
"
I love this, it and the other Deva Curl products. Started using over a year ago and I'm a happy curly head. Soft curls without a gunky or sticky feel. Keeps hair from feeling dry or frizzy.
"
"
My daughter and I use this product every day!  We love it!  We both have curly hair.  We use DevaCurl Low Poo, this conditioner and the Ultra Defining Gel.  Shipping was fast and the price was good!
"
"
Best conditioner for curly hair DONT @ me
"
"
After purchasing this for years off of Amazon and never having a problem, my luck has run out and I got a ""fake"" product. It has the smell and consistency of cheap lotion, and by the way it just sits on my hair, weighing it down and just smelling awful, I'm pretty sure that's all it is, with an expensive DevaCurl label attached to it. Do yourself a favor and buy direct from the Deva site.
"
"
This is a great conditioner for kinky curly girls.  I use the devacurl routine (see the internet) and my kinky/frizzy hair comes out in soft, shiny non-frizzy, bouncy curls.  They last two days, too.  I don't quite rinse all the product out, then finish by scrunching A LITTLE ""Heaven in Hair"" and ""ArcAnGell firm"" through my wet hair.Great price on Amazon--much less than in stores.  I often get two days of curls from this routine.
"
"
Great stuff for curl haired individuals out there; been using it for years and am always pleased.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
AMAZINGGGG. deva curl saved my curls. love love love it.
"
"
Great for my curly hair!
"
"
Have been using this product for years. Always get comments on how wonderful my hair smells and how soft it looks. Never ""builds up"" after lots of use and actually used this in place of shampoo for the first year. Highly recommend this product.
"
"
Best conditioner I ever tried !! I don’t need a lot to untangle my hair . I also use this product on my 2 year old and leaves his curls very soft !!
"
"
Used this for 2 years. I have fine 2b/c hair. Conditions, protects, lightweight, moisturizes to prevent frizz
"
"
My favorite of all Deva products. The smell is heavenly and it softens my hair at just the right level.
"
"
my daughterl oves it great for curly hair
"
"
This is the only conditioner that I use, and works best with the other DevaCare products:  Gel and NoPoo.  watch the firms on the DevaCurl website to see the technique.
"
"
Very low quality. Waxy. I don’t believe this was a real DevaCurl conditioner.
"
"
If you have natural curly hair this stuff is great. My daughter has long curly hair and since using this stuff her curls have gotten more corkscrew like. I have short curly hair and it has made a huge difference in the texture and curl. My curls are soft and more ropey like. We both get comments about our hair all the time.
"
"
Product highly toxic do not buy
"
"
I tell everyone I know with curly hair about this porduct!
"
"
I like that this conditioner is versatile. You can use it as a leave in or wash it out if you choose. It really leaves my hair moisturized and it smells good too.
"
"
just the smell alone makes this conditioner a winner. It is pricey but you only need a small amount to get the job done and it is so much healthier for you hair.
"
"
Conditioner was very very thick.  It would squeeze out of the pump neck when dispensing.  Have real doubts this is authentic DevaCurl product.  Certainly unlike any DevaCurl I have even bought.
"
"
I like the product very much.
"
"
Doesn't smell or behave like the original.
"
"
This conditioner is wonderful and smells wonderful!  My pump was broken but I managed to empty it by keeping the lid off.  I like the conditioner much better than the shampoo.
"
"
I've read rave reviews on this product and I tried it.  It's okay.  Maybe I am just cursed with coarse, dry hair.  I'll use up the rest of the bottle and see if I get better results.
"
"
This product caused scalp issues and dry, brittle hair.
"
"
Good product, conditions well. Can leave residue if used on the daily basis.
"
"
I've used this condition for a about a year now, but they recently changed the formula and it no longer works like it used to. I won't be buying again.
"
"
I opened this conditioner just past the return window date to find the conditioner smelled overwhelmingly like fake roses. It’s so strong I can not use it. This is obviously a knock off. Very disappointed
"
"
Worked well, but I didn't care for the smell at all. I returned and bought the DevaCare equivalent. The smell is wonderful and it works great!
"
"
I've got curly hair, and struggled to find the right conditioner.  Mine is more wavy.  I always rinse this out, and it leaves my hair soft, and with no flyaways.  I airdry, and use the deva curl anGel as well.
"
"
Devacurl products made my hair fall out in clumps.
"
"
This product has a different smell to it now. The reason I USE this product, is because I do NOT LIKE products that smell.  I'm very disappointed with this product.
"
"
I never felt so cheat on a product in my life !!  The conditioner was runny and watered down ! How could you sell your customers something like this ! I shop frequently on amazon until now ! This shopping experience on this product was horrible !Rshick
"
"
It's the only product that works!
"
"
Works great  - especially  when  I dry my hair  with  a diffuser! Has helped  my heat damaged  hair  reclaim  it's natural  curls.
"
"
I've been using Deva Curl products on my daughter who has very tight curls for years.  They are the best!
"
"
This is simply the best conditioner I have used.  I love the scent - it smells like incense.  It conditions my curly hair beautifully.
"
"
Finally a fantastic product for those of us with curly manes! No more searching for something claiming to help curls! This is the real deal!
"
"
I just started to use this bottle and it smells like wet leaves and is watered down. AVOID THIS VENDOR!
"
"
Great conditioner which does not weigh down fine hair.
"
"
This product works so well and makes my curls so soft and bouncy.
"
"
Wonderful product along with the other Deva products for taming wild, frizzy, naturally curly hair. I use it in the shower, and then sometimes I mix a little bit with water in the palm of my hand to smooth through my dry hair if I have frizzy hair. It's also a lot more affordable on amazon than at the beauty salon.
"
"
I think the one I got was watered down. I will now purchase in person from a local retailer.
"
"
best conditioner I have ever used!
"
"
Love this product! And it came with the pump dispenser at what appears to be no extra cost.
"
"
Love it, sorry I stopped using it for a while. Doesn't fade your color, dry your hair, or frizz your curls
"
"
This stuff works, but it is no where near worth the price of it.  My stylist recommended it to me, so I invested in the DevaCurl One LowPoo and condition.Whenever I try a new conditioner, I shampoo (this time, with LowPoo) and rinse, then I put the new one on half of my head, then my current one (in this case Pantene Pro-V for curly hair) on the other side.  I proceed for a few months.  After ""testing"" DevaCurl for 5-6 months, both my husband and I thought the Pantene side was softer and slightly better managed.  So, when this bottle finally ends, I will be back to my normal conditioner!
"
"
Love this product. When I received it in the mail the plastic wrap was not tight and the top had popped up so the conditioner was all over.
"
"
For a leave in conditioner, it works well, and smells nice.  Leaves hair soft but frizz is not under control, so have to use other products on top as well, which is to be expected.
"
"
my daughter has very difficult hair to manage.  the silkiness of this conditioner easy detangled her hair and cut prep time in half.
"
"
Horrible smell. Gave me a headache. Returned the product. Would not recommend
"
"
Excellent but dropped a star as too expensive for a household of curly people
"
"
I had doubts, but I love it! Conditioner has excellent slip and the smell is pleasant, not too strong. I use it more as a leave in conditioner followed by the Arc Angel. Best curls ever!
"
"
I love this product!
"
"
Creamy but need a lot if your hair is thick and wiry.
"
"
I switched to this product about 6 months ago, thanks to my hairdresser.  I love the scent, it's great for my curly, frizzy hair, and my color seems to last longer.
"
"
Love this stuff
"
"
The very best thing for curly hair! Even works great as a leave in!
"
"
The only conditioner I'll let near my curls.
"
"
I really like this conditioner. I don't rinse thoroughly as I like to leave some in to help with the frizzies.This is a good product for naturally curly, dry hair.
"
"
I am a curly girl and this is all I use.  Best conditioner on the market, undoubtedly.
"
"
I love this conditioner but unfortunately when I opened my package the conditioner was everywhere.
"
"
Love the conditioner, but the packaging didn't hold up to shipping. Somehow th bottle broke through the plastic bag and leaked conditioner in the box. But the conditioner is great for my curly hair.
"
"
Love this conditioner! Totally addicted.
"
"
It is sooo moisturizing.  Keeps my curls smooth and lovely.  I use it every day and even leave a little in for a little extra moisture.
"
"
I started using this after a botched salon visit that left me with fried hair and it helps tremendously! It smells good and my hair has never been softer
"
"
If you have curly hair, deva curl products are must haves!!

The product arrived opened, with condition all over the bottle.
"

Like the feeling you get after use and
"
"
Love this product! It leaves my curls in their natural curly state.  I also love that you can use this on dry hair as well.  I use this product more on my dry hair during washings that anything other styling product.  The smell is almost non-existent, coming from someone who does not have a good sense of smell.  It is worth the purchase.
"
"
A nice light conditioner
"
"
Love this product!!!
"
"
This stuff works really well.  I use it in conjunction with other Devacurl products and my hair has never looked better.
"
"
This is a great product.  I love how it goes in my hair and how easy it is to finger comb my hair with it.  I never fully rinse it out to help control my hair.  This is the first hair product I have found that works in my curly hair!!
"
"
Love the conditioner but bummed the cap was damaged during shipping and conditioner spilled out.  ☹️
"
"
Helps my dry hair - great for my curls.  No allergy problems--some hair products make my head itch, but not this one!
"
"
Deva curl is great. Leaves my hair feeling silky, does not weigh it down.
"
"
I use this even though I don't have color treated hair. It's thicker than the original One Condition so I feel that it moisturizes better. Plus I think it smells better.
"
"
This is my favorite conditioner! The smell is intoxicating and it has awesome slip!
"
"
Love this product.  Have been using for a while and it made the biggest difference in managing my curls.  Quick delivery. Very satisfied, except I wish it weren't so expensive.
"
"
I do not think this is the original product by Deva.It smells different and is less creamy than the original.I am sorely disappointed. I have compared it  toa sample I had bought directly from Deva.
"
"
I like what this conditioner does to my hair but it makes my back and neck breakout so I have stopped using it.
"
"
This helps me keep my curly, color treated hair happy.  Like the smell and texture a lot.  It is an OK value.  Price keeps going up though.
"
"
Ordered this product to have in stock at home and was incredibly disappointed when I opened it.  The product has been watered down and IS NOT authentic!
"
"
I use to hate my curls they were out of control and frizzy until I was introduced to the book Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey and her product line, this is the best product that has happened to my hair!
"
"
I ordered this for my lady friend. It was double bagged and the cap was taped down.  The last time an 1/8th of the product leaked out due to shipping wrap. Not this time. Thank You for improving the shipping wrapping.  As far the product goes? It does wonders to curly thick hair !
"
"
This is a great conditioner for curly hair - I've been using it for years and highly recommend it.  However, this product size (32 ounces) comes with a pump and unfortunately the pump doesn't work.  I've bought a few of these at this size and haven't had problems, but the last two both have defective pumps.  Nothing makes the morning more frustrating (ok, overstatement) than dealing with a faulty pump.  I recommend getting this and tranferring it to a smaller bottle or just buying the 16 oz size, which is manageable without a pump.
"
"
My wife loves this conditioner.
"
"
This is not the original Deva Curl product,  I've been using this product for over a year and this version is runny and does not have the same amount of detangler in it.  I compared it to another bottle I had and when you squirt out a bit in your hand it immeeaditaly becomes a flat puddle.  The real stuff holds its shape in a little pile in your hand (albeit liquid).
"
"
Absolute best
"
"
i've been using this conditioner for about 20 years! lorraine massey, founder of devachan & creator of this line of products, was my stylist when i lived in NYC, and she introduced me to these products. simply put: they WORK, super well. rich & creamy, but not heavy. smell great, too. and they don't contain icky ingredients (e.g., sulfates, etc.). i use this conditioner instead of shampoo, on a daily basis. can't live without it!
"
"
I'm a huge Deva Curl fan and Condition One is my go to product.
"
"
item arrived as described
"
"
Great product, not too heavy. Great price too!
"
"
Another repurchase....works well - still frizzy but works better than other products.
"
"
Leaves hair silky smooth.
"
"
I have coarse, curly hair and have tried pretty much every conditioner or oil out there to smooth the curls without making them heavy. This is easily the best conditioner I've found--and it helps keep my color from fading. I like the standard DevaCurl conditioner, too, but this one works even better for my hair. I can't imagine using anything else!
"
"
Bottle came busted and leaked everywhere.
"
"
I use this for a ""no-poo"" method of shampooing, less breakage, less hair loss, less frizz, more shine
"
"
This is my go-to conditioner! I have been using it for many years. I have tried others, but nothing does the trick like this one! Must buy!
"
"
Use it all the time.
"
"
Great stuff
"
"
THE BEST
"
"
Good basic conditioner for s'wavy hair.  Leaves hair soft, detangled and not frizzy, but never heavy or weighed down.
"
"
really holds the curl in, be careful not to use too much. nice smell, not too strong.
"
"
This is the best conditioner. I love its smell and how soft it makes my hair. It leaves my hair feeling great.
"
"
It's fake. Not real Deva Curl Product.
"
"
My hair is much too dry for this product. It didn't do anything.
"
"
I love what it does for my hair.
"
"
Love this, i have naturally curly hair that usually looks like i had an electric shock. This stuff is wonderful my curls now are normal no frizz and no standing up
"
"
While I like this product,  the bottle came damaged and leaking now the pump will not work
"
"
Smells wonderful and my hair loves it
"
"
My son had super curly hair and this product has helped us finally control them.  He has autism and this was easy to use and he is able to do it himself.  He loves that he can take care of his hair without mom fussing over him.
"
"
When I use this with Angel and No Poo, I feel like a different person.  It makes my curls so nice and yet really soft.  Well worth the money.
"
"
My brillo hair is soft and I can comb it!  I have medium length thick, colored and curly hair. I use this every day before I attempt to comb it.
"
"
Have used this for co-washing and conditioning (both regular and leave-in) for years now - swear by it!
"
"
Use this in the shower for your curly locks. Squeeze out the excess moisture and put another squirt or two in your hair. Leave it in to help keep those curls beautiful!
"
"
Sulfate free shampoos, botanical conditioners, alcohol free gels - make for healthy, happy and hydrated hair.  This stuff is amazing!
"
"
smells great, not heavy in my hair. I use it every day and as a leave in also.
"
"
Best conditioner for my curly hair I have found.  Scent is fresh and detangles and moisturizes with ease.  I leave in a little and my hair does not feel heavy or greasy.
"
"
I love Deva Curl One Condition and have been using it loyally for a year.  I wasn't going to be able to pick it up from my salon, and thought I'd try ordering it through Amazon.  The product I received was the consistency of Half and Half, not the conditioner I know and love.  Clearly, someone (seller: Zulera) is watering this down and selling it to unsuspecting curly girls.  Buyer beware!
"
"
See above.  This is a disappointment.
"
"
Would give it 5 stars if it would not leave me with an itchy scalp.That has been a problem with natural products for me.Why is that?
"
"
Great stuff
"
"
I use this after every shampoo and it not only prevents tangels butit smells good too. it is recommended to use with the loo-Poo or No-Poo shampoo
"
"
I gave it time but the results are the same. It makes my thick, coarse, curly hair soft BUT it appears so frizzy. Not the nice smooth tame curls I was hoping for. I won't be buying this again.
"
"
Love this product! Highly recommended!
"
"
Thank you! This is just as I would get it in the stores.
"
"
Large bottle, great product.  My daughter has very curly hair.  This works great for defining the curl without weighing it down!
"
"
it is not the real Deva Curl.
"
"
the jar was not closed well enough!! I ve got a mess!! you should wrap better!!
"
"
Love
"
"
Love this product for my curly hair. This is the only brand I do now.
"
"
I've been purchasing this conditioner for about 2 years now. I love that it doesn't weigh my (fine) hair down, and leaves it feeling great!
"
"
Love this stuff!
"
"
Great Product - but all their products are great - love having my curls back again!  What a great difference this makes!
"
"
I really like Devacurl products. I've stopped purchasing it, however; it's just too expensive.
"
"
I really like Devacurl products. I've stopped purchasing it, however; it's just too expensive.
"
"
I have medium curls and I have always loved this brand
"
"
Smooth, creamy, all in all a great conditioner.
"
"
Works amazingly on my biracial daughter's hair.  No other product comes close. I use it as a leave in as well.
"
"
I love this product for how wonderful it makes my hair feel and act. Thank you to Deva Curl for having the perfect conditioner
"
"
Got here fast, but the dispenser top was broken off. Might need better packing in the future.Good hair product for very curly hair.
"
"
love this conditioner
"
"
if you have curly hair you need this.  I struggled so long with unmanageable hair, and this was an answered prayer
"
"
Love it! It is not necessary to wash it out of your hair. Leaves your hair smooth,
"
"
As a guy who once buzzed his head because he didn't want to take care of longer wavy hair, I quickly changed my mind using this product.  I also use a dab after a shower when it's still wetas a low key styling creme.
"
"
If you have curly hair and have been searching for a great product line, Deva Curl is it. After years of keratin straightening, I am full on embracing my inner Shirley Temple. Deva Curl products are amazing. It starts with No Poo, which is a no foam shampoo. I follow it up with this great conditioner and some gel and/or styling cream. I let it air dry. What I get is a head full of curls that last all day with great definition and no frizz. Next morning I mist with water, hit my hair with a diffuser blow dryer for a few seconds, and boom. Good to go. Love this product line.This conditioner is a great deal. And who doesn't love a pump?
"
"
This product is great, but has multiple times arrived with the conditioner all over the bag it is packed in. I would not recommend purchasing from the seller.
"
"
This conditioner smells amazing and works beautifully in my hair. I do a diluted baking soda & vinegar rinse rather than using normal shampoo and then use a small amount of conditioner at the end. My hair stays clean and hydrated, and it smells so good!
"
"
I use as a leave-in conditioner and my hair doesn't get greasy.
"
"
Well packaged but it spilled a little.
"
"
Still deciding how much of the product line I need.
"
"
Detangles my hair and makes it soft.
"
"
Still learning how to use it for best results but I really love the brand and have used other products by this company for years  Very happy
"
"
I love this for my naturally curly, but fine hair. My young (3yo) daughter also uses it to keep her hair tangle free. This is a staple in our home!
"
"
I tried going back to the cheaper stuff, but I keep coming back to purchase this.  It makes my hair so easy to comb through.
"
"
Was skeptical at first but it actually works really well...will order more
"
"
Can't live without this stuff for my curly hair
"
"
Deva's One condition is wonderful for curls and a fabulous conditioner both for shower use and leave-in.
"
"
The only conditioner I use for curly days!
"
"
Love this stuff.
"
"
I've used it for a 3 to 4 yrs and love it.  The fragrance is nice too and I'm sensitive to fragrance.  I don't rinse it out all the way and it makes my dry curly hair soft and shiny.
"
"
LOVE IT! WORKS ON REALLY CURLY HAIR JUST WONDERFULLY. i WOULD TRY IT IF YOU HAVE DRY, CURLY OR FRIZZY HAIR
"
"
Was very happy with the conditioner, as I was with the shampoo or ""no poo"". It's pricey for me but hope to continue to buy it.
"
"
The only think I use on my hair now, I love the Deva products
"
"
Love it.  Same as at the beauty salon only cheaper.
"
"
Be aware! There are harmful chemicals in this product that will damage your hair! Especially if you have curly hair like me. This was my first time and will be my LAST time purchasing this product from AMAZON! Ever since I received this product, I was so excited to use it from all the good things I’ve heard about it and I won’t lie, I’ve never used a devacurl product prior to this but all my curly headed girlfriends have always said it’s the best. And I don’t doubt that it’s probably an amazing brand, but this particular product from this seller must be where the issue lies. It is definitely not authentic.So the first couple times I used the conditioner, I didn’t notice too much of a change. And then a couple weeks later, I began to itch my scalp A LOT. And my hair was falling out like crazy!!! At first, I never suspected it to be this product I bought but then I thought to myself, I have never had such itchy scalp before and I’ve also never seen that much hair come off my head while combing it. It freaked me out! This product smells like there’s bleach in it or bug spray. Don’t be cheap! If you really wanna stick to this brand conditioner, I suggest purchasing the actual thing for several dollars more at a beauty store and get your moneys worth while keeping your hair and scalp healthy. I’m just saying
"
"
I'm curly and it works pretty well for me
"
"
Survival of my children's hair requires this product!  Curly, nappy hair does not win when using this product. Combing is no longer a big deal.
"
"
I don't like this as much as I do the regular Deva no poo..It seemed to drying to my hair
"
"
This is the 3rd bottle of Deva Care One Condition I have ordered. The first two, purchased from other sellers, the conditioner was white, smelled good and conditioned really well inspite of a somewhat thin consistency. This conditioner that is supppose to be the same product is thick, yellow, smells bad and doen't condition at all. I also ordered the Low Poo from this seller and it's the same story, the product is a different color, smells different and my hair is dried out looking and feeling.
"
"
Love this stuff for my curly hair. Look up Deva Curl. So glad I found it and at a great price!
"
"
I like this stuff but wound up replacing it with Bamboo oil.
"
"
It does an amazing job on the curls I took a star off for the smell. It smells like hair relaxer to me
"
"
Great conditioner!  Use daily on my naturally curly hair.  Highly recommend.
"
"
love it, i only use this hair product on my curls since getting my haircut by devashan in soho nyc!
"
"
Love my Deva Curl
"
"
Love it! Helps to moisturize my dry hair.
"
"
everything is good
"
"
This stuff is awesome! I love the way it makes my hair look and feel.
"
"
I have been using this conditioner (along with No-Poo) for many years and I love the way it feels and smells.
"
"
I've been using this product for over a year. It leaves hair feeling soft and natural while controlling the curl and there's no frizz!
"
"
I love this stuff!!! I have been using Deva Curl No Poo and One Conditioner for the last 4 years, and my curls have never been better. It took me many years and bad hair days to find the right products to use, but one I found Deva Curl, I knew this was it.
"
"
I've tried many conditioners for my curly hair and nothing beats this stuff.  Love it and it smells good too!
"
"
It works pretty well but not any better than something you can buy cheaper at any local store.  Not happy with this product line at all.
"
"
This has been a staple in my hair routine for a while. It works great as a deep conditioner, leave in or styler. It hydrates, tames frizz, defines and clumps and slightly stretches my coily curls. It smells clean and fresh, like verbana. It's only down side for me is that it white balls with eco styler so I try not to overlap the two. However I highly recommend it.  I love it!
"
"
I received this item and it leaked out of the packaging.
"
"
Add this to low poo shampoo and you have a great duo for any type of hair, a must in my daily routine.
"
"
I've been using this for over a year on my naturally curly hair.  It's the best product out there. Smells great and leaves your hair soft and manageable.
"
"
I have used DevaCurl for years. This is DevaCurl.  Not much to rate. :-)  It works well for my natural 3C hair.
"
"
Excellent product in a great line
"
"
Works great on my hair.  I use it along with other devacurl products (mainly the styling foam)
"
"
Awesome product. I tried a lot of products and this products works well for me.
"
"
Absolutely love this shampoo. My hair is far less frizzy and holds its natural wave all day.
"
"
This product gave my frizzy shapeless ""bush-like"" hair on my head shiny spirals and I've finally embraced my ""wild"" hair for the first time in over 50 years!
"
"
I have been using this product for the past 6- 8 years. I love it. I f I am too busy do not have time to  wash completely u can leave in small amount on wet hair- it is never too heavy.- very good product.
"
"
The perfect curly-girl product.  Smells wonderful, too.
"
"
If you have curl crazy unmanageable hair try this and all of Deva Curl line, works good! get some today !
"
"
Love this product.  Seems to not weigh my hair down when I leave it in.  Smells great, keeps hair hydrated.
"
"
I have been using Nopoo for a year, great product and I can see the difference.
"
"
Great! Definitely buy again.
"
"
I love this conditioner. It is fantastic for curly hair. You can also use it as a leave-in conditioner, which is very convenient.
"
"
Its not the same as the one I got from my salon.
"
"
DevaCurl products have changed how my curly hair looks and how I feel about it.  Wish I have found these products decades ago.
"
"
I just love this stuff. Keeps my hair moisture and my curl bouncy and defined.
"
"
My daughter and I use nothing but Deva products.  Reading the book ""Curly Girl"" changed our lives.  We found a local hair stylist who cuts with the Deva approach (dry cut) and it has made a huge difference.  Learning all the do's and don'ts, using the right products, cutting our hair with this approach -- People have complimented me more on my curls in the past 3 years than the previous decades put together!  My daughter hated her curls no matter what we tried.  Now, she has gone almost 2 years without straightening her hair and loves the curls.  Looks like Brave! (cartoon character)
"
"
The only product for my curls
"
"
I've been using deva curl conditioner for the past 3 years and I would never think of changing! I received the correct product on time. (Only recommendation to the shipper is to ensure the bottle is tightly closed when shipping, some of the product came out in the package)
"
"
This product was fake - not the real Devacurl conditioner. Made my hair brittle, frizzy and damaged. Beware
"
"
Great product but the package came cracked
"
"
Great conditioner, my curly hair is loving it. Wish the price was a little lower so I could order more.
"
"
I love it. Leaves my hair soft and conditioned.
"
"
Deva Curl is the best thing in the world and this conditioner has changed my life. Cannot recommend this enough.
"
"
I really love this conditioner. I hope they never discontinue.
"
"
Gets rid of frizz
"
"
Great product, great seller!!
"
"
Not as rich and creamy as one would hope.
"
"
This conditioner made my skin break out the entire time I used it. I had beautiful curls during the day but my hair looked greasy by nighttime, even though I don't have oily hair. To combat the greasy, I wound up having to wash my hair daily even though my Deva stylist said I should only have to do so every 3-4 days. After a month or so of really giving the Deva system a try, I switched back to Aveda products. The whole shampoo/condition/style process was just too time consuming and for all the effort, it didn't make my hair look any better.
"
"
Great, light conditioner for curly/wavy, unmanageable hair.
"
"
The name should be changed from Ultra Creamy to Ultra Runny and Thin. I've been a faithful DevaCurl user for over 3 years now and have loved it until recently. The most recent bottle of OneConditioner I bought was much thinner than previous bottles of the OneConditioner I bought.  Additionally, I've noticed that I've needed to wash my hair more frequently (from once every 4-5 days to everyday or every other day), the product has been building up in my hair (I used Ultra Defining Gel), and my hair has been thinning by my hairline. It's hard to say whether it is from the OneConditioner, No Poo, or Ultra Defining Gel. I will be switching to a new product line, because I have been hearing similar things about the quality of their products going downhill. Such a shame, since I had thought I'd found a product that I would use for life. I tried to post a review to the DevaCurl website, but after I clicked ""Submit"" and went back to look for my review, there are only 5 star reviews there. Shady shady...
"
"
good for curly hair helps frizz
"
"
I have been using this product for almost two years and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!
"
"
I tried this product because it was said to be helpful for my dry, itchy scalp. I can't comment on the results of this product, because I will not be using it again! The smell of this product literally made me nauseous. The no-poo shampoo smells wonderful, but this has a very artificial scent that reminds me of my grandmothers bathroom spray!
"
"
Love this conditioner
"
"
I have curly/wavy hair, and my hair loves this stuff! I use it as a rinse out and a leave in.
"
"
Love everything
"
"
I love this product.  Does not way hair down and helps with frizz.
"
"
I highlight my hair, which makes it dryer than normal, and this conditioner works great for me. It keeps my hair smooth and hydrates it great. I leave this conditioner in like her book recommends for my corkscrew curls. I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time keeping their hair hydrated from coloring. It smells great too!
"
"
Best sulfate free conditioner and I have straight hair.
"
"
Curls looked beautiful not crunchy at all
"
"
This tames my long and nappy hair! Lol
"
"
I like the conditioner but it has come opened multiple times, about 1/2 the times ive ordered.
"
"
does wonders for my daughter's curly hair
"
"
Love! If I don’t use this my curls are not nearly as nice.
"
"
Never have any issues with Deva products.
"
"
I will always use this conditioner on my curly hair works great!
"
"
I love the whole product line, but the conditioner is probably my favorite! Great for curly hair, easy to use.
"
"
I really love this product, however the product i received is not what I'm used to.It doesn't smell the same and it doesn't soften/de-tangle/work in my hair the way it does when I buy it at the beauty salon.Buyer beware - you get what you pay for.
"
"
Absolutely love...do put a small amount in and don't wash out makes a big difference.
"
"
I had no idea what I was missing!  I have been using biolage detangling solution for  years.  I did not realize there was something better.  I have wavy, curly, easily ratted hair.  this is a great condition and i use an extra pump as a leave in conditioner.  It works great without leaving any residue.  My hair is so easy to pick through.... though I'm still learning about how to treat my hair and no poo is on the way now.  can't wait to try it.
"
"
I have not let shampoo touch my curls in over 7 years. This is my holy grail product and I wouldn't dream of using anything else. Everytime I tell someone that I don't use shampoo they have to touch my hair. I always get ""but it's so soft and shiny!"". I color my own hair and don't even use the conditioner that comes with it. I only use One Condition for my waist length curly hair. I can't imagine anyone not liking this product. Even my former hairdresser loved it and said it was better than what she was using. She even looked into carrying it in her salon. I go to the gym and sweat, swim in pools and rivers, blow dry my hair and color my hair regularly and you wouldn't know it by looking at my hair. This is the ONLY product you need!
"
"
I was working on growing out my hair and wanted a higher quality conditioner. This makes my hair feel soft, though it seemed to leave a waxy feel after the first few washings. The scent is a bit strong, but I enjoy it. However, if you are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to try something else.
"
"
Great product for those of us with naturally curly hair. I've been using this product for years and am very happy with it. Controls frizz and brings out the natural beauty of curly hair.
"
"
Love Deva curl.  My hair is soooo soft.
"
"
The product was too watery
"
"
!The first two weeks this shampoo was fantastic! .. my scalp always had a tingling sensation I thought was a good thing, by the third week my hair was falling out in clumps I would say i lost about 40 percent of volume I am devastated.
"
"
This product is awful, makes my hair knotty plus it has taken away my natural curls. Never have I been more disappointed with a product.
"
"
I love this conditioner!
"
"
No the original version. Does not leave my hair the same as the product that I bought at a salon.
"
"
I went to the Deva hair salon in Manhattan, and this was the easiest way for me to get more of their product without traveling. I have really long curly hair so I love the large size of the bottle.
"
"
I love the original conditioner.
"
"
just tried it for the first time so the jury's still out.
"
"
Can't do without it. Very defining for my curls
"
"
This is the best conditioner I have ever used for my curly hair.  It smells great, too!  Good value.
"
"
Muy bueno
"
"
I have been using the DeVa brand for 9 years now. Sometimes I attempt to try a different conditioner or product but ALWAYS come back to this brand.  I have fine curly hair (but a lot of it!).  This conditioner is the only one that doesn't weigh it down or make it greasy.  It smells great too!!
"
"
Great conditioner. Worth the price..
"
"
Great Product, great packaging for delivery
"
"
Love DevaCare products
"
"
I've been using this conditioner for a year or two now. I'm a white girl with thick, semi-coarse hair; wavy, big curls in the back, tight ringlets in the front. This conditioner makes all my curls increase in curliness, especially when used according to the Curly Girl directions (see the book or website). It has a slight orangey-citrus smell. I love this stuff--the only (very small!) downside is that I either need to run some thru my hair after rinsing or use another product to get my hair to its curly maximum.
"
"
Love this product and more importantly, so does my curly hair.  I use this daily.
"
"
Always good.
"
"
Item arrived in a reasonable time frame. Item was well priced. This is a good product.
"
"
Great for anyone with thick, curly hair!  Awesome product!
"
"
This product wasnt the one I had used before. It works okay but smells horrible.
"
"
Love it. Used with the other Deva products, my hair has never been healthier.
"
"
This is an awesome conditioner for curly hair.
"
"
Great slip and leaves hair shiny
"
"
Hydrates my super curly hair
"
"
this stuff is great!
"
"
I have tried many other store and salon products but nothing has worked for my curly hair like the Deva line of products.  In fact I used to straighten my hair every day until a friend recommended I try Deva Curl.  I use the One Condition Daily along with Deva Angel.  I wet my hair, apply One Conditoner, rinse and then apply Deva Angel, no more blow drying or straightning!
"
"
I love this conditioner.  I feel like my curls are less frizzy, and it smells great.
"
"
This conditioner may not weigh my hair down as much as another condition, so I may order it again.  It has a nice smell and texture.
"
"
Arrived safely and on time
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Love the product. My hairdresser recommended it. Smells good and keeps frizz away. Try it you will like it .
"
"
Made my curls super soft without being gummy or heavy! A must have for any naturally curly girl!!
"
"
I won't use any other shampoo and container on my frizzy curls....
"
"
good product for curls and reasonably priced
"
"
Yay!

This conditioner untangles without the need to comb, thus preventing breakage.  It feels great and keeps my hair healthy.  It helps to just blot hair dry using an old cotton t-shirt instead of a towel too.(no joke--read the Curly Hair book)
"
"
I absolutely love this product! I have medium thick curl hair that can easily tangle up. But this product allows me to easily detangle the curls in the shower. I used to need a comb in the shower to untangle the curls. Now I can just use my fingers to get all the curls out - and that is way better for my hair!
"
"
I have very curly hair and I love this shampoo.
"
"
great product line
"
"
Not a heavy duty conditioner that I was hoping for.
"
"
too heavy
"
"
The best products, styling and care advice for the curly headed.
"
"
Thr absolute best conditioner for curly hair. I'm in my fourties and have tried everything but nothing compares. I always come back to deva. My advice would be to leave some in your hair at all.times. don't rinse it all out. It's the perfect leave in.
"
"
Feels great on your hair
"
"
Cool.
"
"
Product is a fake. Does not smell like Deva Products, and is more drying than drugstore brands.
"
"
This isn't what I'm used to.  It smells completely different than the one condition I usually buy.
"
"
As you can see in the picture, the bottle was broken here. Before I even got to it.
"
"
BEST PRODUCT EVER for all hair types but esp. for wavy/curly hair.  Life changing.
"
"
Unfortunately, this product was watered down. It lasted half the time it normally does for me. Will have to try another seller.
"
"
The bottle is broken. Still wrapped in the plastic but you could clearly see it was leaking out of the bottle.
"
"
I love this conditioner! Its one of the best conditioners for my hair! Its very lightweight but surprisingly very moisturizing. It has great slip and it does an amazing job of detangling my hair.
"
"
I bought this product about 2 weeks ago.. It smells different and is thinner than the Deva Curl conditioner I bought from the salon. It is NOT the same product! I'm sorry I did not read more reviews before purchasing :(
"
"
Best conditioner EVER!
"
"
I was a little hesitant to buy this from Amazon, since another reviewer reported receiving a watered-down version. I am happy to say that this is the genuine product from DevaCurl that my curly hair loves! If you've used the Curly Girl method, you will be very pleased with this as a leave-in conditioner. The bottle comes with a pump for easy use. The package arrived fast and the bottle was shrink-wrapped from the DevaCurl factory.
"
"
I started using this conditioner a few months ago and love it.  I've struggled for years to get my hair to behave, and now that I use this conditioner my unruly waves have turned into pretty curls.  I get lots of compliments on my new hair.
"
"
I also use it as a leave-in conditioner. This big bottle is a great deal.
"
"
i travel for work and am away from home sometimes for four weeks at a time.  the travel size is too small, so this size is perfect.
"
"
It be great if my bottle wasn’t open upon receiving. Excited to try it though.
"
"
Great for naturally curly hair that tends to frizz
"
"
This is good stuff!
"
"
The only conditioner I use on my fussy curly hair.
"
"
Love it. Great buy.
"
"
RECEIVED AS PROMISED!
"
"
Consistently does a great job of taming my curls! I use in conjunction with diva curl gel and love it.
"
"
Excellent Product.
"
"
This product itself is good but product’s container was defective upon arrival.
"
"
Good.
"
"
I cannot recommend this product highly enough.  My daughter has super curly (yet fine) hair, and this conditioner helps keep it soft and less prone to tangling/matting.  It also smells amazing!
"
"
Excelent!
"
"
The bottle was completely damaged when it arrived. It leaked inside the packaging.
"
"
Love this product line. Makes my wild curls controlled, defined and soft. Curls still look nice after sleeping on them. That's never true with any other product.
"
"
No comment
"
"
Nice.  My curly hair loves this.
"
"
I love all the Deva Curl products.  This conditioner is silicone and sulfate free, and it works wonderfully for thick curly hair.  I use the Deva Curl ultra defining gel as well, and my hair stays soft and frizz free.  (Also it smells really good!)
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Best daily conditioner that I have used.
"
"
My daughter won't use anything else for her very long curly hair
"
"
This product is NOT the same as the DevaCurl One Condition I have used for years. It smells different, and the pump barely works. I'm not sure, but it seems like a knockoff. I would like my money back!
"
"
Deva Curl Ultra Creamy Daily Conditioner is the only conditioner I've found that doesn't way down my hair and actually conditions my dry frizzy hair.
"
"
I love this product and have used it daily for the past year
"
"
The product was opened and spilled within the individual plastic packaging when delivered!!
"
"
Exactly as described and super fast shipping - thank you!
"
"
Softens hair, but doesn’t take away the frizzies!
"
"
I don't like what it does to my hair. Seems to make my hair more dry and does not help the frizz at all...With this product the curls are not controlled as they should be.  (Edward is my husband and he ordered this for me...Carolyn Pettit)
"
"
The pump never works completely. You will end up unscrewing the top and dumping it into your hand. It is a dumb design.
"
"
Leave in a little after washing; helps control the frizzes! Great product for naturally curly hair!  The shampoo and gel are just as awesome!
"
"
This product is a great accompaniment to the Deva Low Poo shampoo.  It works well for fine and curly hair.
"
"
I have been using this product for about two years now. I like be the Deva Curl line. Perfect for He curly hair girl😊
"
"
I'm so glad I found this product.  It really helps condition my curly hair and it also smells great.  I would definitely recommend this to all curly girls.
"
"
Probably 1/5 of the product smeered inside the plastic casing - a little disappointed
"
"
Some product was squirted out of each product in package, but that was probably because some has to come out when you push the tops down & twist them to close them.
"
"
This conditioner and other Deva products have brought my hair back to life. I'm sold!
"
"
BEST HAIR PRODUCTS !!!
"
"
I love Deva Curl conditioner. What I received was not of the quality that I receive when buying Deva Curl products at the salon.
"
"
Works great on curly hair
"
"
It leaves my hair feeling extremely moisturized and gives me really good curl definition. I've also used it a couple of times as a deep conditioner and it works amazingly well. I would definitely repurchase this
"
"
The product itself was what I expected but I was disappointed to find that the pump did not work well. I ended up taking it out & squeezing the conditioner into my hands, which isn't easy with such a large bottle.
"
"
This One Condition conditioner softens hair after shampooing with deva no-poo.  This conditioner also smells a LOT better than the shampoo.  Good product within the deva curl system.
"
"
love it!
"
"
I liked this product because I can use it as basically an all-in-one - shampoo, conditioner and leave-in treatment.  The ingredient list is mostly oils so it gives you the soft curls and doesn't strip your hair of all the natural oils.  It also smells really nice too.
"
"
It feels thinner than the same product bought else where. Will buy somewhere else next time
"
"
I've used this for years and my hair still drinks it up like water. Paraben free and great value in this big size.
"
"
Best conditioner yet for my dry frizzy curly hair. Hairdresser even noticed a difference. Will continue to buy!
"
"
I love the shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair smooth and full of body.
"
"
Love their products for myself and children as we have curly hair and it's truly hard to find a good product that works ---this is it
"
"
MY wife uses this. ONly Conditioner she will use for her Naturally curly hair!
"
"
not usual product
"
"
(please refer to my before and after pics) I made the mistake of putting a keratin treatment on my hair about 8 weeks ago. What a disaster! I will never do that again. I was so miserable I wanted to cut all my hair off and start over, but my husband doesn't like my hair short so I was in a bit of a quandry: rat's nest, or divorce (well, he probably wouldn't have divorced me, but who wants their husband to hate their hair?). Then I found The Curly Girl's Handbook and Deva products and fell in love. My after pic is taken after using the method's described in the book and the Deva products (one conditioner, no poo shampoo, AnGel) for only 1 week! Nothing else will ever touch my hair again. Thank you, Lorainne Massey. You saved my curls, my marriage (haha), and my self-esteem.
"
"
Just the right weight for my hair.
"
"
Great product for curly hair
"
"
on time and original
"
"
Best curly girl conditioner. Hands down. And for a big bottle, I have to admit the price is totally worth it.
"
"
I absolutely love the Deva Curl line.  My curls have never looked this good and I've been using the product for 11 months.  The longer you faithfully use the product the less it takes to get your curls to respond.  I will NEVER go back to blow frying My God giving curls.
"
"
This is a miracle worker! My normally crazy and frizzy hair is now much more defined. I can let it dry naturally and not worry about putting any other product in it.
"
"
This is NOT Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner.  I have used it for years and this is a different color, smell and does not work the same.  Deva is usually an ecru color and this is white.  Both the shampoo and conditioner smell different than my originals.  The product does not work well at all.  I think this is a scam.
"
"
I only use this only as a mix-in with the heaven in hair as an overnight deep conditioner. Doesnt work for me as a daily conditioner....but my hair loves it for a weekly treatment.
"
"
The only thing that I like more than the Deva Curl Condtioner, shampoo, gel, & book is my fabulous hair stylist who is ""Deva Curl Certified."" If you use these products and follow the ""curly girl system, I HIGHLY recommend you find a stylist who can teach you how to use these products.
"
"
I use this for both my daughter and myself.  It actually really helps detangle her hair.  We love it.  Quality, ""clean"" and it works.
"
"
Best conditioner I ever used
"
"
Love this product!  Key is to not use too much and don't rinse it all out for my curls.
"
"
The pump did not work - always wrapped too tightly in plastic wrap.  So I have to save the pump from one I bought retail.
"
"
If you have naturally curly hair -this product works! It is worth every penny. Deva Curl products are truly wonderful for curly hair.
"
"
Love all the Deva Curl products.  They work so well on my naturally curly hair.  Only a tiny amount does the trick too!
"
"
My stylist advises me to shampoo with this product and was she right!!  Keeps the moisture in without weighing down the curls.  Will stick with this one.
"
"
I had very dry unmanageable hair. My hair dresser recommended the Deva Curl One cond. I could not beleive the difference in my hair. I believe this product is for curly hair but mine is blonde and very straight. I love this product. I would recommend to anyone.
"
"
I have really wavy/curly hair that gets frizzy without product. Deva curl conditioner makes my hair look and smell great. Plus it doesn't have bad ingredients.
"
"
Love this product it really works and makes your hair smooth, and managable.  My curls really look fresh and moist, not dry and frizzy.
"
"
Doesn't smell like the real thing I buy at Ulta.
"
"
I Love it.
"
"
I've been ordering this for a year or so wvry three months. Every time it arrives on time and only once did it leak a little in the box.
"
"
Always a winner....have used it for years.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl products (No Poo, One Condition, and AnGell) for about two years now and I love them.  They are the solution to my decade long quest to find great products for my curly hair, without harsh chemicals or silicone.  However, I am becoming inceasingly suspicious of the authenticity of this product from Amazon.  Other reviewers claim that this product is a fake... which got me thinking about whether I noticed any difference in the products I've bought from Amazon and the products I purchased from a salon.  Because I've been using the Amazon products for a long time now, I could only remember once when I thought the 32oz bottles of No Poo and One Condition from Amazon seemed different to me.  So, I am going to order products (including One Condition) from [...] -- the official Deva Curl and Deva Care online retailer -- and I plan on updating this review in a few weeks to tell you if I notice a difference.  Stay tuned![...]**On a side note, there is a difference between Deva Curl and Deva Care products. Deva CURL is designed for everyday use by women with unprocessed curly hair. Deva CARE is meant for processed or color treated curly hair.
"
"
Terrible. Smells so awful I can't keep it in the house. It makes eyes water, makes me cough and causes terribly itchiness on my scalp.  I've used Deva conditioner and never had this problem.
"
"
Great for my daughter's curly hair!
"
"
Try it
"
"
perfect for my curly girl!
"
"
I love it. It makes your hair so much easier to manage.
"
"
This is, bar none, the best conditioner out there  for curly girls! It leaves your hair so soft and frizz-free without any residue. I couldn't live without my DevaCurl products!
"
"
This is an absolute product for anyone who has curly hair.  I am so grateful that I was told about it.
"
"
Genuine Deva product, great price, but extremely slow shipping!
"
"
not exactly what I expected for the price, hoping to be happier as I use it.  Also, more expensive than I thought it should be
"
"
Since using the Deva curl products, I've had nothing but compliments on my hair. Quite a change from years of having frizzy hair that looked like a brillo pad:(
"
"
Love this conditioner! Highly recommend!Very creamy and rich. It leaves my curls very well defined.I don't recommend any other DevaCurl products due to leaving my hair very stiff/sticky.
"
"
Can not live without it
"
"
I am using the DevaCare No poo Cleanser with this conditioner! You can see my review there. I love the results I get with this conditioner. My only ""Complaint"" is the cost.
"
"
I'm a curly head, and have tried it all.This is one product that I've now stuck with for 3 years.Good stuff.
"
"
This is a good everyday conditioner for all hair types.  My hair is medium-fine and frizzy, and needs a little extra conditioning so I will occasionally leave this product in my hair up to an hour for additional moisture.  I like that it has a very light citrusy fragrance as I am in general averse to most odors/fragrances.
"
"
This is not Deva Curl! Horrible product compared to the real thing.
"
"
Ever since I began using this conditioner, I can get a comb through my hair easier and my curls are soft.
"
"
If you have curly hair I highly recommend all of the Deva Curl products.  They are fantastic and will make your curls frizz-free and bouncy :)
"
"
I love this conditioner! I have curly hair with highlights and this is great for my hair!
"
"
great product
"
"
Works great! I use it with PreZani! An  unbelievable combination!
"
"
I have dry curly hair.  I am over 50 and have my roots dyed about every 6 weeks so my hair really needs a good conditioner.  The product does not deliver what is promised, it feels like a cheap conditioner and my hair still feels dry after using it.  The fragrance is horrible, I cannot describe it because I've never smelled anything like it.  I threw it away after using it for a week just to give it a chance to work.
"
"
The only hair product that I use, mostly. No more shampoo. Less gel, too.Love Deva One Condition!
"
"
This is the best conditioner that I have ever used. I can't always buy it because of the price, but I try. It is worth every penny. I have fine 3b hair.
"
"
This stuff is the bomb!!! Absolutely love the way it makes my hair feel. So soft & silky. Delivered as promised.
"
"
Love this product! I have frizzy course curly hair and this works amazing to calm the frizz and help the individual curls!
"
"
The best condiditoner.
"
"
Works well for curly hair.
"
"
Wasnt the real formula, seems watered down and non moisturizing
"
"
Tames my unruly curls, love it!
"
"
No slip to this conditioner. My hair felt rough and dry after use. I must say that that the smell of this product terrific. Too expensive to be soo disappointing
"
"
Great product
"
"
this is one of the first products that has helped me to finally love my hair.  i love the no poo shampoo as well
"
"
I have fine curly hair and this is a wonderful product at a good price.  love the entire deva line.
"
"
I was told by my hairdresser that you can use a little to freshen up your hair. I mix with water in an old spraybottle and it works well. Also you can not rinse it out all the way on the ends when you need more conditioning. The smell isn't as great as before I think. And it almost seems a tiny bit greasy up top but I just avoid putting too much on.
"
"
I was very disappointed the larger bottle was very thin and not as creamy as the small bottle. I bought 2 large bottles and I'm using 4times the amount and I still don't get the same results.
"
"
Deva curl is the best. If you had to pick just one hair product....choose THIS!  I love the pump. It makes things much easier.  Fast ship great product!
"
"
Product was perfect but the pumper was not secure and quite a bit was pumped out and all over the bag when I opened the package.
"
"
This is a wonderful product. Leaves your hair soft and manageable. A little goes a long way so this bottle will last months. Great price on Amazon.
"
"
I've been buying this regularly for curly hair--and have stopped using shampoo. I go swimming quite a bit, and this keeps my hair soft.
"
"
My teenage daughter has extremely curly hair and has much healthier looking and feeling hair since using DevaCurl products. Highly recommend trying it.
"
"
love it
"
"
I love devacurl products! This one conditioner does not dry out my curls. It lasts long and looks really good!
"
"
This stuff smells a bit like pet shampoo to me, but it's easily dealt with. I am not sure if this conditioner is fantastic on its own, but it's a great combo with the Diva Curl Shampoos. However, I am not sure the price is worth it.
"
"
i like it a lot, smells nice and fresh, only need small amount, would definately recommend it for just about anyone with curly hair
"
"
I use this every day. Three times as much as buying in salon for same price. Love it.
"
"
Love this stuff. It always leaves my hair feeling moisturized but not sticky or heavy. Smells good too!
"
"
:)
"
"
Left my hair very dry.  Will not purchase again.
"
"
I use this between shampoos as well, I just wet my hair and work it in to my hair and then rinse it out  and off I go, leaves my curls well defined and soft as all get out!I use with Set It Free and it works so well.I highly recommend!
"
"
I have fine, curly hair and this product works great for me.  Nice fragrance too!
"
"
I would purchase again from this vendor at the same price.  I'd love to find other curly conditioners that work well (or better)
"
"
Fast shipping and great product!
"
"
love it
"
"
Wonderful light conditioner..perfect for soft curls
"
"
Beware of this seller. This is NOT the right product. It smells like sunblock or really cheap condition. NOT Deva Curl.
"
"
Curly hair loves this stuff.
"
"
My curls love this stuff!
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
I love this conditioner. I have super dry curly hair and One Condition leaves it silky and smooth. I follow the DevaCurl routine with ArcAngel after (and I haven't shampooed for 4 years).
"
"
I prefer the regular conditioner to this one which seems to feel like it holds moisture better.
"
"
not as concentrated as smaller bottle, most likely diluted with water.
"
"
New formula and I hate the smell. But it still works ok on my hair. Not nearly as great as the original.
"
"
Only product that works with my hair. Try changing for less money, always end up going back.
"
"
Love it, detangles and it keeps my hair manageable
"
"
I love devacurl products and this works great with highlighted hair! Also the lack of wheat and oats makes it closer to gluten-free.
"
"
great productgood pricetimely deliveryI'm always on the prowl for a good product for my curls, I discovered this at the deva salon in NY.  Now it is all I use
"
"
Love it! so happy I bought it and received it quick!
"
"
I like this product ok. Doesn't make my hair as soft as the Deva Poo conditioner and I only bought this because I couldn't find the other.
"
"
compared to the one conditioner I don't like this at all. I don't like the smell and it does not leave my hair well hydrated like the other product. not getting this again. sticking with the one conditioner, that's my go to product.
"
"
Don't waste your money not real deva curl product
"
"
Product does not look or smell like product from salon.
"
"
Great product at a great price!
"
"
This product neither smells nor has the texture of the one I purchased 1 month ago at the Devachan salon.  I believe this is a knock off
"
"
I was introduced DevaCurl by professionals in New York in 2008 and I've been using it since that time and I enjoy it!I am thanlful to a quick delivery of the product and a good price.
"
"
Great product
"
"
A great product! If you have curly hair, there's nothing as good as that on the market!
"
"
I have very curly hair and live in Florida with lots of humidity. This is a great conditioner.
"
"
I luv Deva Curl products! It makes my hair more manageable and it smells good as well.  It does take longer to use when cleansing your hair but it is worth it in the end.
"
"
I'm a deva product girl so I love there products. Works great for all kinds of curls hair.
"
"
This stuff dried out my hair
"
"
I have been using this product for years and it has so improved the condition of my thin fragile hair.  My hair is now getting thicker and not breaking.  FANTASTIC!
"
"
I've used Devacurl on several occasions and will purchase again.  I have recommended to friends and family. Wow great product
"
"

"
"
This is not the salon authorized DevaCurl One Condition! It smells like lemon!
"
"
Great product.. Use it all the time.
"
"
I love this product.  It makes a great daily conditioner,  as well as leave in treatment.
"
"
Seemed watered down. Very disappointed.
"
"
Bought this for my daughter who has curly hair that can turn into a rats nest in the blink of an eye. I have used it on her hair as a 'co' wash, and as a leave in de-tangler. Both was are great! Not too heavy or greasy, smells wonderful, I think I'm going to have to get it by the gallon! Great product.
"
"
I get compliments all the time when I use this conditioner. I use it also as a leave-in treatment for all day.
"
"
I don't believe this is genuine Devachan product.
"
"
Great product, great price, received it right away. Will definitely order again!
"
"
So disappointed!  I have been using DevaCare for years and loved it. Now I find out that they discontinued that line.  I bought this hoping it was a good substitute.  Instead my hair feels dirty and my scalp itches.  Back to the endless search for great curly hair products.  I was so happy with the DevaCare.
"
"
I Absolutely love these deva curl products,,,,,awesome!!!!! My hair is so soft, no tangles, no pick to use.... Woohoo woohoo
"
"
Did not like it!!!
"
"
It was Devacurl but was not the ""original"" type as pictured
"
"
CURLIES! DO NOT LET THIS BE YOUR JUDGE OF DEVACURL. SPEND THE EXTRA 5 AND ORDER FROM THE LEGITIMATE WEBSITE. This product seems tampered with.My hair LOVES one-condition. I purchased a sample pack and then a 32 ounce one-condition from the devacurl website. The conditioner I purchased was creamy and had a light, flowery smell. It made my hair buttery soft and smooth as silk when I came out of the shower.I am a college student and I recieve free shipping from Amazon, so when I noticed the site offered 32oz One-conditions for a reduced price, I was excited to do all my subsequent purchases from Amazon. However, the conditioner I recieved from Amazon was not quite as creamy, or flowery as the usual conditioner and had a thinner, watery feel. In the past, a single pump went a long way. With this bottle I find myself running out of conditioner a lot faster, as I need 4-5 pumps to get the same results. I cannot say for sure, but I am 95%positive this is NOT THE ORIGINAL ONE-CONDITION and that it has a higher water content. Shame on the people trying to make an extra dollar by diluting an amazing product. I will be ordering from the devacurl site from now on. 3 stars because the conditioner still works fairly well.
"
"
Devacurl products have been a lifesaver for my long, curly and super unmanageable hair. The One Condition Conditioner is the only product that not only detangles but conditions my coarse ends without leaving my hair oily or heavy feeling. My curls are much more healthy, bouncy and vibrant as a result of using the Devacurl products but to me, this item is the most irreplaceable and is worth the cost here on Amazon versus in the salon.
"
"
My wife will not use another conditioner.  she is very happy with the results.  She has been using it for 2 years.
"
"
Love this product. And what a great price!
"
"
The best conditioner for my curly hair.
"
"
Be sure to check reviews on sellers. I bought this from BeautyAnd, and was disappointed with the purchase. The product arrived on time, but smelled a little off. The more I use it, the more I think they filled it with mayonnaise or some other filler. It smells a bit rotten and I can't use it anymore. I've only used about 1/4 of the product and now can't return it. When I purchased from a salon, I found this to be a great product and would have given it 5 stars.
"
"
I have tried this and also the decadence. This conditioner smells like the lemon/citrus you would smell in a public bathroom. It was ok for the moisture. I prefer the other conditioners in this line.
"
"
I have been a faithful Deva customer for over a year and this product is awful!  It clumps into my hair and look like dandruff or bugs.  I am certain that this product has been tampered with and I will never order from them again.  Fnd a Deva salon or order from the site.
"
"
This product also smells fantastic.  In addition, it works.  It leaves your hair soft, untangled, and manageable!  I love it!!!
"
"
Awesome buy! Fast delivery! Great deal!!
"
"
I use this product religiously.  While I wish it wasn't so expensive (college budget is limited) the product does wonder for my hair.
"
"
Wonderful! Product! Highly recommend for anyone who wants a product of excellent quality! Thank you so much! Good Job! Congratulations!
"
"
Love this conditioner! It provides my hair with so much moisture and allows for a well defined curl.  Definitely recommend for curly hair!
"
"
I leave it in for extra conditioning and it totally prevents frizzies even in humidity!
"
"
Damaged when shipped...Besides that I live by this stuff.
"
"
GREAT PRODUCT !!!!
"
"
Amazing product! Highly recommended for anyone with curly hair.
"
"
Most hydrating products I have ever found for really curly hair.
"
"
Devacurl is the absolute best and always makes me look amazing! It is so moisturizing but I would recommend this only for people with curly and not super coily  because it is not very heavy!
"
"
What is this magic?! I've just used this for the first time and I can't stop staring at my hair. It's never looked this good. Ever. I think I have 2c/3a hair and I've never seen my hair curl so hard before. It's seriously amazing. I've just started trying to embrace my natural hair instead of hiding it and this stuff gives me hope. For real. It doesn't make my hair crunchy and it gives them some bounce. My hair usually gets fluffy after a while but not with this stuff. Nope. It's still going strong. Also, the smell is freaking amazing! I'm not a huge fan of coconut smells but this isn't like in your face coconut. It's like a summery coconut smell? It's good. Trust me.
"
"
I had been blow drying and straightening my hair for years, thinking I had weird waves that would never look good, until a friend had me try her devacurl, after wide tooth combing my hair, and then letting it air dry, and voila, pretty curls! The next day I bought this and couldn't be happier! It has made me love my prior frizzy now lovely waves and curls! And it smells great and doesn't leave a gross residue on your hands after application, I don't even rinse it off, it's like lotion as well! Best of all it has allowed me to sleep in a bit longer in the AM bc I just shower, throw this in my hair and go! Yay for low maintenance pretty hair! Plus I'm not ruining it with heat everyday anymore. Highly recommend!

I cannot say enough good things about this product! It technically isn't for my hair type (2B/C), so I use a lot less than my friends with curlier/more hair. I have fine hair, and a lot of it, but I still have the wavy/curly texture...it's a very fun mix to have. It prevents my hair from frizzing and keeps my curls going for days. I don't have to do nearly as much to my hair to revive it on days 2, 3, or 4 as I used to. I use a tiny pea sized amount, mixed with a little squirt of the Ultra Defining Gel, and some water, to perk my hair up after taking it out of my nightly pineapple. I can now do this instead of wetting or spraying my hair, re-scrunching, and adding diluted coconut oil to my hair. It keeps curls clumped nicely and works very well with the Ultra Defining gel. I've actually started using less of the UD gel and can get away with just this product. I tend to have some fuzzies/fluffies/frizzies/fly aways without the UD gel (which I've been using for almost four years without fail), but this product has changed that a bit. A word to the wise, especially those with fine or wavier hair, buy a trial size first to learn more about how it works for you. That's what I did, and it lasted me almost a month. After I ran out, I ordered the big girl version and I'll definitely reorder in a while when I run out!PS: It smells delightful!

I also received a bottle with the cap off. No way to pump it. Will have to scoop out but wonder what this stuff actually is. Possibly ruining my hair. Amazon needs to stop this seller they are crooks.

This is the first time I'm using the super cream. I originally used styling cream, and it did not work for my hair at all. I was a little skeptical that it would dry out my hair and make it look flat, which is a big no for someone with thin curly hair. But this one worked! My curls flourished after one use! They look so healthy and moisturized, and they got back their spring and volume. This works amazing with the light defining styling gel! And it smells amazing and doesn't feel to heavy on my hair. 10/10 recommend this combo, especially if you have thin curly hair.****************************************************************************************************I think I got a dud. Smells nothing like the first super cream I ordered back in January. The coconut smell isn't there, in fact it has a faint smell of styling cream mixed with something else. Left my hair dry and brittle, no volume or spring. Not even with the styling gel. This vendor is very hit or miss and unfortunately this time was a major miss.

The product says it provides hold, definition and , moisture. I don’t know how but it literally does all 3 amazingly!!! This is the holy grail. I’ve been natural for over 10 years and have yet to find a product for wash and gos that I really had good results with until now ! I’m amazed at how good it is. I have 3c/4a hair . I wish I tried this years ago. And it works great on wet or dry hair . I prefer wet. LOVE IT! My new go to!

Girls with curls this product is for you! I have been dying to try the SuperCream for quite some time so I finally gave in and did. I regret not buying it sooner because this product helped my hair so much! It gave my curls, the definition they were crying out for. I have type 3A curls that can have a mind of their own and my arsenal of products has helped but this alone gave me a 0-100 result in the first 2 days of using the product. My hair has never looked better and now I have people coming up to me asking what I'm using because they need an added boost. If your curls are looking for curl definition, then this is for you!
"
"
I didn't wanna like this so bad cause it's kind of expensive, but I've tried SO many curly hair products and this one is seriously the best curl cream. It leaves your hair shiny, soft, and defined all at the same time and idk how. And for everybody saying it makes your hair frizzy... on its own your hair will get like that but pair it with any gel and LET ME TELL YOU it is bomb.

Should have known better Deva Curl is always full price! Didn’t realize until I purchased another one at an authorized retailer and the difference was undeniable. BUYER BEWARE

This product (filled by truemark) is a fake- it's packaged like supercream but is 100% not. It dried out my hair and smells like faint coconut and alcohol. DO NOT BUY IT FROM THIS SELLER! Spend the regular 23 dollars that supercream costs and save your hair and the 14 dollars that you would have spent on this, just to throw it away. They will not let you return it.
"
"
What is this magic?! I've just used this for the first time and I can't stop staring at my hair. It's never looked this good. Ever. I think I have 2c/3a hair and I've never seen my hair curl so hard before. It's seriously amazing. I've just started trying to embrace my natural hair instead of hiding it and this stuff gives me hope. For real. It doesn't make my hair crunchy and it gives them some bounce. My hair usually gets fluffy after a while but not with this stuff. Nope. It's still going strong. Also, the smell is freaking amazing! I'm not a huge fan of coconut smells but this isn't like in your face coconut. It's like a summery coconut smell? It's good. Trust me.
"

I had been blow drying and straightening my hair for years, thinking I had weird waves that would never look good, until a friend had me try her devacurl, after wide tooth combing my hair, and then letting it air dry, and voila, pretty curls! The next day I bought this and couldn't be happier! It has made me love my prior frizzy now lovely waves and curls! And it smells great and doesn't leave a gross residue on your hands after application, I don't even rinse it off, it's like lotion as well! Best of all it has allowed me to sleep in a bit longer in the AM bc I just shower, throw this in my hair and go! Yay for low maintenance pretty hair! Plus I'm not ruining it with heat everyday anymore. Highly recommend!

I LOVE this cream. I used to use it as the last product on my dry hair, but I’ve recently started using it as the first product on my soaking-wet hair and WOW! More definition and soft curls. I was a little concerned that I’d received an old product because there was a sticker with a bar code on the side that clearly belonged to Amazon, but since I didn’t notice any diminished performance, I wrote it off as being a part of their inventory tracking. Curly girls, get this product. It’s so much more expensive in salons, so just try it! At this price, it’s too cheap to have anything to lose.
"
"
This didn't work for me.  I have fine wavy hair and this was recommend to me by my hairdresser.  She said she loved it on her curls.  It made her curls look great.  She has nice S defined curls.  For my hair it just weighed it down and looked dull.  I thought it would help control the frizziness of my waves but it doesn't help with that at all.  I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with hair like mine.
"
"
Must have for 3b/c Curls!!!  I use this product along with other Deva Curl products to give me full controlled perfect curls!  I use in the following way:Deva Curl Product Order:1.  Deva Curl Shampoo and Conditioner (every other day) co-wash with conditioner only if necessary (listen to your curls)2.  B'Leave-in Curl Plumper3.  Frizz Free Volumizing Foam4.  Super Cream or Styling Cream (Define and Control)5.  Arc Angel Gel6.  Diffuser on low/cool heatWorth the investment!  I have long hair and it lasts forever!  Watch YouTube videos to see how it should be applied!
"
"
This stuff is like crack in a bottle...it's awesome! Since I got a Deva cut and started using Deva Curl products I've noticed a tremendous difference in my hair, but the Supercream Coconut Cream Curl Styler is the best and my curls look great. I now have my staple go to products for my weekly wash session. I don't just recommend this product....I implore you to purchase it and see for yourself.
"
"
Love my Deva curl Supercream coconut because let my curls super soft and define plus a lot of volume. Love the smell too. I'm very happy with my purchase and this is my second time purchasing this product . 👍🏽👍🏽
"
"
If you have curly hair don’t hesitate to buy this... I have very curly frizzy damaged hair that I have just now started taking care of about a year ago.. devacurl has been a staple in my regimen it is very lightweight and leaves my hair beautiful and rejuvenated!!! I have never had more compliments in my life. All I do is shower and apply generous amounts of product mostly to my ends and I have bouncy curls that don’t harden like typical mouse! My boyfriend loves my curls and even prompts me to buy more devacurl when I run out because he loves it so much. Click buy right now you won’t regret it.

Oh man, if you have curly hair then you know the struggle to find a hair product that can actually tame your curls and frizz without drying your hair or making your curls ""crunchy"". I've been trying out different products to find the perfect one, and I've finally found my solution with DevaCurl!My curls come out so perfect and even. My hair doesn't look like I just got out of a shower all day. My hair is soft to the touch. Its even conditioned my hair so well that even when I don't have product in my hair, the frizz level is down like 75% and so soft!!I know all curly hair is different, but if you've had problems in the past, I recommend checking out this product. Its worked wonders for me!The smell is also nice, kind of coconut like I guess. I guess the smell is maybe the one area left to be desired, but I can't complain. Has a nice scent that isn't too overwhelming.

I would just like to say, I started using this about a year and a half ago and really loved it for my curls.. I am of the age I have just started to go get my roots colored.. My head was itching constantly and my hair was coming out in quite large amounts which is not normal for me at all.. I chalked it up to having to color the roots, my hair stylist said in no way should the color be doing that.. I also noted my scalp burned when getting colored.. so constant itchy scalp, hair falling out, breaking hair, limp curls hair becoming scragglier. I went to order my hair products 2 months ago and they were out of deva curl cream so I bought a different brand..  welll just the other day two months later I realized omg my head doesn’t itch anymore and my hair isn’t falling out, and the root color didn’t burn at all..still didn’t attribute it to deva curl until I saw an article on it causing this for millions of women and it all clicked, wow very scary! Needless to say it’s all gone now I still use all my regular products minus the deva curl I thought I loved.. To the company you really really need to figure out what is causing this and pull your products from the market until you do, as we women love our hair and it means everything to us and we all supported you by buying and loving your products, please respect us in return and honestly figure what is causing this to happen, fix the problem and then bring your products back when the are heathy for us curly haired girls..

I have long, fine and curly hair. I tried the DevaCurl gel and this cream...both made my hair super dry and frizzy. Not sure why this works for so many others but for me, it was terrible. One day, hopefully I will find the miracle product for my hair! Oh and I can't return this...wish I would have known that or I would have purchased from another seller. Bummer!
"
"
Mine came busted. What a waste of money and I can't even send it back!!
"
"
Love this product and have ordered before but this time it was delivered completely destroyed and no means to return or write to ahipper
"
"
UPDATE: once I was able to clean off and reassemble, I tried this on my wet combination curl hair. It smells great and doesn’t leave my hair crunchy or frizzy. Not out of this world amazing, but did do a good job at defining my curls.May update product later after I actually use it. For now, 1 Star because this is how I received it.
"
"
I have thick, curly hair and this product gives me the right amount of support for my curls.  So many other ""curl"" creams are just too light to give me the hold I need.  Than there are the creams or gels that just make my hair crunchy and stiff.  This is the best one I've found in years.
"
"
I like it better than the older versions of the Deva Curl products. They had way too much fragrance. This one has a very nice smell that isn't overpowering. For my hair, it is just as good as much cheaper products. Also, the person who recommended it to me said that they just needed a tiny little bit to work, but I usually need about two pumps for my hair not to be frizzy - and I only have shoulder length hair. I won't buy again.UPDATE: I changed my hair and now it is much shorter. Since changing to a new style, I like the product better. I wouldn't say it is miraculous like some of the reviews but it is pretty nice. The only thing I don't like that I just noticed is that the price is much more now than when I first purchased it. With my new style I think I would purchase again, even with the higher price because it does last quite a while.
"
"
I got this for my curly/ wavy hair thinking it’ll help with the frizz and it just doesn’t do a great job. It’s been humid and hot past few weeks and after I apply this to my hair and by the end of the day it’s frizzy and not only that has a weird texture. It’s gross. Even when I don’t put anything in it and my hair frizzed up at least it’s soft and I can run my fingers through it. This makes it feel very sticky and nasty. Although I will say it’s a great substitution to hair gel. When I tie my hair up I can use this to flatten out little fly-away hairs. Definitely have to wash it out cause the texture is too sticky.
"
"
When reviewing hair products, the most important thing is to specify your hair type. I have curly, for real curly not scrunched, 2c & 3A curls. My hairs is Caucasian and it is not thin but fine, postpartum hair. I also have low porosity hair. This product just weight my hair down so much. My curls were dead. It went back.
"
"
First off, i love this product!! It leaves my hair frizz free and silky. When I first started using it, it weighed down my hair. My problem was i was putting too much when I only needed a tad bit since my hair is wavy. Now my sister's hair is really curly, and she has to use a bit more since it won't be affective if she uses too little. I have been using this for a couple a months now and it has made a drastic change in my hair. My hair felt dead before I bought this product, but after applying a bit every time I wet my hair, my hair now feels completely silky:))
"
"
The product itself is wonderful, however when opening the package after delivery it the top of the bottle was broken off and spilled all over inside the plastic bag it was in. I had to transfer the cream into a different product bottle that was empty. I’ve read in different reviews of this being a issue as well. Given I paid $15, I would like to be able to use all of it and not 80% of it.
"
"
When I opened the package the product was sealed in a plastic bag and when I went to remove the cap the whole top came off - I love the smell and feel of the cream but I can not use the dispenser.  I was so disappointed and this may have happened during shipping because the product wan only in a folded cardboard mailer.  :(  I hope someone can help me with this issue.  I have added a picture for your review.  Thanks Tonya Sexton

I have tried everything on the drug store and salon shelves to tame the frizzy curls. Just threw out all that ‘otc’ crap and am now hooked on this wonderful curl tamer! I like being able to run my fingers through my hair and not create frizz or run into crunchiness. It really doesn’t take much, so don’t be intimidated by the size of the bottle. My gf turned me onto the shampoo and conditioner back in January after I answered the door after a shower with fresh dry hair. I looked like  a clown. Add this stuff and my hair is FINALLY soft and totally tamed. Oh, and it smells like coconut heaven lol!
"
"
This is the best product I've used for my curly hair--it's low-cost and lasts for a long time. I have average thickness hair cut in layers down to my shoulder blades and use one pump. It doesn't make my hair take forever to dry and the more I use it, the better it looks! Believe me, I've used them all--including a long stint with Aveda's Be Curly--and this is the best of them. If I had more money, I'd use the whole line of products for shampoo and conditioner, etc.
"
"
I absolutely LOVE this product, it moisturizers my hair and keeps frizz at a minimum. I would even go as far as saying that it is the BEST leave in product I’ve encountered so far on my Curly Girl journey. But this packaging? Horrible! I have to tap and shake the bottle for five minutes before a small amount of product shoots out. I need a lot of it to make my hair work, and I’m going to end up taking the bottle apart and putting the product in a travel size container to be able to use it easily.
"
"
I absolutely love this stuff! I have tried a ton of hair products for my 2c hair. It’s thick and coarse, can be frizzy and unruly. This stuff tames it! My hair is softer, less frizzy and it doesn’t leave any residue or buildup. The scent is a nice light coconut smell. I don’t see much difference regarding the length of time it takes to dry. But I wasn’t expecting much in that respect. A little does go a long way but even when I’ve used “too much” its not even that bad. It actually seems to help with humidity protection when use too much!
"
"
I received this yesterday and went to use it today.  Guess what?  The dispenser doesn't work so I have no way of even trying product.  I can't return it because I went to return it today and it says item in unreturnable.  How is a defective item I receive my fault?!  Also I see no way of contacting seller.  I read on some of the reviews negative things about this seller.  True or not I cannot say, but I will never buy from this seller again.  So guess whose out the money....me!
"
"
I have used this Deva Curl product for years and what I received WAS NOT Deva Curl. The reviews questioning the authenticity of this product (the tops completely off) are valid questions. The color and consistency don’t match Deva Curl. The smell is similar but off, it looks like the product was mixed with another. I have some DevaCurl I bought retail and I did a side by side comparison. Definitely different. Just a warning to other buyers.
"
"
This cams busted up in the packaging- the top part was disconnected from the bottle and I couldn’t get it to stay on in order to use the pump- so I just take the top off like it’s a lid and still use the product without the pump. I am giving it 4 stars though because the product is so good! I absolutely love the devacurl super cream as well as their other products!
"
"
Smells amazing and defines curls well! I would have continued to buy this product repeatedly - but recently shaved my head. All curly girls - this one's for you! Seriously the scent is like Skittles and candy! I lived being around myself LOL. Curly girlies rejoice!
"
"
AMAZING! As a Caucasian woman With very curly brown hair I have searched for what feels like decades for a product that would both moisturize my hair and provide a healthy loss. This product is lightweight and moisturizing without being greasy like coconut oil on its own. You can put it on when your hair is wet so it dries off and a nice pearl or you can put it on as an afte with very curly brown hair I have searched for what feels like decades for a product that would both moisturize my hair and provide a healthy glass. This product is lightweight and moisturizing without being greasy like coconut oil on its own. You can put it on when your hair is wet so it dries off in a nice curl or you can put it on as a finishing product.
"
"
I have been battling my wavy hair for years and finally found this product.. it's amazing! A little more pricy than I'd like, but some of the products that didn't work were much more expensive so I consider it money well spent. I don't use any of the other products in this line, but would definately consider giving them a try after the success I've had with this one!
"
"
I am completly disappointed by this product. Let me be clear, my hair is naturally curly and is like a 3b. But i also have fine hair so it can be a bit difficult to find products that won't weigh it down and still give it a nice no frizz hold. And i really wanted to love this product so I tried to air dry my hair and I also diffused, but nothing. It didn't do anything different for my hair than other products that are 3x cheaper. It gave it some volume after diffusing but by the end of the night was a horrible mess and don't even think about second day curls. I woke up the next day looking like I hadnt brushed my hair the night before :( SUPER BUMMED, the search continues for a good curly hair product.
"
"
I’m giving this 1 star do to the fact it came oppened and most of the product is all over the inside of the box. This stuff is very pricy, what a waste:(
"
"
Devacurl Supercream weighs my 3A curls down. The only thing I could use this for is a straightening product, except I can’t tolerate the scent. It is so heavily scented, I was sneezing within 10 minutes. I don’t like heavy scents. I’d rather wear my nice perfume that I am not allergic to. This product also made my scalp itch. My curls were completely wiped out and my hair looked oily and unwashed. I used about 3/4 teaspoon in my thickish medium length hair. Very heavy on the hair. This one is probably good if your hair needs to be relaxed. Not for me. I need lift and bounce. Bummed after all the hype about it. It does put a lot of moisture in your hair if you like that. It took me 3 times longer to diffuse and I still couldn’t get all the way dry. I’m trying to think of someone I can give it to. Glad I didn’t pay full price at Ulta.
"
"
I love how the Supercream enhances my naturally wavy-curls. It defines them without adding extra ""gunk"". My hair is still soft to the touch and the frizz is kept at bay. The coconut smell is not overpowering. My husband despises coconut anything and has yet to complain about the scent of Deva Curl.I ordered with Prime delivery but the guaranteed date was a week later. I was pleasantly surprised when the cream came within 3 days.
"
"
I already use deva curl shampoo, conditioner, gel and now I add this to my gel while in shower.  since letting my hair grow out to its natural silver, it is a different texture and needs more moisture.  a little goes a long way, but keeps my curls soft and not frizzy.  do not over do it though if you have fine hair as it can be too much, but a little works magic
"
"
Works great. Every time after I wash my hair, I would pump a quarter-size amount into my palm and gently rub into my hair when it's half wet. The curls immediately show and are better maintained. The key is to air dry the hair after using the cream. I think the bottle will last me for quite some time. The subtle coconut smell is also pleasant.
"
"
I’ve been using the Deva Curl styling cream but thought I’d try the Super Cream after reading the reviews. I’m disappointed. I have long medium curls and thick hair. I have to use twice as much of the Super Cream (2 pumps) to get the same control as I do with the Styling Cream (1 pump). I don’t love the coconut scent either, I prefer the sweeter scent of the other one.  It works ok but I’ll go back to the styling cream once it’s gone
"
"
Loving it!  My hair is very thick with tight tight curls, and is very dry.  The decadence gives me more moisture than all the other products.
"
"
I am a black woman with naturally curly hair and extra fluffy when wet. I usually choose light conditioners, such  as Pantene because it does not weigh down my hair, Phelps define my curls, and smells good. I was hoping that this product would be nice to follow up with after rinsing my conditioner but I need to throw it in the trash ASAP. It weighs down my hair, causing my curls to not be as defined as they were before I added the product. My natural curly styles do not look good after using this. The only good thing about this product is it’s smell.
"
"
DevaCurls are high recommended! I no longer use heat tools, I just add the stilyng products and use the foam wires around my hair at the beginning when getting ready to mold my curls and once I’m finished getting ready I take the foam wires to reveal my curls
"
"
I have fine curly hair. I have always used the Devacurl be leave in gel plumper and love the volume it gives to my curls. It I was looking for something that would not leave that crunchy feeling in my hair. I had high Hope's for this product but I have to say I really dont like it. The cream seems to weigh down my curls and even when using just a tiny drop it leaves a greasy feeling in my hair all day. Will not be buying again.
"
"
I like this product, I have wavy hair, not terribly curly. If I want to straighten it, this product helps. If I want to boost the curl, it does the job. Great product!
"
"
OMG love this product. I have wavy hair and this creates curls, no need for styling other than scrunching and then running my fingers through my hair when dry. Looks even better the second day when I use a small amount of product on my dry hair.
"
"
I love this product! Doesn’t leave any residue when it dries down. I had been using Cantu but i would always get a white residue in my hair that I really hated. I had seen in some reviews people not getting actual deva curl products and this was a legit product, no issues with it leaking or arriving damaged either! Will order again.
"
"
Great smell. Seems to soften curls and conditions but I still need a mousse or gel to get my best curls. Was hoping this would be more of an all in one product but if I don’t add mousse or gel, my curls are dry and frizzy.
"
"
LOVE Deva Curl products, this is a great cream if used correctly.  I have naturally curly hair so I do not need a lot of products in my hair just to define the curls.  I use this with the devacurl light defining gel and I do not use a lot of it.
"
"
Good stuff, but I don't need to use it as much as I had expected because of other products I have.  Still, I am glad to have it on hand.  It is a little heavier than what I like, but it serves it purpose when I want that extra hold.
"
"
This is a nice product.  It’s not oily but it does have a The softener no effect that oil might have on hair.  You don’t need any other product with this.  It leaves your hair softly curled, bouncy and airy.  Not crunchy at all.  If you do want to ad more definition you can mix it with the devacurl foaming mouse. Wonderful product. I have 3b curls and I only use devacurl products.  I just with these products were more affordable but they very well can charge this much because it works! 😝

"
Only four stars because it does itch at night like every other product I've used. I'm trying to use less of it and see if that helps while keeping my hair styled. But it's one of the few products which tames my frizzy, curly hair and makes it somewhat manageable throughout the day.
"
"
I can't even begin to describe how amazing this product is. Where was this when I was a teen trying to tame my wayward curls?! It sculpts your curls but for real makes them touchably soft. I bit heavy but just go light at first to figure out how much you need. 1 to 2 pumps is perfect for me.
"
"
This is the only product I have found so far that actually helps tame my frizz (aside from gel, but I hate how tangled my hair gets with gel). I wasnt sure if this product was really doing anything until I forgot to put it on after a shower one day and my hair looked so frizzy and dry. I dont care for any of the other diva curl products, but this one is great.
"
"
Very creamy, my hair soaked it right up, left my hair moisturized all day.  It gave my curls moisture and volume, shrinkage is real, but not as noticeable as with other products.  I give this a thumbs up.  Gonna try it with the ultra gel to see if I can make this wash n go last a week.  Just steam, fluff and go
"
"
I have natural wave and some curl and a full head of super thick hair. I, have, forever been looking for a product that won't dry and leave my hair looking frizzy and/or crunchy. I use this DevaCurl along with Twirl Around Curl Definer and I now have BEAUTIFUL, healthy looking curls with little scrunching and NO crunch!!  People have definately noticed. Thankful to have finally found a product that does what it is designed to do!!  Best thing is, a little goes a long way and light, nice scent. Highly recommend
"
"
I love that this product does not weigh my hair down and does in fact reduce the frizz. DevaCurl is the most effective and trustworthy brand out there. Moreover, this product works for wavy, curly, super curly, and coily hair it helps moisturize and tame frizzy hair. Not to mention the fact that it smells wonderful! You won't find it for a better price, as it usually goes for about 24 dollars in stores like Ulta and the official DevaCurl site. All in all I will never stop using this specific product, it leaves my hair soft, frizz free and smelling amazing.
"
"
I have fine to medium textured type 3b curl's and this is my secret weapon for defined curls in the Puget Sound. I combine a pea sized amount with my Arc Angel gel. I've got curls for miles now! Second day I can add another pea sized dab to wet hand's and scrunch for instant hair renewall. I love this stuff <3
"
"
I use this and the other curl cream from this brand. I love both of them so much. They smell amazing and don’t leave a heavy product residue. I have extra long hair that’s always dyed hot pink and can use the extra mouisture. This product helps keep the frizz away. I highly recommend it!
"
"
I have been ordering these products for awhile through Amazon and this is the first time that I have ever been disappointed. See attached picture of how item arrived. Looks like some one took a utility knife and cut the top off. This is unacceptable!!! Can't even return it because it would just be ""goo"" in the bottom of the box like what I received and can't use it because the container was cut right below where the lid comes off and can't remove the lid to use the applicator. Won't be ordering these items again!!!
"
"
I had great expectations after reading some of the reviews but was greatly disappointed... Unfortunately, this product does not have great hold and it left my curls undefined and dry. It's not crunchy at all, which is a plus, but that's the only thing it has going for it :(
"
"
Like others have mentioned, my order of this product also arrived with the top coming off. I decided to use it anyway because I was out of the product and in the past it's kept my unruly and curly hair tamed. This is DEFINITELY NOT DevaCurl SuperCream. It looks like the product, but it does not smell or act like the product. It leaves my hair greasy and limp. :( I will not be purchasing this product from Amazon again, back to Ulta I go.
"
"
YES, YES, YES! Finally I found a curling cream for my natural hair. I'm am black (not bi-racial) and have between 4a and 3c natural hair. This product works so well! I find it works best when used on wet hair to do a twist outs overnight.
"
"
Well I’ve got this item after I read a couple reviews. I ordered and after hours I started reading more reviews about it and I saw bad reviews saying that these product it’s not good and it’s not original btw( if is it original I don’t know, but it works perfectly, smells good. Also I did a couple  searches about the company who sells  the products and they’re very big so I don’t think this is a fake product from devacurl. But I definitely suggest everyone to search more about this product. And Do Not buy if you’re a 100% sure that you want this product, cause you CANT RETURN IT.I’ll keep using it and I’ll let some updates about it here on my review
"
"
I’ve been using DC products since April 2019, and figured I’d give the super cream a try. I LOVE IT! My curls are definitely better defined and moisturized when I use this product. The scent is pleasant and the cream dries down well without leaving residue which is important to me! Highly recommend for all curly girls!
"
"
I finally broke down and spent the extra money for this product after hearing so much about it. I have nothing really bad to say about the product, it worked good and did what it was supposed to do. But I also use other products from the drug store that I felt had the same effect if not a little better on my hair and are half the cost or cheaper. It is good for curls, didn’t do much for my frizz but I just don’t feel that it is worth the prices that they have on their products
"
"
It worked pretty damn good in my hair. Did a great job of defining my curls but only if I blew it dry w diffuser (which it instructs you to do). My only negative thing is you really don't get any bang for your buck. I have thick hair but its short, above my shoulders and this lasted me not even 20 styles. (I ran out in less than a month). I love it but its just not a pocket friendly option for me and unfortunately, I'm ballin on a budget lol.
"
"
Bought this a few weeks ago and was so excited because I've heard a lot of good things about Deva Curl. However, I'm not a big fan. It makes my hair weighed down and dirty feeling after one day of use (usually I can wash my hair once a week, even with using product in between). It also caused my face to breakout. So, all around not impressed with this product.
"
"
I have fine hair with natural fingerwaves. This product didn't seem to do anything but weight my hair down and I lost some wave. Hair was still frizzy. I tried different amounts, different wetness and even dry hair application with no success.
"
"
Product is good there was no issue, I have also ordered the more quantity. But I have a little bit disappointed with the product packaging.When I received this product, I show that the product is completely destroyed.
"
"
The packaging looks the same--but it smells completely different and it's not nice.  Nothing like what my hairdresser uses on my hair.Big surprise--it's not returnable.
"
"
I've never had a product that truly curls the hair and takes out the frizz!  Wash hair, dry and scrunch, apply DivaCurl (generous amount), scrunch again and medium length hair drys with frizzless curls!
"
"
I didn’t really notice a huge difference in my daughters hair when using this stuff. It kept the curls nice, but once it dries, some of her curls became loose and a little unruly. I didn’t notice that much of a change to make me want to buy this product again. It may work for some curly haired people, but sadly not on my daughters hair. I was recommended this product by two friends who swear by it. If you’re on the fence and are able to give this a try, I would say why not? Give it a try, but don’t have high expectations in case it doesn’t work.
"
"
For my very curly hair, this is the perfect product to add.  I use it on wash day as well as when I need to refresh my curls.  Because I use a small amount of product, it doesn't make my hair crunchy.  My curls are soft and hold their spring all day long.
"
"
I have combination 3a/3b hair that is very fine.  This product largely eliminates the frizz and makes my curls look like bouncy ringlets.  It works best when you put it on your hair when wet and scrunch it up towards your roots and then dry it with a diffuser.  There are great youtube videos on how to use the product.After trying this, I stopped using other curly hair products and am now a DevaCurl fan.
"
"
I have fine frizzy wavy hair with some curls in some parts of my head (more on the back). This cream makes me have curls all over, and they dont look frizzy after I put the cream on my wet hair. I like the smell and texture (feels like normal hair texture in my opinion.. not ""crunchy""). Overall I like the product a lot but I also think it's a bit too expensive.
"
"
This is the stuff! Only need a dab.  Especially works well on my shorter curly hair. Can be left untouched for a wet look or I can run my fingers through after it’s dry for a dry curly look. Have been using it for several years.
"
"
Excellent product! Makes my 3c/4a curls very defined and moisturized. I only need one or two pumps for each side of my head. Very satisfied!
"
"
This is the best product I’ve used for my curls! It doesn’t leave them feeling stiff or sticky when it dries, as so many other products do. It helps the spiral to form, plus they’re hydrated, soft to the touch, and healthy. Less is more with this product. I’ve found it works best with barely a nickel sized amount so the bottle lasts forever.
"
"
Best curl cream so far.  My old favorite was “Samy Curls” but now is out of production Follow directions for use, apply to wet hair.  Curls dry beautifully and are soft to the touch.  You will love.
"
"
Daughter has natural curly hair. This has always worked great to keep her curls natural and she doesn’t complain about any crunchiness-like other salon brands cause.  Worth the cost. Just give yourself a day or so to get the amount needed right.
"
"
I bought this to try it, and love it. But then I purchased the kit with many products and somehow I started getting scabs in my scalp. Great curl keeper but build up is horrendous. Try using less and hair got fuzzy. Not worth the money. Staying with Shea Moisture 12$ curl smoothie.
"
"
I like this cream for my curly hair, but I find that I need to use a lot of it to get enough control and I end up using it way too fast for the price.  Still looking for something less expensive or longer lasting.
"
"
This stuff is fantastic especially when used with the DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner. I only use this now to fix my curly hair. I live in humid southern Louisiana and this controls any frizz I would have. The curl definition is great and my curls aren't crunchy. I will never use anything else!
"
"
I cannot say enough about how much I love this product line! I have extremely thick, dry and coarse hair. After my first use, my hair feels silky smooth, is shiny and my curls are bouncy and frizz free!
"
"
DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHERS FROM DEVA CURL!!! I’ve experience damage, curl pattern changes, and extreme damage to my hair using these products. They worked the first couple times and over time, the damage is so noticeable. Save your money and your heartache.
"
"
If you are looking for something with minimal to max control this is a great product even for shorter wavy hair. I have short hair and use about a teaspoon or so. It's soft, fresh smelling with a hint of coconut. One really good thing about this is the container. On one side is a peekaboo opening that allows you to see how much product is left. Great idea!
"
"
It left my hair hard, white flakes, and it did not do anything exciting to my curls. This product is just not working. I used the SuperCream, Curl Plumper, and they both did not work on my type of hair.
"
"
The coconut scent is simply not one of my favorite scents, so I prefer the STYLING cream scent over this one. However, it works just like the styling cream. Apply to wet/damp hair to magically create controlled curls!
"
"
Product is a knock off . Makes sense to why it’s xheaper than usual. It has made my hair super dry and the ends feel nasty . Very disappointed in the seller .
"
"
This cream is amazing! I usually use extra conditioner to style my hair but this does the trick perfectly! Doesnt make your hair hard feeling like most stylers, makes a nice soft natural look. Can put in dry and wet hair for different looks. Deva curl is definitley my new go to for naturally curly hair products im in love with this cream! Pretty big bottle as well.
"
"
I love it.  I was turned onto Deva products by my daughter.  Skeptical.  This product not only defines curl without hairspray or whatever, but it adds volume.  A+
"
"
This is my new holy grail product.  A few pumps of this scrunched into my hair, followed by a little arc angel gel for hold, and my curls look exactly how I like them.  My hair also seems to be less prone to dryness after using this product.
"
"
Its a little heavy (thick)  and pricey - smells good - gets used up pretty fast
"
"
This product does not seem authentic. It smells expired or that it may have been mixed with a cheaper product. I do not recommend.
"
"
My hair dresser recommended this product for daughter who has super curly mixed hair. It was not a helpful product. Rather just use Pantene as a leave in. Worked better and this product was pretty expensive compared to store brands
"
"
A staple in my curl routine. A notable change in my curls from the first use. Helps define curls like no other. I can tell the difference in my hair every time I skip out on this product. Yes it’s expensive but it’s 100% worth it. I’ve tried so many products and this one is a complete game changer.
"
"
I wanted to love this product but I was iffy on buying it knowing it’s for super curly hair. Sadly, it didn’t work for mine :( I have thin, wavy to half curly hair..it just made my hair greasy. I’m trying their wavy gel next! This product smells great though 😊
"
"
I have curly hair and actually use this to keep the frizz down when I straighten it. if you use too much it will make your hair gross and oily looking but a very small amount goes a long way.
"
"
Love the product line.  Works great just as described.  Hubby ever used it for his hair which he claims he can brush out without frizz.  The price is great!  Ulta has it for double.
"
"
Great product for the price! Smells good, works wonders well.I saw other reviews where the product was delivered damaged due to poor packaging and I was concerned. Happy to see this was rectified as I received my product in tact, no spillage. Thanks!
"
"
Unless you are going from never having used product before to this, I don't think it's very impressive. I usually use Catwalk Curls and Pantene Curls Mousse and that has always worked well. Decided to give DevaCurls a try and used it without my other products. I'd say my hair was slightly curlier, but the curl didn't hold and it was very frizzy/fluffy. I definitely put enough in, so I think next time I'll add my mousse too.
"
"
my hair is starting to loose its curls and is gradually becoming more loose waves then curly, this product has helped keep my waves a little tighter. smells great and not sticky love it!!
"
"
Second time ordering this as I loved how my hair turned out.  Used it after seeing a video appliction and liked the results.  A little goes a long way!! Smells great too! Gave 4 stars only because it was over priced.
"
"
When I removed the container from the plastic packaging, it already had product oozing out of it. I removed the lid & the entire top came off with it. After placing the top back on, the pump doesn’t work. Very disappointing as this seller does not accept returns. Love Deva products but won’t be buying from this seller again.
"
"
I LOVE this product SO much. i wish there was a 32oz pump bottle for this. I can not & have not found anything similar to this product. My curls love love love this. I read in some reviews about acne & breaking out, I will keep an eye out for that, but so far I have not experienced any. To look at my curls Check my IG CurlsNGains :)
"
"
After buying my first round of DevaCurl products, I’ll be a lifetime buyer. It’s expensive but my curls are perfect. Woke up with all my curls looked perfect.
"
"
I have very curly, frizzy, unruly hair.  I have tried just about everything on the market and finally decided to try the Deva Curl products.  I am a new woman.  I absolutely love all of the products.  I use the no poo cleanser, conditioner, mousse and Coconut Curl Styler Cream.  My hair has never looked better.  These will be my products from now on,.
"
"
I just gave 1 star because i couldn't give it ZERO stars.  This cream does NOT work even after parting my hair to apply cream evenly.  I'm highly upset that i spent so much money for a crappy cream.
"
"
I have used this product before but decided to buy this from amazon this time. This product was horrible on my hair. I repurchased the same product, but this time, directly from Deva Curl. First day of use and my hair is already better. Not sure if this is a bad product or a counterfeit product but I significantly noticed a difference with my hair and will not buy this from amazon again. I will only buy direct from Deva Curl.
"
"
Great product and is definitely a lot cheaper if you back here on this site. Love the way it makes my hair feel.
"
"
Love it for my long, curly hair and much cheaper than the Moroccan oil curl cream I was using.  I ended up buying the shampoo and conditioner as well.
"
"
What I liked the most it's that as soon as the hair gets dry I can see my beautiful curls. What I liked the less it's that it doesn't quite work on my hair in the front of my head, for some reason it just leaves it straight so I have to use more cream in that specific part.
"
"
Beautiful soft curls. Looks like I’m not using anything on my hair. Light shine without the processed look. Healthy!!
"
"
I don't just love this stuff, I adore it!! I used the regular Deva Curl Styling Cream for years but when this new Coconut Curl cream came out I tried it immediately and fell madly in LOVE with it. It is perfect for my wavy/curly hair and it smells AMAZING!!
"
"
I absolutely love Deva Cream BUT twice now the bottle comes apart and doesn't work anymore, despite the fact the there's still lots of produce  left.
"
"
This is the only thing that tames my lion mane. I mid length, very wavy and frizzy hair  -  I usually go through about a bottle every 45 days and use only two pumps of product at best. This is a great price as its very more in Sephora
"
"
I got a devacut and she recommended this product to style and I have been hooked ever since, it doesn't have a horrible smell, and it works great, works even better when you style in the shower.
"
"
Excellent for keeping my curls moisturized. It keeps my curls from frizzing, and allows me to have excellent second day curls.
"
"
If you have curly hair, this is perfect for you!! You gotta try this & you won't regret it. The only product my kid will use on her hair. Seriously.....try it.
"
"
I absolutely love the Deva Curl line of products. I feel they are slightly expensive, but not as expensive as another product I used that made my hair fall out a lot in the shower. This stuff smells amazing. Feels great in my hair. I use it with the Deva Curl Set It Free. I use the Set It Free on my ends that are the driest. Recently bought my Deva Curl Towel. I love the feel and it's good for my hair! No more regular towels. Highly recommend this product.
"
"
I'm super bummed. No matter how much I use, I can't get an even coat that rights frizz consistently. It also dries out my hair.
"
"
After years of using a product that costs 1/3 the price of DevaCurl, I decided to give this a shot due to some rave Instagram reviews. I must say I am deeply disappointed, and this is the frizziest I've ever seen my hair. I have been using the product for about a week now and am definitely going back to my old product!
"
"
Super cream is my HERO! I use this in conjunction with the Devacurl wavy line of shampoo/conditioner and Wavemaker. The Wavemaker does a good job, but even still my curls were falling limp and frizzing by the end of the day. Supercream to the rescue!!! My curls last all day (even overnight!) and they’re still soft and pliable throughout the day. Love. This. Stuff. Perfect for wavy girls who need that extra bit of oomph to boost that curl.
"
"
I've tried a good number of DevaCurl products and by far this one is my favorite for conditioning curls and styling for air drying. It's a great detangler and curl setter while keeping my hair soft and smooth with little frizz.
"
"
My curly hair has never looked better than when I started using DevaCurl products.  Their SuperCream styler leaves my hair super moisturized and eliminates frizzy curls. Of all the hair products for curls I've used this is the brand that delivers.
"
"
Really like the product not first time buying it.  However, it was packaged with the camp folding stool and the top came loose and spilled on the stool.  I lost almost half of the product and wanted to return it but found out it was not eligible for return.  This is not a review of the product but a complaint of the packaging.
"
"
It smells great but does not help my curls anymore than the less expensive brands
"
"
I’ve tried many many products and have finally found my holy grail. I use this stuff everyday and don’t ever see myself switching.  I’m obsessed.
"
"
This product is horrible. Weighed down my hair and frizzed it, didn’t even help the curls at all even if I put my hair in a bun. I wish I could get my money back. The only good thing is it smelled alright.
"
"
I've used this curl cream in the past but tried another Deva Curl product for a while. I was running low and decided to return to the cream - and I am so glad I did! My curls are bouncy, light, and happy! I can't say enough about Deva Curl and how well it handles my hair.
"
"
5 stars! I love this product. It feels great. I apply it to my curly hair, still damp from shower, scrunch and go. Keeps the frizz down and doesn't leave any stickiness or residue. I've purchased this several times.
"
"
Product is hood but it arrived with lotion leaking out of the bottle all over the plastic wrapping
"
"
Love the smell, I lather lots in my wet hair, it’s not sticky and it reduces frizz. I wash my hair every 3 days but in between washes I wet my hair and reapply a bit more cream.When I first apply it does look wet and crunchy. Once it dries, i fluff my hair and it looks a hell of a lot better. I also have some strays so not sure if it keeps it all together 100%.
"
"
Tried it out for the first time after YouTube reviews, OMG finally something that works for my dry curly hair leaves hair soft manageable and shapes your natural curls lovely expensive but worth it!
"
"
The only thing I use for my curly hair. Love the cream and scent but not a fan of the new container. A little hard to pump out and I fear there will be a lot of waste when it gets below the pump. For the price I want to be able to use every last drop like their previous packaging.
"
"
Very good smelling hair cream.Lightweight.Feels good helps maintain my curlsWill continue to use for now
"
"
Absolutely love this stuff. It curls my curls and makes my waves look fabulous. I was skeptical, but it works great.
"
"
delivered in tact, didn't have an issue.  doesn't make my hair greasy, it's a nice leave in cream that softens and defines my curls
"
"
Product arrived damaged-the contents of the container had leaked everywhere, leaving it unusable. A total waste of money, as the seller has a “no return” policy, so you can’t even initiate a conversation about a replacement.
"
"
This is not a real Deva Curl.  It is not authentic.  I have been using this for years.  First bottle that has not worked effectively on my curls.  WILL NOT BUY THIS ONE AGAIN.  No replacement policy either
"
"
I’ve been using this cream for almost two years now. It’s moisturizing and smells great. I use 1.5 to 2 squirts on my hair right out of the shower then apply a curly hair mouse or gel. I have 2C/3A curly hair that is dense, thick and course.
"
"
I’m always searching for a curl defining cream that works and doesn’t leave my curls “crunchy”. This product doesn’t do either. It didn’t add any definition to my curls and actually made them look flat. Definitely not worth the money.
"
"
I'm on the fence. I like the smell, but I feel like I need to use a lot of the product or mix it with a gel to get the holding power I need. Usually this stuff is expensive but I saw it here on Amazon for $14 so I thought I would give it another chance. Still feel the same.
"
"
I love this it smells nice helps my curls look nice  I had cancer and my once straight hair is now curly it’s called chemo curl I will keep reordering
"
"
This is great for curly hair especially in the summer...puts moisture back in & smells nice
"
"
Me encanto
"
"
If you have natural curly hair I highly recommend this product. I have short curly hair that is salt and pepper and it's always been an issue of trying to control the friz and the uncontrollable grey this product does it all for me. Just love it!!!
"
"
I love this stuff! I have super fine curly hair that is easily weighed down into limp strands so I can't use a lot of styling products. It leaves my hair with completely natural looking curls, with no crunch or shine. Right after i started using the DevaCurl SuperCream my friends started to ask how my hair is always so curly and natural looking! I received it as a gift for Christmas about 2 years ago and I've been using it ever since.
"
"
I have untamable hair in humidity, was hoping this would help. Unfortunately not, and yet another product goes to the “failed” bin.
"
"
This I like a lot.  Would love it in a bigger bottle!  I think it works better than the Leave-In.  Packaged perfectly no leakage!
"
"
My thick curly hair is so much softer and the ringlets are better.
"
"
The bottle came wide open and broken, spilled all over the package
"
"
Have been using this product for years! Nothing else holds my curls without making them crunchy. My hair is smooth and keeps its curl.
"
"
Smells good and not too heavy when applied, but did not moisturize my hair well enough.
"
"
Deva curl has solved all my curly hair problems. seriously. Never looking back. Finally at age 30, curly hair level unlocked. All thanks to this ( and the gel) product.
"
"
Love this product, made my wavy damaged hair back to the curls I had before my straight iron!Works great and don’t need to use a lot. Would recommend
"
"
The product does not smell, or look like what I have bought in the past from Deva Curl.  I will not be purchasing this product from seller again.  Beware, of discounted products.  It may be fake!
"
"
I didn't really do anything better than my other products. Won't buy again.
"
"
Please do not purchase Devacurl products!! Many people report losing hair and complete damage to their hair. I unfortunately purchased this prior to making the connection with my scalp issues and have suffered from intense scalp issues and hair loss. There is a class action lawsuit with this company.
"
"
Absolutely Love this! Makes my curls so soft & healthy looking! Will definitely buy again!
"
"
I use it as suggested, but my hair only curls for an hour or so and then it's limp and very frizzy. There is no hold from what I can tell. Pretty disappointed considering the price. I don't like the firm hold of mousse, but haven't found one I like that isn't like that.
"
"
My favorite product. I apply this everytime I wash my hair and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and moisturized. Also it smells amazing! I also use this as a detangler since the conditioner doesn’t work for me.
"
"
I am absolutely loving this product! I have 3B type curls and I begin with a leave in spray and then I use this and diffuse; the results are amazing every single time! Leaves my hair feeling soft and defined. Highly recommend it and worth every penny!
"
"
This product completely changed how my curls feel and look. It made me re-fall in love with my hair. I usually moisturize my curls about 3-4 times per week between my wash days,  but I only moisturize once weekly with DevaCurl. My hair never feels oily or dirty, stays smelling amazing, and is the softest it has ever been. Buy this!!!
"
"
I have ordered this product a few times. It has a great hold of my curls but tends to make my hair a little dry. I end up having to use a little oil to keep it moisturized. I’ll keep ordering it.
"
"
I really like this product. It leaves my hair manageable, so soft & the curls are so popping! The only product that leaves my hair the way I've always wanted it - hassle free, light weight & so soft
"
"
I love this!! I’ve tried everything and mixed everything to find the perfect “cocktail” for my curls. I’m able to use this alone and it holds my curls and gives them bounce without crunch and flaking. I can flip my hair every which way and it only adds volume. Doesn’t break the curls into frizz. FINALLY!! I think I’m a 2C/3A curl
"
"
Doesn’t cause my curls to be crunchy, helps eliminate frizz, and moisturizes the curls.
"
"
Just didn't do a great job for my curls
"
"
I love this stuff. Gives my hair fullness it has had in years. I have fine curly hair and this makes it looks super thick and keeps curls from frizzing. Smells fab too.
"
"
This is one of the only products I can add to my hair and it immediately feels moisturized. It gives  great slip once applied and is great when detangling hair.  This product doesn’t feel like it’s sitting on top of my hair, it really penetrates each strand.  The smell is also blissful!
"
"
This Product helps turn frizzy hair into curly hair. A bit expensive, but if you want to look your best, its worth the money.
"
"
It makes nice curls.  I've had a lot of compliments on the scent.
"
"
I have thin, tight, white girl curls. This stuff is amazing - moisturizes and holds without weighing it down. I use it mostly on my ends.
"
"
Keeps curls moisturized and helps keep curls frizz free.  Great product!
"
"
Destroyed my hair my hair is so dry it just breaks off
"
"
Love this product - perfect to reduce frizz when used along with the devacurl line - I especially like the One condition decadence conditioner and ArcAngel gel.

Excellent on 3a/b hair texture. It will keep the moisture inside the hair and tame some friz however you will still need a gel to define the curl to its full extent!
"
"
I use this product on my fine clean curly hair after using a little of the B'Leave-In Volumizer. One pump does the trick for my chin length hair. I let my hair air dry then pull the curls out a bit with a pick. It leaves my hair shiny, soft and fresh smelling. I spritz a little Set-It Free on top to add additional shine and hold. I love Deva Curl Products!
"
"
Awesome product if used as directed! Great bang for buck. Works great!
"
"
Been using this curl cream for a few months now and I absolutely love it. It has really changed my hair for the better. I now pair it with the Deva Arc gel for soft and defined curls.
"
"
I really like this curl cream. It makes my hair feel soft and it smells amazing. You only need a small amount. I would recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.
"
"
My curls are definitely more defined. I have thick curly hair and the cream helps them stay longer. On the second day I usually just spray water and the curls are back.
"
"
The bottle broke when I received it! And there is no return policy so I can't get a replacement! The entire top of the bottle came off!
"
"
Did curly my hair. Worked better when I used the diffuser
"
"
This product does nothing but make my hair matted and dry. I've used this brand and product before, purchased elsewhere and didnt have an issue. I guess I got some watered down knock off.
"
"
I like that it doesn’t make  my hair  hard like other hair products, so my curls are smooth
"
"
This is a really good product for naturally curly hair.  It isn't heavy and helps with frizz issues.
"
"
Silky and rich for smooth comb through. Lightweight once it’s on. We use it on wet hair to detangle and moisturize. My daughter has bi-racial hair; best product we have found. It allows natural curl to come through when air drying.
"
"
Accidentally ordered the coconut one instead of the regular one. I like it but I think the regular Devacurl defines better for me.
"
"
I love this cream for my daughter’s hair. It makes her curls so beautiful. Without this stuff her hair is a frizzy mess. I’m glad I stumbled upon it. It also has a good coconut smell plus a little product goes along way. She uses this when her hair is wet.
"
"
With curly hair, I have been trying tons of different curly hair products for over 30 years.  This one has made the top of my list.
"
"
I love using this curl cream. Little to no frizz!
"
"
Nothing special here.  Can get the same results with store products - not worth the $
"
"
Love this product!! It does wonders on my curls. It gives a good hold and keeps my hair fresh for days. I will use this forever!
"
"
Do not buy!!!!!! I read the other reviews, but still decided to give it a try and like many others, it arrived broken. Upon trying to take off th cover I discovered it was completely in half.
"
"
totally fake , don’t buy it .... and the worst is that they don’t let you return itso becareful with this product
"
"
very moisturizing and makes my hair feel softer... curls will last all week.
"
"
It's okay, just cheaper through Amazon than at the salon.
"
"
This cream smells so good. It leaves my hair super soft. I usually use it for LOC method or if I go to the beach.
"
"
My 15 year old is a cancer survivor, her hair came back super curly. It was long and straight, this is the only thing she uses to keep it nice and curly with no frizz
"
"
Love this product, works great and smells amazing also!
"
"
I normally use Natural Formula Go Curly and I tried this out because it was recommended to me. I used this once and went right back to Natural Formula. If I want defined curls I have to use SO MUCH of this and then my hair is weighed down. Do not recommend.
"
"
Love this product , it really helps my curls to not turn frizzy.
"
"
Not sure that it works that well. Smells nice, soft feel and not too heavy but doesnt seem to do much
"
"
Worked this in the night before after washing and then again in the morning to help with frizz before diffusing. Great soft curls and the coconut scent is so yummy for summer.
"
"
Helps elimate frizz and makes your hair so soft. Just use a little or it will make your hair flat.
"
"
Recently heard amazon doesn’t sell deva curl products. I got this product from deva curl and compared to two. THIS IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!! don’t waste money on this, buy the more expensive one, you’ll use way less of it!
"
"
I have thick grey (colored) yuk yuk curly hair, makes mine beautiful!
"
"
This product works great. I’ve been working on going back to my natural curls and this product has helped a lot!
"
"
After many years of trying different products for my frizzy hair I finally found what I’ve been looking for! I start with the Coconut Whipped Cream Leave in conditioner and then apply the DevaCurl Super Cream. This keeps my curls together and make it soft and beautiful. I’m recommending this to all of my curly haired friends!
"
"
I have had this product before and love it
"
"
She loved the product
"
"
To soften my curls and moisturizer
"
"
Fixes curls without being hard or sticky
"
"
Good
"
"
LOVE THE PRODUCT! but my lid popped off almost randomly when I was using it. I may have offened it in some unknown way. Not sure. So using it though.
"
"
I love this product! I got a sample long time ago and wanted to purchase it, then I lost the bottle. I got another sample and finally found the name and ordered it. I am so happy. This is the only way I can just embrace and enjoy my natural curls. This is amazing. You guys have to try it! I never even leave reviews, but I had to share.
"
"
Love this product for my curly hair!!  One of the best i have ever used.  Curls look very healthy and not frizzy.  Highly recommend!!
"
"
Excellent to help with those natural curls
"
"
To soften and encourage curling.
"
"
Thick and yukky.
"
"
This cream keeps the moisture in the hair and doesn't make it dry. It brings the curves of your curls however can sometimes make the root of your hair very smooth that it falls down and doesn't give it volume.
"
"
This smells so delicious like coconuts! Very amazing for curly hair moisturizing and prefer over the styling cream comes in awesome pump bottle will definitely be purchasing again T
"
"
It’s the first time I’m trying DevaCurl products and so far I love what it does to my hair. Usually my hair gets very dry and feels hard whenever I use cream, but with this cream it stays soft, curls real nice and smells great!! Will be ordering again
"
"
It makes my hair so heavy, I have to wash my hair the next day after I use this product. It does not give any style to my curls, in fact, makes it worse!
"
"
Recommended by my salon stylist. Better value than retail.
"
"
Great
"
"
Worked great for like a month and then my hair started getting drier! It was weird works great as an alternative to gel or moose to style your hair.
"
"
Never using anything else again
"
"
Great stuff. Moisturizes, defines curls, and has little scent.
"
"
Great product for curly hair.
"
"
I use nothing else.
"
"
In love
"
"
I love Deva Curl Supercream.  I sometimes use the Deva Curl gel, but I prefer the Coconut Curl Styler.  It keeps my very curly hair in control and looking good.  I received my shipment promptly and it arrived in A+ condition.
"
"
I LOVE this product, but it is too expensive for the size of bottle. I appreciate DevaCurl and all they do for curly girls, don't get me wrong! But for the size of the bottle, I can only get about 2 months of curls and that adds up fast.
"
"
My hair got so frizzy!  Disappointed!
"
"
Weighed my hair down too much but smells good.
"
"
Love this cream. I've been using it since I got my first deva cut and it works great. One bottle lasted me 5 months at least. My favorite hair product.
"
"
It smells bad like dirty hair also it makes the hair so dry i’m go Threw it away cuz I cannot use it again don’t lose ur money
"
"
Trying  to tame flyaway hair.
"
"
This is my favorite styling cream for my hair. It keeps my curls soft and bouncy and does not weigh my hair down or damage my hair. Love it!
"
"
Omg leaves my curls bounced & shiny! I’ve gotten so many compliments a little goes a long way!
"
"
Not amazing I think the other precut by Deva are better but this does lock in the curl and if used when hair is super wet and than lightly dried with diffuser you get good results.
"
"
Smells awesome.
"
"
I absolutely Love this product! Its incredible, smells great and does wonders for your hair. my only complaint is that the packaged arrived with the pump and entire top of the container off/disconnected. there was some spillage but I will have to dig into the container to get the product out.
"
"
I have curly hair. This product produced soft, healthy curls all the time! Love it! Great also on humid days. Will buy again!
"
"
Okay I ordered this because of a Buzzfeed article (something I have never done before) and OMG I'm so glad I found this!! I have type 2B waves and so MULTIPLE layers of hair. The bottom layer of my hair was always frizzy and gross looking so I could never do a half-up style unless I straightened it, which is annoying. I used this for the first time today and my hair looks 1000 times better!! Seriously this is so worth it!
"
"
It smells heavenly and works wonders for my hair.
"
"
Great product it works really good on my son’s curls !
"
"
Really defines my curls
"
"
Didn’t se the results most reviewers saw. It smells nice and that’s about it. Doesn’t moisturize my hair very well.
"
"
love this!!!!!!!
"
"
It was thicker than I anticipated for a cream. I wasn’t blown away or impressed with the product. I have bought much cheaper curl creams that worked just as good if not better.
"
"
Love this stuff! It works great on my daughter's super curly hair, but I have to use sparingly on my wavy hair so it isn't weighed down.
"
"
Nice curly cream
"
"
I used the dash button to reorder the Deva Super Cream.  Instead of the super cream, I received the basic styling cream.  Deva has so many products with similar packaging that it is easy to mistake one for the other.  I kept it because I needed product asap.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair I apply DevaCurl to my wet hair to give me individual curls without frizz. The curls stay uniform and soft all day long. I have used this product for several years.
"
"
Very unhappy about this item. I wanted to try it out due to hearing amazing reviews. Unfortunately, it made my scalp very dry and flakey. I never had this problem until trying this product. Wanted to return and found out that it is not refundable.
"
"
My hair has always been difficult for me when it's curly so I always use a flat iron. I have wavy curls and very thick hair and I have to use a lot of gel to keep it from getting big and poofy. I have never found a product that keeps it from being crunchy and also gives it defined bouncy curls without too much crunch. It feels natural and soft. I use the gel and cream together and can't believe how well it works. I do a little bit of drying with a diffuser and then top it off with Paul Mitchell super skinny serum.  My curls are beautiful and defined and I can finally wear it curly everyday without feeling self conscious! This stuff works like magic!
"
"
Great little cream. I use it on my mini fro when I don't feel like twisting it.I'm a black male with 4c hair
"
"
It's okay.  Not heavy, not crunchy.  Okay curls, but not much volume.  Feels like my hair is just hanging down
"
"
Perfect for wavy/ curly hair! Smells great!And leaves your hair soft, not sticky or hard.
"
"
Wife's hair looks great!
"
"
I did not see any difference to my curls
"
"
Worked just as expected.  I have curly (permed) hair.  The product kept my hair from getting frizzy and gave it a more defined appearance.  Liked it enough that I went back and bought the fill sized product.
"
"
Extremely dissatisfied. This product not only builds up in my hair but seems to way it down also, causing less curl and volume. I wouldn't recommend nor repurchase this item. I actually ended up giving it away just to feel better about buying it.
"
"
Deva curls product was supposed to be the solution to my daughters thick curly hair and it did not work
"
"
Great products
"
"
If you have a  curly hairThis is the best
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
This stuff is AMAZING. Smells great, not sticky, does a terrific job at detangling and moisturizing my hair and my daughter’s hair. Highly recommend.
"
"
This is the holy grail for me as far as curly hair products come.  Doesn't weigh my hair down and adds softness and definition.
"
"
The slip is amazing and not as heavy as others claim to be.. It’s great!
"
"
I really liked it's smell. Helps me to get rid of the fizzy look. Voila!
"
"
This is pure magic. I have naturally curly hair -sometimes-. Depending on the day, weather, and how I slept on it, the curls easily fall into a wavy mess. This cream helps to encourage curls and keeps them. Have not found another product that works as well.
"
"
Great for curly/ wavy hair.
"
"
Did not work for my looser curl type. My hair frizzed when using only this product.
"
"
After hearing many people attest to this product, I decided to try it for my curls. Sadly, it didn't work for me. It didn't give me any volume, it didn't define my curls and the product didn't hold my curl. The only thing it did was make sure my curls didn't shrink. I wouldn't purchase it again.
"
"
Love this product!! I use to have really curly hair but it’s extremely heat damaged and it’s more wavy straight now. This product definitely helps revamp my natural curl pattern.
"
"
Smells great and really hydrates my locks! The formula is a bit heavy though, so be conscious about what other products you are putting in your hair, so that your curls don't get weighed down
"
"
This product does not work either, bought both this and the Deva B' Leave In Curl Boost.......... just a farce on both items. waste of money
"
"
I love this curl cream. It holds my hair without being heavy. It smells amazing.
"
"
LOVE IT!!! Makes my curls curly and soft and smells wonderful!! Will be buying more in the next few weeks. A little goes a long way. Super product!!!
"
"
This is my second favorite product to use for my stubborn curls. It's a little thick but little goes a long way and it makes my curls look glossy and defined.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and I really love the way this product tames my curls and keeps the fly aways tamed.
"
"
2c/3a hair--this is a bit heavy on my hair. Do not use it on wet hair. It's fine for taming frizz on second or third day hair but I prefer spray oils over a cream that has to be applied by hand.
"
"
Be an informed consumer, this line is currently under investigation for a class action lawsuit.
"
"
not original. i want to get a refund
"
"
I bought two of the super cream but received the styling cream instead and it’s not allowing me to return my order what so ever, now I’m out 40 bucks and two products that don’t work with my hair
"
"
After reading the reviews, I was so excited to try the product. But I was really disappointed and won’t buy it again.
"
"
Smells so good and the tinest bit goes a very long way. Makes my hair feel and look great
"
"
As a curly girl for 43 years, I’ve tried many products and home remedies for controlling the curls without drying them or looking like I put petroleum gel on my head!! This product is perfect for my hair, no drying and no extra greasy feeling either! My curls are soft and controlled and smell great!
"
"
Very unhappy with my purchase. I got both the super cream and the ultra defining gel and both look used. The super cream came with no lid and both bottles look dirty and damaged. Would 100% prefer to pay more money and buy it from their official website.
"
"
This cream works very well in my hair, I use it everyday.
"
"
This is the best product I gave ever used for curly hair! It's awsome!
"
"
I battle with  dry frizzy thick curls. This product held my curls together without crunch, so soft and smells wonderful. Made my hair shine and healthy looking.
"
"
Smells nothing like it should
"
"
My favorite styler everrrr !! Smells amazing , does wonders , but make sure to comb through to avoid hard hair .
"
"
Did not the like the pump at all and it seems its less product that what the bottle shows. Product is ok not the best I ever tried and since its an inconvenient pump I won't be buying it again.
"
"
I need products that hydrate my thick  dry curls and this does the trick. I'm usually not that impressed with the DevaCurl products for my hair type, but this product works well for my particular hair which craves humectants.
"
"
Love this so hydrating and smells amazing!
"
"
Awful.... very disappointed... does not hold at all, on the greasy/sticky side and makes my hair tangle.  I figured I would give this a shot after bed head contour cream changed their formula, thought this would be my alternate option but obviously this product is far from being great for curls!!  Don’t waste your money!
"
"
Pros: my curls were more definedCons: texture greasy but hair does not look shiny.I have acne prone skin and this product made me break out a lot. Will not purchase this product again
"
"
I love this product, but it came completely exploded in the box. I'm extremely upset at the way they packaged what is clearly a bottle that can have it's top come off in transport. Think carefully before buying.
"
"
good
"
"
Great product, I had years of frizz before I found Deva curl.
"
"
Works ok. This is not the best product for my hair, but everyone's hair texture is different.
"
"
Wow, this really does enhance my natural curl. I love this! I highly recommend it!
"
"
I like this product. However, shipment arrived like this. App provides no option to return.
"
"
I've struggled to find a cream that I like but this one is awesome! I use it with my B-leave in and I get awesome results! You don't need to use a lot and it smells bomb. Also it doesn't weight my curls down. I would add an extra moisturizing leave in before because it isn't super hydrating if you have dry hair.
"
"
Love this product. Gets rid of frz and makes soft curls
"
"
Smells great just doesn’t hold curl as well
"
"
I highly recommend Deva Curl Coconut Curl Styler for any curly top!
"
"
This product is just ok.  I love Deva Curl products but this one weighs my hair down.  It smells WONDERFUL.  I use it every now and then so it doesn't go to waste but I will not purchase again.
"
"
I have wavy to curly hair. I love how this adds definition and hold without it feeling greasy or crunchy.
"
"
Works great with my frizzy curly hair
"
"
Since I used this cream I love my hair. It helps me to keep my curly hair without frizz
"
"
Love the smell and the curl it gives to my hair.
"
"
I think the product is great so far and the scent smells good. However,  the top wasnt screwed on all the way so most of the product is inside the envelope so that is a little disappointing.
"
"
If your curls need a drink and definition this is your miracle worker!
"
"
Smells great and does what it says.
"
"
It works great
"
"
Happy I found this hair care product.
"
"
This is a great product for naturally curly hair, but for me personally, I like the DevaCurl B'Leave-In better.
"
"
DevaCurl super cream works so well for my hair. It's becoming my one and only!
"
"
I really like this styler. I think it's the best of the devacurl line, unfortunately the amount doesn't go far. The instructions do say to use sparingly, but sparingly does not cut it for my hair.
"
"
Nice soft hold.
"
"
I have frizzy hair to the max!  This works so well to manage the frizz while keeping then soft!
"
"
Love this stuff! Tames the frizzies and refreshes curls. Wish I had found it years ago
"
"
It works
"
"
Love this product. It works amazingly well.
"
"
Magic! I don't do much styling to my hair. All I do is wet it and scrunch this stuff in. Let it dry then shake out my hair. The coconut one is a little stickier than the other style but not bad. Definitely recommend this for anyone with friz issues
"
"
My daughter has very  curly hair. This product helps her hair not to be frizzy and looks moisturized and not dry. Even applying again on damp hair in the mornings without having to rewash it.
"
"
My hair is so soft because of this product. I have red hair and I thought I couldn't use it because it's not for hair dyes. I was bold enough to use it and BOOM! Curls everywhere LOL
"
"
LOVE!!!  Doesn't make your hair crunchy.  Perfect holding power for your curls.
"
"
Makes my hair so frizzy. Disappointed.
"
"
This is my new favorite product for getting my hair curly! It also smells awesome
"
"
Great product, I cant believe how much of a difference this product has on my curly hair, totally worth the money!
"
"
Loss all hair to chemo treatments. My hair came back very curly. This product makes my curls looks absolutely adorable. It has the softness with the amazing aroma of lightly scented coconut. After applying use a small amount of Shea moisturizing refine serum for gloss.
"
"
Los productos devacurls son muy buenos lo unico que llego roto e visto varis fotos de clientes k les llego roto pareciera que no son iriginales ..🤔🤔
"
"
This is a very good product and I wish you came in a larger bottle
"
"
Love the coconut smell every time when applying this to my damp hair. This is a most after I get out of the shower for my routine.
"
"
I have thick coarse frizzy hair and I use this on my wet hair before I diffuse. It works beautifully to give definition to the curl without being to heavy-plus it smells great!
"
"
I like this product. It makes my curls really pop. Doesn't keep them as frizz free as I like.
"
"
Love this product for my daughters hair. Gives good hold without being crunchy
"
"
My wavy hair was very frizzy and ""big"" when using this product, which is a major bummer because the deva curl line is great! I have to mix it with a gel to make it tame my curl. Definitely would not purchase again!
"
"
My favorite product fur my curly hair
"
"
I liked everything about this product
"
"
The product was sticky and left product deposits on my hair. I was not really impressed.
"
"
I love this stuff. It gets rid of my fridge is with out making my hair feel “crunchy.”
"
"
Great product
"
"
Smells great and really curls my hair nicely. Calms the frizz
"
"
Smells good.  Use very little amount and works well.
"
"
Smells amazing. Did a ok job of defining my curls.
"
"
Like it
"
"
My hair hasn't looked this good in a long time. I actually have curls back in my hair after years of abuse! I will definitely be using this for now on! So glad I found it!!
"
"
Well I've bought this at a store for quite a bit more money, so I thought I'd save some and buy it on Amazon.  It works the same, which is great, for my curly hair.  However; it does not have the same wonderful coconut smell.  I wonder if the product is old?  Probably will not purchase here again.
"
"
Love this stuff. Good price!
"
"
Ok product. It did not work on my hair.
"
"
Great stuff, does define curl, one pump can be sometimes too thick though for my grade
"
"
Daughter loves it
"
"
DC products destroyed my hair and scalp. Please use caution if considering any DC products!
"
"
This product is great for creating curls that are soft and not crunchy or hard
"
"
Tried this product for 30 days, left my hair feeling lifeless and looking limp. Unable to return to seller due to 30 day return policy.  Wouldn't waist your money
"
"
This product leaves my hair so soft and it smells so good. I would definitely recommend and re-purchase
"
"
Too heavy for my curls
"
"
This was the only product of the brand that really help
"
"
This worked great on wirey gray hair. It was recommended by a friend and she was spot on. Worked both for air drying or use with heat tools ( once dry).
"
"
doesn't really work that well for my super curly hair
"
"
I was looking for a product that will give softness and moisture back to my curls and this is not the product for me.
"
"
This product burned my face and made my eyes swell shut. Wondering if I was sent a 3rd party knock-off. BEWARE!
"
"
Great moisturizing but can weight hair down if too much is used. I'm looking for volume so I'll keep using this until I find the right product that can do both!
"
"
Suuuuuuper thick. For my fine hair it's too much for me. The other cream works better for me. This smells 100% better though.
"
"
I've been using this product for 3 years now and the results on my curly hair are great. Is a must!
"
"
Best for curly hair
"
"
I like it. Defines curls. Dont put a lot
"
"
This product is awesome. It has a very nice coconut scent , and it leave my curls soft. The only downside of this product and any deva curl is that they are expensive
"
"
Keeps the frizz away and makes my curly hair manageable.
"
"
My curls have never looked better!  I'm always on the lookout for new products as most just don't cut it.  This product leaves them soft, defined, and bouncy, just the way I like them.
"
"
Love it! Super amazing product for girls with curly hair. It is more of a moisturizing product than one that holds the shape of the curl. I use it will a cream gel.
"
"
It’s my go to product.  I keep trying others that are cheaper but end up coming right back.  Love it
"
"
My curls still get frizzy and it doesn't do much to make my curls look nicer.
"
"
This is a great Deva product and works well alone or in combination with their B’leave in.
"
"
This is the best hair cream I have used. After applying this to my hair and letting it air dry (without touching) it makes my hair so soft and frizz-free. The smell is a plus too. I love the smell of coconuts. It has a hint of tanking oil too.. But in a light good way.
"
"
This doesn't really do anything to my wavy curls. Doesn't feel moisturizing at all. If anything it actually feels like it's drying my hair and frizzy. I've heard good things about Deva and wanted to try it out because I could never find any good products for my hair type. Guess I have to keep searching.
"
"
Great for moisturizing and soft curls.  I use it on damp and dry hair.
"
"
I already was a fan of Deva Curl products - I previously used the Deva Curl Style Cream (just the regular one) but I heard rave reviews about this Super Cream one so I decided to try it. My hair is more “wavy” than curly but I can usually get it to curl by scrunching away at it as it air dries or use a diffuser with my blow dryer.This morning I was pressed for time before work so I quickly ran this Super Cream through my hair and ran off. I randomly scrunched my hair as it air dried but not as much as I normally do. My pics aren’t the best quality due to lighting but you can see I have ringlets in my hair, which is a huge deal for me! And I barely did anything to it! I’m a believer and will surely buy more when I run out. Also, it smells divine!
"
"
Works great and doesn't take much to get the job done!
"
"
Great product for a great price
"
"
A great product to help prevent frizz and hold style for a wavy beach look.
"
"
It’s perfect on wild frizzy hair like I have.
"
"
its okay
"
"
Best product for curly hair, my wife's curls are awesome!
"
"
Love the cream. Have tried it before (in a previous sample I got directly from DevaCurl), and this is the same product. Will plan on purchasing again.
"
"
I use it everyday on my curly hair it is amazing as a detangler
"
"
Is so good that I ordered this twice
"
"
This is the only product that keeps my curly hair shiny, straight when I want it straight, and really healthy. Even in humid weather.
"
"
Received product broken. Top was broken and product was all over plastic bag. Huge disappointment and product can not be returned.
"
"
Love this stuff in combination with gel, makes for a wonderful hair day :)
"
"
I love this product, and have been using it for the last 6 months. Decided to order it here, and it arrived damaged with a no return policy.
"
"
I love all things Deva Curl. Curly hair is dry and Deva Curl products keep curly hair moisturized.
"
"
This product is amazing.  I love everything about it - the smell, the lightweight formula.  Nothing negative to report except that it's pricey and sometimes you may need a lot of product to reach the desired effect.  The good thing, though, is that sometimes you just need water on day two to revive the product.
"
"
My daughter love this whole line of products!
"
"
Keeps my curly hair from becoming frizzy!
"
"
I like the way it goes on a small amount goes a long way. It holds my curls without making my hair stiff

Just the best product for really dry curly hair. I love it!
"
"
My favorite curl cream! Soft and never crunchy!
"
"
Great
"
"
So far I love this!!!  really helps define my curls
"
"
Best thing since sliced bread.
"
"
For curly hair in humid climates- it's not an exclusive to my collection, but it's one I order often and it smells heavenly!
"
"
The cream is thick, I like how it works on my curls.
"
"
Great product, mild scents
"
"
I'm not a hair stylist and I seldom use hair products. But I have use other Deva Curl stuff that works better than this.
"
"
Love this product to help with frizz
"
"
This works so well on my sons hair!
"
"
It ok but my hair feels harsh
"
"
Defined bouncy curls, smells great, would recommend! Easy to use, damp hair scrunch hair upwards and vuala!
"
"
This bottle has been a game changer for me.  Instead of using 2 separate products, now I only use one and I love it!
"
"
This is my go-to for everyday use in my curly hair!
"
"
Love the product but..Unfortunately one full container arrived empty. Top was decapitated. I’m not sure how to navigate to get a replacement. Please assist
"
"
Love this product but bottle was busted on delivery and is not eligible for refund?
"
"
Might be great for other people, but it doesn't work as great for me. Definitely expected more. After I use the diffuser my hair is all frizzy.
"
"
Amazing product. Great for flyaways, refreshing curls between washes, and can use as styling cream. I have 3B curls and it does a great job of hydrating, without weighing down my curls. Worth every penny!
"
"
I love Deva curl, my waves are tamed & less frizzy.
"
"
Love devacurl products. I recommend getting a devacut if you’re a newbie to know how to get the most out of the products.
"
"
Smells good, great for styling but once I wash my hair it returns dry again!... I need something that keeps the moisture in all the time.. I like it but it's not for my hair type.. I'm having low porosity protein sensitive 3b/3c curly hair..
"
"
Seems to work
"
"
Really love this product for my 3b curls. Has great hold and smells good.
"
"
Great results! Keeps the frizz manageable without losing curl!!
"
"
great product
"
"
Great product
"
"
Love this stuff
"
"
Great curl cream - stays soft & supple, but prevents frizz.
"
"
GREAT PRODUCT
"
"
this product did not enhance my curls at all...just made my hair feel heavy and flat.
"
"
Really keeps my curls moisturized and shiny.
"
"
I was not very impressed with this product. It did not work the way the consultant who sold it to me said it would. I have very curly hair and need extra hold and this just did not seem to have the tight hold hold I was looking for
"
"
Love the smell! Be careful about the amount you use. Too much makes my hair look greasy.
"
"
I don't think that this is the actual product from Deva curl. my hair has been frizzy and weighed down since I started using this. My curls always looked gorgeous when I bought this from an actual salon.
"
"
This produce works wonders with my natural curly hair. Best produce I have found for my hair.
"
"
My hair looked frizzy and dry after using this product.
"
"
This cream is fantastic for my medium-curly hair. My hair holds still while still being soft and bouncy. The frizziness of my hair has also reduced, and it smells so nice
"
"
Product came with the top off s crime everywhere in box.  Can’t use product at all!
"
"
Nice product I love it
"
"
Delivered on time. Product works good.
"
"
My hair is fine, between a 4b and 4c, so the Deva curl Supercream is too much for my hair, I cannot use a lot, i have to either that or the Deva curl light defining gel.
"
"
I love this product, initially received a sample and really liked the way it left my hair. Not stiff, not greasy. Just the right amount of shine and left me with awesome ringlets.
"
"
This definitely doesn't compare to the rest of the deva line. I use the no poo, one conditioner, ultra defining gel and set it free. This product didn't curl my 3b-3c curls at all. It left a halo of frizz around my hair that I don't get with other hair cream I use. It smells good so I gave it a 2 star. I wasn't able to return this product so to use it up I add another gel product to it to give it more hold. It doesn't have enough hold using it alone. My go to hair cream that I apply after the ultra defining gel is Curls Rock. I know it's not sulfate free, but it works on my hair and that's all that matters.
"
"
Works wonderful for my hair, my hair stylist recommended it so i bought it on Amazon. Love it!
"
"
I love the way it makes my hair look!
"
"
Great styling, light not sticky
"
"
I love anything that smells like coconut, and so far Deva Curl's curl cream has been my favorite for air-drying my waves, so this was a must have for me!
"
"
Helps curls stay moist . Would give 5 stars. But a little pricey
"
"
The product arrived broken so I lost a quarter of such expensive cream. I haven't tried it yet.
"
"
Wrong item! I ordered super cream and received styling cream! And now I cannot return it??? Awful!
"
"
Ok
"
"
Awesome stuff
"
"
Wish I knew about this product long time ago.
"
"
Devacurl makes my hair very dry.. no matter the product it just does.
"
"
Like smell
"
"
My has been using the devaCurl products for over a year and love them.
"
"
Produces soft curls.  Downside, small amount for the money.
"
"
This smell is off. I don't think this is authentic divacurl. Unable to return. 0 stars
"
"
Nice product
"
"
My favorite cream for my 3C/4A curls!
"
"
You can use it for wet and dry hair and creates less frizziness and defines your curls. For wet hair divide ur hair in sections and put cream with your fingers. For dry hair i just put a small amount all over. I use this before using the devacurl gel.
"
"
Thicker then I thought it would be for my type of hair and leaves it a bit greasy.
"
"
Too heavy to use on fine hair.;This would be great for thicker and/or course hair.
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Love this product leave your hair smooth.
"
"
Best product I have ever used to take my frizzy curls!
"
"
Nothing beats the supercream!
"
"
Absolutely love this stuff! Works great to tame my wild hair!
"
"
This product works the best to keep my hair moisturized and not lose my curls.
"
"
I've been using this product for some time and I like it.  It's a little pricey though.
"
"
keeps my curls soft and can even use for second day curls. good product but due to the price i may find other alternatives. would like to try the shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
Great product. Makes for soft wavy hair
"
"
Heavy product to be used by itself. No curl definition but it does soften hair. Works good if you wear a fro. Too expensive.
"
"
This product is worth the investment.  Works well on my hair.
"
"
The best price for this product is here on amazon. This is my favorite hair product.
"
"
It leaves your hair feeling soft and theres barely any friz. For styling its great, the only thng is if you use it continously, like i do because i dont like washing my hair everyday, it leaves a weird smell in your hair if you use it a lot. Other than that i love it.
"
"
The product have coconut smell, the texture is very soft and that’s very nice for hair volume!
"
"
Ok, nothing special.
"
"
Makes great curls
"
"
Love so much. I use this with hair moose and love it so much. Amazing curls and super soft.
"
"
Best hair product I have used! It hold my fine wavy hair.
"
"
Yummy and coconut too! Makes a great curl!
"
"
Great product, good seller
"
"
I love this styler cream! It doesn't take much and my curls are shiny and defined.
"
"
Great product.  Quick delivery
"
"
one of my favorite devacurl products
"
"
Product is great, but it had exploded in the packaging. How can we get a new bottle that's full?
"
"
It enhanced curls but only after its been conditioned deeply
"
"
defined and balanced curls
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Not overly scented. Other Deva Curl products are too scenty. softens and holds curls in place.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Perfect for my curls makes them Soft, not stiff or sticky, yet bouncy. Rinses off easily.
"
"
Excelente mi cabello ama este producto
"
"
Like the texture soft
"
"
Great product. But I al allergic to it,
"
"
Curly hair
"
"
I think it’s fake to be honest.  Doesn’t have the same feel as the one I bought from a salon.  Very disappointing.
"
"
I love this product. I have thick natural curly hair and do not like to put products in it. But, this stuff doesn't make my hair feel crunchy. It defines my curls and keeps the frizz away.
"
"
Using it daily
"
"
Seen some difference in my curls. Good product.
"
"
Got this for my daughter's hair. It was a big improvement!
"
"
I have naturally curly hair, and this made it greasy and weighed down. Non-returnable, which makes it even better.
"
"
It works great in my hair!
"
"
Thought it would be a great product.  I suppose it comes down to individual hair types.
"
"
Nice
"
"
Great product for my fine curly hair.
"
"
Finally!  At least for now, I've found a curl line I really like. For me, the trick was to use the Decadence line. I started with the No Poo- rubbed a generous amount into my scalp only and allowed it to run thorough the rest of my hair when rinsing. Second, I used the One Conditon. I rinsed most of it out (using cool water) but let a small amount stay in. Lastly, I used a micro fiber towel- scrunching curls from the bottom up. Then I finger combed through the Supercream, scruched more with towel and let my hair air dry.I found I needed to use a little more cream on my frizzy fly always and little gray hairs that poke out- after it almost finished drying. I've attached photos so you can see results. Now I can embrace my curls!
"
"
Love Love Love!! Works great to keep my hair curly and not crunchy!
"
"
I LOVE THIS ITEAM GREAT FOR MY CURLS .....
"
"
Fantastic product! This is the best styling cream I've ever found for curly hair.
"
"
Dried my hair out
"
"
Horrible, does not softens the hair
"
"
I’m loving this for my naturally curly hair!
"
"
Finally found a product that works on my hair ❤️
"
"
My daughter's curly hair is absolutely loving this product!
"
"
devine
"
"
Good for taming frizzy hair.
"
"

Love the coconut smellDislike the greasy effect on my hair
"
"
ITEM CAME BROKEN!!! LID WAS BROKEN OFF IN BOX AND PRODUCT SPILLED EVERYWHERE!! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED
"
"
My favorite curl cream
"
"
Product was received with busted cap and not usable.  Would like to know how to receive a replacement.
"
"
I LOVE Supercream, it is perfect for my curl pattern.
"
"
My hairdresser uses this on my hair just love this product.
"
"
Does not make my curls nice at all. It made my hair dry and frizzy!
"
"
This didn't work for me. I have more fine hair so it was just way too heavy the gel was good though.
"
"
Makes my hair soft and my curls big
"
"
My VERY thick, curly hair LOVES this product!!!I mix a cocktail with my Deva Gel.So many compliments
"
"
I love it!
"
"
Its works great in my hair.
"
"
I absolutely love how this makes my hair curl. I love the way it smells and I would recemmend this product to all my curly friends!
"
"
Ordered this Deva product that I usually get at Ulta and it came so quickly and I love it.
"
"
The product was not great as described it didn’t define curls and made my hair more messy!
"
"
Did not control frizz...even in low humidity.
"
"
Great!
"
"
Love this stuff! My hair feels so soft and not crunchy.
"
"
Defines curls and prevents frizz
"
"
Love it and the way it boost my curls hair feels healthy
"
"
I've been looking to embrace the curly girl life for some time, and I finally bit the bullet to buy this cream (admittedly after Nathalie Emmanuel said this was her go-to). I. LOVE. IT. Smells great, but not tooooo fragrant.  Followed the directions and got great looking curls.I couldn't afford to splurge for the no-poo and conditioner, so just know this product still gives great curls without the other products!
"
"
love it.. Hair feels great!
"
"
They are two versions.  The Coconut works best for me. I use it on wet and dry hair.
"
"
This cream works better than their gel product. Great smelling too!
"
"
Item delivered as promised. I have curly hair and it works well without leaving hair feeling stiff
"
"
Holy grail product for my crazy hair
"
"
Nice enough product. Nice scent. Keeps the hair moist and ""silky"" but it doesn't seem to be helping my curl pattern much. The curls don't look ""big and voluptuous"" like I had hoped (the way one other product I've used has, can't remember the name right now) It could be used as a daily moisturiser however. But don't expect over the top amazing curls.
"
"
👍🏻 Amazing product
"
"
Smells like heaven and helps out my curls!
"
"
This product isn’t as good as the gels.
"
"
Excellent for curly hair.
"
"
I like the way it keeps my hair curly and it stays in the style I want
"
"
I love love this product!  I have really curly hair thatI straighten. This product keeps the frizz away from humid days.
"
"
It's just the old faithful product I've always used, at a very reasonable price. Thanks!
"
"
I love this product! Gave my hair amazing curl!
"
"
I usually do not write reviews but this product works very well on my biracial daughter's hair. I can't even count how many products I have bought to maintain her curls and frizz. Along with the No Poo Shampoo and the conditioner, all three products are amazing.
"
"
I absolutely love this product! Only thing is that I have 3B low porosity hair and my hair strands themselves are thick, m but I don’t have a lot of hair so it can get weighed down easily, so I have to use a little bit to get the best results. If I put a little too much, my hair is very weighed down and greasy looking. I like to use a leave in (sparingly) and then I use this product, then top it off with deva curl ultra defining gel and my curls are so defined without the frizz. I only use a little of each product, though, so my hair doesn’t get weighed down. It just depends on your hair type. Someone with a lot more hair that is thicker and high porosity would definitely benefit more, but I still love this product and it still does wonders for my curls.
"
"
My natural curly hair. It keeps it more manageable
"
"
It is not working on my curly hair! Can't return it either!
"
"
Not as effective on frizz aS I hoped.
"
"
I love this product.
"
"
Not good for Intended use
"
"
This is better than the cream I got.
"
"
Smells greAt but left my hair feeling a little dry
"
"
Awesome product!!
"
"
Worst product.I do not recommend, it left my hair really greasy
"
"
Gives beautiful  ringlets and tames the frizz.
"
"
love it!  I don't need to add additional styling products after using this curl cream and it's not too heavy and not greasy.
"
"
This product did not keep my daughter's hair moist at all. I love the shampoo and conditioner but have no use for this product
"
"
Makes my hair so soft! Smells so good!
"
"
I love this!
"
"
I purchased this for my daughter to use as an everyday product for natural hair and twist.it's a little expensive but I plan to purchase more if discount is available
"
"
This is the best product for soft effortless curls. I lOVE it
"
"
great product
"
"
Great stuff and great smell.
"
"
Great product. Not too heavy or sticky
"
"
I first received this curl cream as a free sample with a beauty purchase and instantly fell in love with the coconut scent. I was hesitant to purchase the full sized bottle because of the price.. but it really is one of the better styling products I've come across. I have naturally thick curly hair (type 2C/3A). I pump a couple squirts in my palms, rub together, and gently run my fingers through wet hair.. scrunching and twirling the ends.. works great. It dries less frizzy, defined curls, and smelling great. To prevent that ""greasy"" look...I do try to keep the cream concentrated near the lower half and ends because my scalp can get oily through out the day.
"
"
Love the curls it gives my hair !
"
"
Works amazingly well on my kinky crazy hair and it smells wonderful!!
"
"
Great for defining curls
"
"
This product does not work as indicated. I will never buy this again.
"
"
Simply the best style product for curls.
"
"
Smells great, nice and nourishing or my dry curly hair.
"
"
No crunchy curls with Deva Curl. Their products are go to for my coarse, curly hair.
"
"
I love this product.  It has managing my hair so much easier.
"
"
Natural product makes hair soft.
"
"
Soft curls
"
"
This really helps my curls stay soft and frizz free.
"
"
Did not work well on my natural hair.
"
"
Love it!! The best cream ever!! Really supercream!!
"
"
good product.Great price.
"
"
Great product but this how it was delivered to me.
"
"
Perfect for natural curly hair, I just love it! Moisturises perfectly, doesn't make hair bulky. I need a really little amount to apply for a medium length hair.
"
"
Use sparingly!
"
"
Love it!!! Leaves my curls soft and smooth and it smells great!!!
"
"
I can tell it keeps my hair from being as frizzy but it also makes it oily with even the smallest amount (I don't use it on my roots and only use a dab). I, also, don't think my hair is curly enough for it. It borders between wavy and curly but I can see where it would work well on super curly hair. I'll probably end up returning it...
"
"
Still a fantastic product!  Recommended to anyone with hair.
"
"
His curl cream did not live up to the advertised hype for me. I have curly-kinky hair and wanted to like this project but it did not do much for my wash and go style. It takes a considerable amount of this product to provide hold and the overall effect was just ok.
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Bought this many times - combined with the devacurl gel it's the best thing for curls. Much cheaper than it costs at salons, although still think it should cost less !
"
"
Awesome stuff for curly hair
"
"
I have  naturally curly hair and this product rocked my curls!
"
"
I absolutely love using this product not to heavy for my hair and it makes my curls pop.
"
"
Terrible product. Dried out my beautiful curls and weight it down.  The worst part is the seller does not accept returns.  I feel robbed.
"
"
I got super cream damaged and broken
"
"
Finally a product that defines my curls without weighing them down.. has a pleasant light smell and doesn’t take much even for thick curls!
"
"
This product seems, at first pump from the container, that it might be a very heavy styling cream. It is not - it is very light and smells like coconut! I love it!
"
"
Love this product.  Just a dab will do you!
"
"
Would only purchase on payday when I feel confident.
"
"
Like the way it keep my curls and smell good.
"
"
Great Deva product! And nice to have for Day 3.
"
"
I don't like how this made my hair feel.
"
"
Great product.  Is great with gel.
"
"
This cream is everything it promises, super moisterizing
"
"
I have very long (nearly to my bottom) very thick 2b/2c curls in south Florida. I use DevaCare no poo and conditioner, as well as the ultra defining gel. Usually for a leave-in conditioner, I use Eden All Natural Curl Defining Creme and it comes out fairly well, but I was unhappy with my definition in the front and overall frizziness. I tried this product in the winter time, so I had experience with its performance in cool (50-70 degree) weather without much humidity. I am not impressed, especially at this price point. I was expecting a rich cream that would spread through my hair, but what I got was a thin (thinner than my conditioner) light product that was gone in a matter of weeks. For $20 a bottle, this is not acceptable to me. I far prefer the Eden creme, which is thicker and provides much more definition. The DevaCurl SuperCream left my hair shiny and soft, but frizzy and undefined. I have recently discovered Queen Helene Royal Curl Shaping Cream, which is really more of a light gel in consistency. I tried it without the Eden product and it was an awful sticky mess, but combining the two has given me the best hair of my life! I highly recommend trying these products with the DevaCare No Poo/Conditioner and DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel if your hair is prone to dryness and needs a lot of help to hold its curl (i.e. without product you have a mass of frizzy hair with no defined curls -- in fact, it doesn't really even look curly except for the bottom ringlets). Also, sealing your ends with a little coconut oil melted between your palms will keep them from falling apart.
"
"
helped take frizz and define curls
"
"
Smells good.
"
"
Not great for my type of hair...
"
"
Strong product. Great price vs store — nearly 1/3 cost!
"
"
Used it this morning...so far so good!
"
"
Best product I’ve used on my hair.
"
"
Got curly hair, want ringlets, this is awesome stuff! Love it!! Started with a trial size, just amazing. (Do hair while wet)
"
"
Great product.
"
"
I love this cream. It is lightweight and your curls pop immediately.
"
"
Love the product. Feels great
"
"
didn't do anything
"
"
GreT stuff really helped my hair
"
"
smells awesome
"
"
perfect love it
"
"
This just made my hair feel sticky and stiff. I do not recommend this product at all!!!
"
"
Love this product for my wavy hair
"
"
One of my favorite products! Gives great curl definition while keeping them soft and bouncy.
"
"
This smells great and works great. I am caucasian, with long, very curly but not super thick hair.  If I am air drying and leaving it as natural curly then I spread just a little bit (dime sized drop) through my damp hair and let it dry. Curls are soft and not frizzy.  The weight is just right- my hair does not look limp, but does not puff up either. I also successfully use this when I blow dry my hair straight. I smooth a tiny bit on my hair once I am done drying. No frizz, just soft, straight hair.  It is not sticky or stiff in any way.Love this stuff!
"
"
This product is the best curly hair product I have ever used!!!
"
"
Love this product, light weight
"
"
Product was as listed and works well on my curly hair. It was delivered on time - sooner than expected!
"
"
I love all Deva!!!
"
"
I love this product. It smells like coconuts and defines my long, curly hair. I recommend this product and plan to repurchase in the future.
"
"
Really helps my curls!
"
"
Thick goop that tames the frizzies and flyaways while facilitating the curl. Love the yummy coconut scent.
"
"
Excellent product for Curly hair.  I'll never use anything else!
"
"
Best product ever! My hair is course and frizzy and this product tames and controls leaving my curls bouncy. The smell is amazing too!
"
"
I was looking for something to enhance my curls, and this did the exact opposite. It flattened them out and made them more waves than curls.
"
"
Bottle was damaged and leaked.
"
"
defines my curls and when using this with the ultra defining gel, my curls are rocking all day long
"
"
Product is good but my bottle came with a big inside.
"
"
Recieved broken
"
"
Love this stuff.
"
"
Heavy for soft curls but still a good product
"
"
RECEIVED AS PROMISED!
"
"
Takes away the fuzz!
"
"
I loved this cream & what it did for my hair, I have naturally curly hair and I had lost the curl but got it back with deva curl. For me best results is let air dry.
"
"
Always arrives on time and is exactly what I ordered. Great for curly hair without making hair crunchy.
"
"
Exactly as shown in the description amazing !!
"
"
Smells and feel amazing in hair!
"
"
Good product not heavy
"
"
Other products I use work just as good. Left a lot  of residue on my hair.  My stylist noticed immediately.
"
"
The lid was open and I can not open to correct. If anything is left.
"
"
Light and gentle on my curls. Will definitely buy again
"
"
too thick, weighs hair downnot a fan of coconut smell- and its strong
"
"
Smells great and keeps hair soft but did not hold my curls and make my hair frizzy. Not worth the price
"
"
ONE OF MY FAVORITE CURLEY HAIR PRODUCTS
"
"
Leaves my curls too soft...it doesn't have enough hold for my liking. The smell is nice, though.
"
"
Didn't do anything for my curls. Doesn't work at all for me.
"
"
Made my curls amazing! I am now confident to wear my curls and not straighten my hair!
"
"
good
"
"
This product is just really calms the hair down. This product is good for styling,twist outs , and dry hair.
"
"
Purchased for my daughter
"
"
Better than previous product. I was afraid it might be odorific but it isn't. Definitely will buy again
"
"
Quick delivery. Just what I expected!
"
"
not great for thin hair
"
"
Love this stuff! Leaves hair feeling really soft, and without residue:)
"
"
Not enough hold for my curls which can get a bit frizzy if not whipped into shape enough
"
"
Love the products!
"
"
Great product for 3c curls!
"
"
I received an empty box. Yes...a completely empty box
"
"
Amazing!!! The best frizz control I've ever had (and I've tried lots of them). Leaves my curls soft, not hard and crunchy. Great fragrance.I just use this and Mr. Right and I'm done. In the summer I suspect I will have to use some gel but can't help that because I've got very frizzy hair. Still, better than the four products I was using and still got frizz.
"
"
Best curling styler by far, I have just used it once and I know each time my hair will look better and better.
"
"
Very happy with my purchase
"
"
I am not the type of person to write reviews I actually never have but I have been looking for a product to make my curly frizzy crazy hair look decent by just putting it on my hair right after I wash my hair at home. And this is it. I will be ordering this product all the time. Super happy. I am Dominican and always struggle with my hair. I have been straightening it for as long as I can remember because I hated how it looked curly. Not anymore! 😌
"
"
I am loving my product, as well as my results. deva curls will be my new products from here and out.
"
"
Love the product, it leaves my hair silky and I can run my fingers through it.
"
"
Not great on hold, but awesome for moisture and definition when applying to wet hair. Also great for redefining dry cruls.
"
"
Works really well.  I use one part Deva Curl Supercream and two parts ArcAngel to tame my 3b curly hair.  I have used Deva Curl products for a long time (with occasional attempts at other products).  I have always come back to ArcAngel, which I prefer over the Ultra gel.
"
"
I love this!
"
"
While I prefer their gel, this curl styler actually moisturizes.  My curls were very soft.  It does make your hair heavier therefore it takes longer to dry as opposed to the gel is more lightweight.  But I break this cream out when my hair needs a little more TLC.

This is by far the best styling cream I've used for curly hair, and it has a very, very light coconut scent.  My suggestion is to use Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam first.  What I find most effective is to use Frizz-Free in the shower.  When your conditioner is still in, comb through your hair.  Rinse out the conditioner, then bend your head so the hair falls in front of you, and while wet, pump the Frizz-Free into your hands, and scrunch into your hair, starting at the ends.  Then gently wrap hair in a towel for 5 minutes.  Unwrap hair, and put into place with fingers.  That is when I use a few pumps of the Supercream, throughout hair.  Then let dry naturally.  Another trick is to NOT touch it until it is completely dry; this helps make it frizz resistant.  When totally dry, bend head forward, and gently fluff hair until it's as full as you want.  It leaves my long and full hair shiny, curly, and mostly frizz free.  The best combo ever!

Love this product! I wash my hair, apply the product (a little goes a long way), plop my hair, take it down and go! This product makes my curls bouncy and beautiful! LOVE…LOVE…LOVE!The only problem I had was that they put a label over the directions! It took me forever to peel the label off!
"
"
Good not great.

"
I love this product, it really saved my life and hair. :)

Best stuff

I have to start by saying I hate curl creams with a passion. They frizz out my hair and provide zero definition. However, rec'd this as a sample from Sephora and tried it.  First used without anything else, not super frizzy, but not enough definition and hold.  Decided to try mixing it with Pattern Pusha from Curl Junky and together they make magic for my 3a/3b curls.  Would recommend this, with the caveat that you also may need to mix it with something else.
"
"
As a follower of the curly girl method, this is my Holy Grail product. I have not been able to find a curl cream that works as well as this one. I have shoulder length 2c/3a curls with low porosity and one or two pumps of this is perfect to keep my curls hydrated but not weighed down. A lot of Devacurl products are overrated and not worth the money in my opinion, but this is not one of them.
"
"
This stuff is awesome!  I LOVE it for my daughter's hair!!!
"
"
I love the original curl cream with all of my heart.  This stuff, not so much. It didn't define my curls well or control my frizz. But, It smells nice and leaves your hair soft.  It's just not the right product for me.  I'll stick with the original curl cream.  For reference, my hair is a 50/50 mix of corckscrews and s-type curls that are prone to insane levels of frizz.
"
"
Love this product!!!
"
"
Great product! I order this on a regular basis
"
"
My curls love this product.
"
"
Great product!

Looooove the coconut cream

I used to use the DevaCurl Light Defining Gel; then at a certain point I ran out and it was an emergency and I bought a competing brand -- big mistake! It was awful! So I went back to the DevaCurl, and then my hair stylist recommended I use this Coconut Curl Styler in combination with the gel. I loved it!  It made my hair much softer, while still retaining the curl shape. I was using half and half mixed together before even getting out of the shower, when my hair is still quite wet.When I ran out of the gel again, I tried the cream alone -- and I love it even more! Not only my hair is nice and sot, but it also takes less long to dry -- the cream is less crisp and I suppose gets absorbed into the hair more rather than staying on top of it, which I think allows it to dry faster. Just my theory. Anyway, I will make sure I never run out again!
"
"
It works great for my mixed 3c, with some 4a hair.
"
"
product review this is a great product but I just received it today and opened it and the bottles broke. disappointed :(
"
"
Styles, keeps your hair soft
"
"
I read so many reviews before spending this much on a hair product and had high hopes but this does NOTHING for my thick, wavy hair.
"
"
I just love how soft my curls are and the smell is great!
"
"
I love this product it keeps the frizz down and smells amazing.
"
"
AMAZING PRODUCT!! Literally a life saver for my curly hair.
"
"
I love this product.  It defines my curls and doesn't weigh down my fine hair at all.
"
"
I never seen a good product like ""DEVA""👍
"
"
GREAT curl product. Smells amazing, and forms my curl pattern the same almost every time without feeling sticky or weighted. Between this and another brand's 'secret weapon' cream - my curls always look great!
"
"
Awesome product!!!  I recommend this to anyone that has curly hair❤️❤️❤️
"
"
works great and dryout your hair
"
"
It's excellent!
"
"
Product works great.
"

Good product

It smells really good and leave hair hydrated.
"

Yes
"
"
Great product
"

I have extremely curly, frizzy hair and have tried so many different products to attempt to manage it that I lost count a long time ago. This product is by far THE BEST that I have ever used!  I brings out soft beautiful curls that I never knew I had!  The cream has a light pleasant smell and doesn't make my hair ""crunchy"".  It even works well to revitalize my curls the next day (I can't wash it every day or it becomes too dry).  I am so happy that this was recommended to me!
"
"
I love this stuff and was happy to find it cheaper here than it was at Ulta!It smells SO good!
"
"
I have had naturally curry hair all of my life.  My stylist recommended this product to me and it really helps control the texture and frizz without making my hair feel crunchy.
"
"
Amazing products
"
"
Good product but I think I would just stick to buying my 8.99 product from the store since it created th same effect on my hair. No complaints I just think I can save money.
"
"
More appropriately, my wife loves it. I don't use it, but she raves about how well it works. And her hair does remain quite curley, which is a great look for her.
"
"
I purchased this Deva supercream and when I opened the package the top had been completely broken off from the base.
"
"
Amazing! I have never been able to find anything for my hair that makes it soft, not crunchy! I can still touch it without it frizzing.
"
"
I don't really care for it but I know a lot of people who love it.  It smells great and makes your hair really soft.  But its hard to sale my hair when i use it.
"
"
My hair smells amazing and my curls are alot less frizzy. However, it is not a miracle product and is awfully expensive not to be.
"
"
Item arrived completely spilled in an envelope and the container was broken in two. Completely useless, I had to throw everything out. What a waste of time and money!!!
"
"
I am a monthly subscriber box junkie and I received a sample of this in one of them and fell in love! It smells amazing first off. Not the typical DevaCurl smell that all the other products have, which I like a lot b/c I really hate that smell. This stuff is thick but absorbent so no white streaks left in your hair you need to rub away. A little goes a long way, but even if you used too much, it's not as detrimental as some other leave in products. Tames my frizz and sculpts my curls, even if it's the only product I use that day.
"
"
Great cream...but i hate coconut smell.. i will not buy it again just because of the smell...
"
"

"
"
Happy with this product. Smells good, hair is moisturized and does not feel heavy on your hair.
"
"
Not too sure if I love this product yet. I do prefer using organic virgin coconut oil instead as it curls and defines better than this product. Plus I don't understand how this is good for your hair when it list a million ingredients that I can't pronounce.
"
"
Product arrived promptly.  I thought it was fine, but nothing extraordinary.
"
"
Too heavy on my hair, not a great product this time around.
"
"
For my daughter but she loves it.
"
"
Meh. Would not buy again.
"
"
Makes my hair so soft!! I use it as a leave in conditioner.
"
"
moisturizing great for natural hair
"
"
Great texture and scent.
"
"
Didn’t work and can not return or get refund for product. I do not recommend this product. In fact I think Amazon should not let it be sold on their site.
"
"
a little heavy for my hair. love the smell.
"
"
Great for curly hair, I don't have to use hairspray or gel, just this.
"
"
I was not able to use this product, when the package arrived the content was spilled all over the box, the bottle seam to be of poor quality.
"
"
Product arrived broken :-(
"
"
This cream is amazing!!!
"
"

"
"
Does not hold my curls. Worthless.
"
"
The leave in devacurl works much better for my hair but love the products in general...
"
"
Everyone's hair is different.My hair loves this!!
"
"
perfect for my curly hair and the smell is devine!
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Not for thick hair!! You need to put a lot on!
"
"
Works well, bit on the pricey side
"
"
A bit heavy....
"
"
Delivered as expected
"
"
Love, love this product!  Never had anything work so well.
"
"
It gave me beautiful curls without frizz.
"
"
I use this in my kinky, wavy, fine, dense hair and it works. This is a perfect light yet moisturized styler for my hair.
"
"
I have fallen in LOVE with this stuff! I have what is considered unruly 3b curls. My 3 year old daughter has combination 3c/4a and the super cream works really well for both of us. I really like that our curls have definition while feeling super soft and touchable. This is our new go to styling product.
"
"
Good
"
"
Love this product but might just have to buy it in stores I recieved my product with no cap and the package covered in product!!! So disappointed!
"
"
Product arrived exploded.
"
"
Just what I needed.
"
"
Bottles came damaged, product was leaked in packaging.
"
"
My daughter has curly hair and this literally made her beautiful curls look terrible. Maybe is for kids that have a little wave to it but I would not recommend this product her curl had shrinkage it was a waste of $$ now I sure should had stayed using my original product that I but this was recommended by a hair stylist and the worst.
"
"
Item leaked in transit. The top is completely off and the cream is everywhere. Very disappointed.
"
"
I usually never write reviews, but this really pissed me off.  I was skeptical at first to order this product given that most of the reviews said their bottles opened inside packaging. I was scared that would happen to me, but I went ahead and ordered it because of the good reviews it has. Unfortunately, all the product spilled and the packaging was ripped from the bottom. This isnt what I payed for.
"
"
Product came in damaged and leaking
"
"
These babies absolutely SUCK to break in but they are worth every penny. Just keep wearing them, they will eventually soften and be more comfortable. Def worth it.
"
"
This product came in completely damaged
"
"
BEST PRODUCT IVE TRIED! I looooove this stuff it kept my curls so moisturized and it didn't weigh my hair down which happens really easily for me with other products . I always reccomend this product to other people !
"
"
The product arrived late, the cap was open and broken.
"
"
...and yet I'm giving this product 5 stars because it's magical.  You put it in your hair, slip your curls through your fingers to spread it around, then style it and run.  I have extremely porous, coarse 3c curls that pretty much reject just about every product out there, and this stuff works for me.But seriously Devacurl, could you PLEASE go back to breaking my lifelong imprisonment in coconut-scented products?  I was so happy when I realized none of your products smelled like that.
"
"
I got one of the free testers of this product from the DevaCurl site directly. This stuff works! And you don't even have to use that much. I have 4a,b and some c hair. Once you learn that your hair does not need to oily all day long to be healthy and hydrated. You learn you don't need so much product. My hair loves this stuff. The only draw back is that you are spending like $5 or $6 per oz and you only get 5.1 of them. :(
"
"
This is some good stuff! For a long time, I've used mousse on my hair, but have grown tired of the crunchy curls. I never thought I could stray from it, though, because anything else just left my curls a frizzy, undefined mess. I started using Bed Head Curls Rock Amplifier, which I found to be relatively sufficient. Then I gave Deva Curl Supercream a try, and I really liked it. I began using it exclusively, even though I didn't think it was a huge difference from Curls Rock. I just recently ran out, of Deva Curl, and went back to Curls Rock. Wow, could I tell the difference immediately! I have super thick hair and three small kids, so I never take the time to diffuse or dry my hair - it's air dry all the way. When I got home from work after going back to Curls Rock, I was embarrassed to look in the mirror and see how frizzy and blah my hair looked. I am officially a Supercream convert, and am going back to it, even though I still have two almost-full bottles of Curls Rock. The Curls Rock will be relegated to emergencies only, and DC Supercream will be my go-to from now on!

I received this product for Christmas in addition to the Decadence No-poo and Conditioner.  I have been on the Deva Curl train for about a year now and my typical product of choice is the gel but thought I'd give this a chance.  If I'm simply judging based on the performance, it would earn 5 stars: gives my curls excellent definition but required quite a bit to get through all of my thick hair but did a really good job. The one thing that turned this into an automatic ""absolutely never again"" for me was the scent it left on my hair once dry.  My hair smelled like vomit. This has not been a one time occurrence either, despite several tries, it continued to leave the putrid scent in my hair until washing.Never again will I purchase this.
"
"
I like this product, but, for me, it isn't the holy grail. I have high porosity 3a-3b hair, and it seems to moisturize it and all, but it didn't give me amazing definition. That thing where I've got a couple curly pieces and a couple oddly straight frizzy pieces seems to be happening, which I don't love. I think if I were to use in combination with another product, it might work better for me, but so far... eh.I think in the future I'll go back to Shea Moisture's Curl Enhancing Smoothie, it just works better for me, and for half the price, and double the amount!
"
"
I was excited to try this product, however it is just not for me.  I have thick hair with medium-loose curls.  This product makes my hair appear very dull.  When I use a small amount it doesn't seem to do anything, when I used more is weighted down my curls.  It did not define my curls at all.  My hair looks better using nothing at all.
"
"
As a life long curly headed girl I have struggled finding products that help smooth my curls and keep them bouncy- this product does just that and is awesome! I've used it for about a year now and will never go back!
"
"
Recomendado totalmente. Me encanta
"
"
This works great on curly hair that has been relaxed/straightened as well.My hair is relaxed, but my roommate's hair is natural. I had to do a job interview and was looking for something to smooth my hair into a bun. She gave me a few pumps of this and i've been hooked ever since.2018 UPDATE: Currently natural - Type 4B, med density, low porosity curls - this works great on my natural hair as well. I apply the product while my hair is damp then seal with oil.
"
"
I absolutely love this product. I was a bit reluctant to try it because I haven't seen a lot of reviews on it from women with 4c hair. I heard that it was for coarse hair, so I decided to try it. I'm so happy that I did. It smells amazing, it instantly softens my hair leaving it very moisturized. This is the second product that I've found to give me moisture retention.
"
"
Aaaah! Why’s this product so popular they’re expensive and all around suckyThis cream leaves so much build up in your hair and makes hair look dirty!
"
"
I wanted to try a twist out but was wary of purchasing this as my hair generally reacts badly to any oil based products. I have weird 3b/3c hair that only seems to respond well to water based products. I online chatted with Deva Curl and they recommended I try it even after I described my problem. I use their other products with great success so i tried it and, of course, it sucked on my hair. Makes my hair lank, greasy, sticky and frizzy even in small amounts. A twist out using One Condition produced a much better result. A shame as all my other Deva products rock. Anyone want to swap my barely used Supercream for Light Defining Gel or One Condition, lol?
"
"
Well am in love with Deva curl line they make my curl looks fresh and my hair do look as twice big than it is actually , it just I didn't understand why the coconut cream didn't fit in with my hair I used Deva curl regular cream and it was awesome actually it was the reason why I dumped out all my old stuff and used this line .... I guess it's my hair or we are different but if u faced this don't give up on this line just try Thier other stuff they Rock xx
"
"
Smells great and does not dry out hair
"
"
Finally a grease free and light formula  that's long lasting.
"
"
Smells amazing and does its job :)

As with all DevCurl products I've tried, while this product is amazing those of us with with very thick, kinky, coily, Afro hair will find themselves wanting if attempting to use this product alone. Depending on the level of definition you are going for, I recommend cocktailing this and a few other DevaCurl products for extra definition, hold, and longevity.The formulation is extremely thick and creamy, but magically lightweight. I purchased this product on July 2nd, 2017 and ran out about two weeks ago, so it lasted a long time even in my extremely thick hair (and I'm very heavy handed with products) It absorbed easily into my hair as opposed to simply laying on top of it. The smell is divine, and it provides excellent slip for detangling. The reason why I prefer this styling cream over others is because it is buildable- meaning that you can add more and more product as the week progresses without worrying about white flakes and product buildup. Even if my twists are white and frothy with product I can take them down the next morning without any flakes or white residue.I love this product, just not by itself. Why? Because alone it does not provide me with perfect, long lasting, frizz-free definition. Because of the curliness of my hair, I need something a little extra to cause my hair to clump and stay clumped throught the week, and for that I use a blend of plain 'ole shea butter and DevaCurl Beautiful Mess pomade. If I just use this and no other product, my intial curls will be clumped and pretty, however once they are dry and I go to take down my twists they end up frizzier than I would like.This product provides the most definition I've ever experienced and I've tried many natural products on the market, including Shea Moist*re Curl Enhancing Smoothie, Carol's Daughter Hair Milk & Margurite's Magic, and Cantu Coconut Cream, just to name a few.This is a great styling product that adds both high-levels of moisture and great definition. Just don't think you can use it alone and achieve that goddess-like definition we all want!

These products are AMAZING. My daughter (12) has unruly frizzy curls. Some strands are curlier than others so it's prone to dred overnight. We've tried expensive shampoos and conditioners, we've tried moisturizing treatments, we've tried countless creams, styling products, leave-in conditioners, and special combs. Her hair was always a frizzy mess. I bought the no-poo wash and the conditioner as well as this cream about two weeks ago.I cannot stop telling people how amazing it is. The two photos don't do the before/after comparison justice. Her hair has caused tears and fights because it's been hard to manage. With these products, her hair is beautiful and manageable. The after photo was taken after she got out of the pool and gave it a quick brush. She last used the cream two days ago and it's still working.I'm not a paid advertiser. I bought these products at Ulta after reaching the end of my rope. They work. They are amazing. I am a happy mom with a VERY relieved pre-teen. It is so worth the price.
"
"
OMG! I used this as my Styler a couple days ago for a wash-n-go. I used the No Poo Shampoo and the Deva One Conditioner and rinsed it out. I applied the SuperCream to my hair in sections using the 'praying hands' method and let it air dry. You talk about CURL DEFINITION for the GAWDS!!!! LOVE THIS STUFF!!! I I'll admit, it's a bit pricey to make this my staple holy trinity, but with results like these...I might have to reconsider.
"
"
AMAZING!! While this is cheaper on amazon, I found it for half this price at a local professional supply chain. If you have fine wavy hair less is more, sometimes I end up with weighed down curls because I used too much product
"
"
I've been using this product along with other DevaCurl products for about a year now, and I can finally post an honest review of use over time.Like many other women with curly hair, I spent years of my life fighting my hair on a daily basis, getting it chemically straightened and relaxed, and constantly heat styling and otherwise destroying my hair. It's a painful and often fruitless battle - which is why I made the decision to cut off the bottom six inches of hair, and start again from scratch, this time with no hair products but those I researched extensively as being good for curly, fine hair.When I did my research, the DevaCurl brand came up again and again - and I was skeptical. Its high price and cult following made me quite suspicious, but after a few months of using ineffective products, I decided to jump the gun and spring for the most ""basic"" product in their line - this Devacurl Supercream. It works a little like a leave-in conditioner - after you get out of the shower, before your hair is dry, you work this product gently through and either air-dry or blow-dry with a diffuser. It moisturizes and forms curls together without leaving a crunch residue, leaves your hair healthy and full of volume, and is overall just a fabulous product.Before using this cream, for work, I would ALWAYS wear my hair slicked back and up, because poodle hair isn't exactly professional. Getting out of bed and running without touching my hair was a pipe dream, and something I never imagined would be an option for me. But this product turns dried-out, wonky hair into perfectly formed, frizz-free spirals! If they need to stay, I also use DevaCurl's spray gel, but for the most part this is the ONLY after-washing hair product I use - and it's wonderful. I cannot recommend it enough!
"
"
Alrighty so I wrote a review on the conditioner and no poo shampoo in the decadence line and posted a photo of my hair using the product line. I used this in the photo of my sytled hair. I wash my hair with the no poo and use the conditioner as a leave in then put two pumps of this cream in my hair and let it air dry. I love the results. I did purchase the cream directly from the manufacturing company's website though because at the time amazon dint sale this decadence line just yet. I'll post the pictures of my bottle of cream and of my hair natural.

I have been a loyal Deva Curl client for five years! I loved their products, techniques, and even get the DevaCut. I used to love how my hair looked and felt with the products. Even when the change of ownership came and their products started to get marked up, I figured it’s still worth it. Then, for the past few months especially, I’ve noticed changes in my hair and scalp. I had been using the same products for years, no-poo shampoo, one condition, styling cream, believe-in, and ultra defining gel or the arc-angel gel. However, my scalp became itchier and itchier, dryer and dryer, and now I have dandruff I can’t get rid of. What’s worse, is my hair! It became dryer and coarser. The worse it got the more products I used and the more I washed it. I tried different techniques and brushing it differently. Always slept with a silk pillowcase AND silk bonnet. Then I figured I should get DevaCurl’s Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask. It just made things worse. My hair shed to new extremes, making my hair look flat and thin, my scalp got worse with dry patches that felt tight and hard. My hair was so dry and coarse even after washing my hair, at the end of the day it was matted. Keep in mind I have 3A/B curls, it takes quite a bit to have it matted. not tangled, MATTED. Which of corse meant I had to wash it more, and brushing through it made it fall out more! My curls werent taking shape like they used to. My curls looked more like matted, dry, haystacks that slightly waved. My scalp became sensitive to brushing, it was a nightmare! I stopped using DevaCurl in just a week and I’ve noticed a huge difference already. My curls haven’t fully recovered, but I’m hopeful they will. I will not buy DevaCurl again unless they address this and change to fix the issue. So disappointed, five years of spending money one overpriced products and this is how they repay me. I honestly just want them to go back to how they used to be. Now I have to warn everybody I’ve been recommending this product to for the past five years.

This is a serious game-changer for anyone with curly hair and it smells like a beach vacation! I have medium-length Type 3A Curls and this is now the first product I start with right out of the shower. I cannot say enough good things about this product - it doesn't weigh my hair down, it's not too oily, it's not too light, it adds just enough moisture to define my curls, and did I mention that it smells like a beach vacation?How I use it:  As soon as I get out of the shower, I press my hair with a Turbie Twist (microfiber towel) to remove excess water. Then I use my fingers like a comb (I never use a brush and if you have curly hair, I don't recommend you do either). Directly after this, I use 1.5 pumps of the Deva Curl Supercream Coconut Curl Styler Cream and distribute throughout my hair (starting at the ends). Then I use my Turbie Twist to ""scrunch"" my hair and let it air dry for 15 minutes. After that, I use a diffuser (I currently have the Deva Curl diffuser that looks like a hand) until my hair is 80-90% dry. After I let it air dry a little bit more, I use a small amount of Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Style Milk to tame any frizz and to add to the curl definition.
"
"
My hair is extremely thick, and naturally curly. I have used many curl creams in the past that make my hair crispy in the end. This makes your curls feel like FEATHERS. It defines them, keeps them SUPER light weight, and smells absolutely amazing. I wish I would have found this product years ago. By far the absolute best curl activator I have ever used in my life. My mom is a cosmetologist for reference, and I have used many professional products and nothing compares to this even slightly. You have to use it on REALLY wet hair. Like almost dripping. I use the praying method (YouTube that) to put it on. And I use 2 quarter sized piles of this. I then use a diffuser on low and BAM.
"
"
We LOVE this product!! There are 4 curly girlies in our house and this stuff is awesome! I like it much better than the regular cream and love the coconut scent!
"
"
All I can say is the packaging really lacked any thought. A complete disappointment to find it was shipped in what amounted to a cardboard envelope. No surprise the container lid was popped open and goop all over the inside of the package. Should I be surprised this item is also not eligible for return or replacement? Out of curiosity I used a silicon scraper to collect all the material off the inside of the package and put it with the bottle contents on the scale. Just over 2.75oz. Almost exactly half of what the bottle says it contains. Now the price makes sense... I wish there was some way to buy things like this through Amazon with confidence your getting the actual, unaltered product.
"
"
I absolutely love this product!I’m white (I feel this is important for hair texture purpose - I was nervous at first that this product could be geared toward ethnic hair & too heavy for my hair) and my hair is down to my mid back when straight - with this product it is probably a solid 4 inches shorter so it really developed my curlsIt does NOT leave my hair “crunchy” like moose doesI can wake up on day 2 or 3 and spritz it with some water - maybe hit it with the diffuser & it looks great again!I use this with It’s a 10 & biosilk serumI’ve never been able to wear my hair natural more than 1 day before this product - considering I color my hair red, it’s really important I can go multiple days without a washHope this helps!
"
"
I have spent the last year trying out different curly hair styling products, and DevaCurl SuperCream is possibly my favorite of them all. I have a mix of low-porosity 3A/3B curls, and this cream is perfect. It hydrates my hair, smooths frizz, and has the perfect amount of hold without making my hair feel crunchy or weighed down. I apply this cream using the praying hands method, then distribute it using a Denman brush (seriously buy one of these - they are amazing and perfect for creating buoyant, even curls) and scrunch out excess moisture/product with a microfiber towel. This cream also can be applied to damp/somewhat dry hair to refresh day 2+ curls. It also smells absolutely heavenly.
"
"
I have dry, baby-fine hair. Any oil flattens my hair and makes me look like I haven't washed in a month. This product did NOT weigh it down at all and encourages a nice curl. I do use it sparingly--1 pump max--and I'm happy with what it does. It was nice to find something that worked for fine hair. A note about DevaCurl in general. If you don't know what to buy, contact them. Before I purchased, I emailed their customer service and asked for guidance on their products. They answered me promptly and were friendly and helpful. FYI.

This is a really good product but I had to make adjustments. The first time I applied  it I got too much on my hair and it would hardly even dry! And was so greasy that I was embarrassed until I had time to wash it again.But I hated to dismiss a product with great reviews so the next time I mixed a couple of pumps into a spray bottle with maybe four ounces of water and sprayed it all over before air drying and love the results!  So this is my new routine. And the spray will last several shampoos before remixing.

I have used the normal deva styling cream for two years and it worked miracles on my hair. I thought to try this since coconut cream is richer and lasted as a side with dry hair. This stuff did not work for me. It made my hair dull, frizzy by relaxing and separating the curl, and rough feeling. Two weeks back on the normal cream has fixed the problems created from a month on this product.
"
"
I use this cream after using Shea Moisture's Hair Masque. I let my hair dry in a microfiber towel for a while, then take it off and use this cream. I smooth it in then scrunch. I don't think this is the intended use for this particular cream, but it works pretty well for my 2C hair. I took off one star because it does feel a bit sticky and I might switch to a gel in the future. For now, it works as my hair is getting used to being wavy/curly and not brushed out into a frizzy mess.

I have long, 3b, high porosity hair.  I'm caucasian.  This cream is too heavy.  It makes my hair flat and greasy.  I've used it about 6 times now in varying amounts and I get the same result each time.  My hair is dry and usually can take quite a bit of oil or other conditioning products, so this was quite a surprise.
"
"
I actually really like this stuff! I wasn't sure about it when I first bought it - I was going to use it as a replacement for the DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel, but I was worried it would weigh my hair down too much (I've got 2A/3A curls), so I ended up using the gel, and then putting a small amount of this creme in directly afterwards, and I LOVED the effect. I felt like my curls were softer, more defined, and less prone to frizz. Really pleased with this new addition to my hair routine!
"
"
I like it but think I used too much the first time ( watching you tube video's ) it's a heavy cream , good for any hair.... but be careful of the amount  you use if your a beginner, I used 3 pumps on my mixed hair which was too much, I found 1 pump was all I needed.I hope this helps
"
"
I have wavy to curly hair that was just never - right, until I discovered DEVA products.  It doesn't matter if you are really curly or imagine that you are.  And it doesn't take much of any of their products to do the job.  Experiment, and try mixing products - curly girls are always mixing.  Look at the ""how to"" videos and get your own routine going DEVA Curl Super Creme and your curls will ""get right"".
"
"
I have yet to find a DevaCurl product that actually does what it’s described to do. This coconut styler does not hydrate my curls or prevent frizz. In fact, it does the complete opposite. This product left my hair dry, frizzy and my curls are not defined in the least. My hair is a big puffball. I find all their products that I have tried to be very drying. I’m baffled by all the positive reviews. There are much better, less expensive and accessible products available than DevaCurl.
"
"
I only wish I knew about this product years ago! I would saved lots of money on all of these products that simply don't work. But DevaCurl will not disappoint! This is good for thick hair. The cream is rich so a little goes a long way. Your curls will be soft and defined. But don't mess with them after your hair drys! Style your curls while wet and don't touch afterwards. Enjoy the look! You won't want anything else in your hair again!
"
"
From the reviews a lot of people said they can JUST use this product and nothing else and it will keep their curls tame. It did not work like that for me. I need to use this and mousse to keep my hair tame and not frizzy. I first used it all over my head but it makes your hair have this texture to it (kind of greasy) that I didn't like. I started using it just on the bottom half of my hair to keep it a little more tame and give it some moisture and it helps to add some weight to my hair so my curls hang a little bit better. It's okay but I don't think I will buy again after I use it all.
"
"
I have been curly haired my whole life, and back in the 60s and 70s it wasn’t a popular look. I have the kind of curly hair that could never be straightened and have embraced my curly hair throughout the years. Now that I am 52 I have a lot less of it but it is  now curly and straight. A friend recommended deva curl to me, actually, she told me to watch the curly girl on YouTube and that’s where I learned of your products. I’ve loved them ever since
"
"
Love it ! Really does enhances your naturally curly hair ! I use this and dry it with a diffuser and my hair is soft and has a little bit of a coconut scent. I will def buy it again ! I don't understand why these products are so expensive though. I'm not saying through this seller, in general.
"
"
This is a heavier creme based curl product and the results are impressive on my hair in sections.  I can't use it in the top of my hair, because its' thinner on top and the creme would be too heavy.  But I love it in sections of my hair.  I love the smell and smooth texture that I can achieve with this product.  I find that I need different products with my natural hair depending on the cut, thick or thinner hair, and style.  This product lasts a long time and works on 2nd day hair.
"
"
This smelled phenomenal if you love coconuts. I received a small complimentary tube of this from Ulta about a year ago. I have very curly hair and just let it stay curly as its useless even straightening.  This product does the job. I put it on before i use gel and it smooths any frizz i may have.  Its very pricey but it does last a long time.
"
"
I actually have permed hair that only stays curly when it's washed and pretty much opens up towards the end of the day. It also frizzes and looks a bit sad. I have thick hair and I used one pump of this product on freshly washed wet hair. Today's my second day and my hair still looks good. Not curly per say but bouncy and healthy- wavy in places, curly in others. I'm super happy with this product- I can also see it working on thick (not oily) straight hair just as well.
"
"
I would say it helps with curl a little, but unless you have tight, extremely curly hair it doesnt really do that much. Better to go with a texturizer if you have wavy/less curly hair.
"
"
I heard this product was amazing, but it left my hair looking wet... greasy... it was so thick it was hard to spread. It may be great for others but not for me.
"
"
I was looking forward to receiving this product and then I got it and it did not do anything for my hair.  I am Hispanic and my daughter is mixed so I thought, this would be a great product for the both of us; however, I did not notice a difference in either of our hair when we used this product.  Disappointed.
"
"
This probably works great on most people's hair. I've tried everything...I tried to use a little. I tried to use a generous amount.  Combed my hair, didn't comb my hair. No curl, just frizz. Best option for me is any kind of oil and then blow dry out and wear straight. I knew it wasn't good when I tried to wear my hair curly and people don't say a word about my hair.
"
"
I really like this product! Just didn’t give 5 stars because it still struggles to contain all the frizz but, I do realize that’s a big challenge for us curly folks.
"
"
I buy EVERYTHING I can on amazon. This is my FIRST review! I LOVE this stuff. Wow! Granted I just got a haircut but right now I don’t think I will ever blow my hair out again if it looks this good with this product in my hair. I read a lot of reviews before buying this and I feel like it really paid off. Providing pictures would be asking too much of me! No clue what number my curl is. My hair is very thick, wavy, Napa, and an annoyance. I’m so impressed. My hair feels great. The curls are pretty. I can’t say enough!
"
"
I have long, fine, naturally wavy hair.  I haven't worn my hair scrunched in a long time because of the crunchy or greasy feeling most of the products have combined with the terrible friz after my hair dried all the way. My hair doesn't feel like it has product in it, but it's holding my waves and it's not frizzy at all.  I wore my hair wavy last Saturday, then brushed it out and styled it with my curling iron on Sunday (without washing it), and it actually looked great like that too.  I ordered this based on a friend's recommendation and OMG it's fantastic!
"
"
She is just learning to style her hair and this was recommended from her stylist.  She loves it.  Its kind of pricey for me though.  And small.  Will find something else next time but get this as a special time for her.
"
"
This product worked the complete opposite for my naturally curly hair.  It made my hair more frizzy and with no defined curls.  So disappointed after all the hype on this product.  I would like to have returned it but I used it and didn't feel I could return it.  Save your money and don't believe all the hype.
"
"
1 year ago i did the big chop my hair loved it this hair cream. Long time ago i had read about the product and just decided giving a try after seeing it on another curly girl at the office. Delicate smell to coconut non greasy well packaged. Using non sulfate or salt parabens shampoo helps. Not necessarily from their brand
"
"
Unfortunately this product did not work with my hair at all. I tried in 3 times and it left my hair extremely oily. II have had better luck with other curl creams.  Ive tried writing to the company and amazon for a refund and haven't had any luck.
"
"
After being disappointed in the Miss. Jessie product’s overwhelming scent, I ordered this. The smell is amazing! Coconut when it’s wet and barely there when dry. Perfect!My curls are defined, bouncy, and soft. It’s everything I want in a curl cream!
"
"
Ok, so I am a product junkie. I bought this with their shampoo and conditioner kit to try it out.This only smells very slightly as coconut, which was disappointing. This did not hold my curls, even after using so much of it. It did, however, leave my hair very very soft.I would of liked for it to of held better, but it was a let down. I gave it two stars because it really did make my hair soft.
"
"
Not only is this heavy and thick it actually made my hair LESS curly. No amount of scrunching could help it weighed my hair down and made parts look straight and the ends curly. If your looking for a great hair cream go for miss Jessie's pillow soft curls. I've heard so many great things about diva curl but this product is crap and crazy expensive.
"
"
Moisturizes, shapes, and controls frizz. My hair hates most products, this it loves! Highly recommended
"
"
This stuff is amazing! I get a few pumps in my hands, rub them together, and work the magic into my hair. My style can last days instead of hours! Takes out the frizz and holds the curl without any crunchy texture, which is a HUGE win for me. This is a permanent staple in my product supply.
"
"
Smells great, but it didn't do much for my hair, as it left it frizzy on several parts. (I do live in a city where there is high humidity, so it might influence why it didn't work so well)What I do now is split my hair in two sections, 2-3 pumps per section, massage it into my scalp, and then get some mousse to top it off (just a little). I found that works to keep my curls the way I want them to look.
"
"
This is light and fragrant, but not overpowering. When used in conjunction with DevCurl No Poo and One Condition, it gave me happy, frizzless volume with soft, defined curls that stood up to this Georgia humidity! I have very thick, baby fine hair that is curly to wavy.  I love it and will buy it again and again!
"
"
huge scandal and lawsuit. please don’t use DevaCurl products. the victims stories and photos are horrific.
"
"
It smells good and makes my hair look nice. For about 3 hours. My curls are pretty tight on their own and I don’t see a whole lot of change in pattern or tightness. What i don’t like is that this product dries my hair out SO bad. Like, I’ll put in the suggested amount and it looks great, but about three hours in, it starts feeling crunchy, and by the end of the day, my hair is thirsty for a good wash and conditioning. What i want is healthy soft hair, and I thought this would just help keeping it nice and bouncy. So...nice for a short event or whatever, i guess, but not great otherwise, at all.
"
"
Great products.  As with the rest of the devacurl line.
"
"
I love the smell, texture, and slip this product provides.  It does help with curl and style control  I have dry, tight curls/Caucasian hair with quite a bit of gray.  This mixes really well with other products I also like to use in my hair such as leave in conditioner and gel.
"
"
I love this stuff. My HAIR loves this stuff. I love my hair now that I use this stuff. Not a whole lot is needed to get good results (good thing, too, because this stuff is not cheap). Highly recommend... In fact, I recommended it to my mom, so that is a true testament. If you have curls that you are trying to tame into putting their best ""curl"" forward, try this cream.
"
"
I am a devacurl lover but for some reason this product doesn't help with my curls. Shea moisture smoothie does a better job than this. It does however have a pleasant scent. It is a pretty thick product so a little goes a long way.
"
"
I should have listened to the other comments about the smell. I have used other Deva products, and while I prefer that all be unscented, they were tolerable. This one is not, and the smell proceeds you into a room, rendering this product unusable.
"
"
I was so excited to try this product. Not too impressed for the money. I feel like my hair is so tangled the next day. I can barely brush or comb it. I also feel like it is drying my hair out. I believe this is causing my hair to break off. I am not going to finish the bottle, which makes me sad because it was sooooooooooooo expensive.
"
"
I've been natural for over 40 years and have tried tons of similar products and this is one is no different from everything else. Save your money and skip this one. Quantity is small and it costs way too much. This dried out my hair.
"
"
Buyer Beware. Have curly hair and decided to try Devacurl and see what everyone was talking about - NEVER AGAIN. Frizz city! I hate this product and just found out I can't return it. Could this product be counterfeit???
"
"
Shame this cannot be returned, because it will not be used! Smell is hideously artificial. I got a migraine after the first pump came out of the bottle. Why do hair and skin care products insist on using artificial snells?
"
"
I love the smell of this. Very light coconut and definitely that smells fades as hair dries. I have very thick curly hair and put this on the ends of my hair while wet. No clue why the ends, but my deva curl certified stylist told me to do that. My ends always look great with no frizz.
"
"
I love this stuff.  Not much scent, which is a real plus for me.  Holds my hair well when I want to style it without making it crunchy.  You know what I mean.
"
"
I’ve used this product for several years now and it looks and works great for curly hair. I’ve tried it on semi-wavy hair and don’t recommend it.
"
"
Works really well in my thick, curly hair! I'm bi-racial (black and white) so my hair tends to be tightly curled, thick and on the dry side. It's hard for me to find products that are moisturizing and hold the curls without making my hair feel sticky but this is amazing! And it smells really good!
"
"
Love this product however I did NOT purchase this I have before but  not this time idk if this was some type of slip up or way of making money on amazons part but it was too late for me to cancel it and besides I like the product but I’m not happy that this happened this was $18 bucks I didn’t have to spend.
"
"
If you have frizzy curly hair, try this product. I usually add the gel as well and layer these in my hair, but the frizz is gone and the curls are bouncy.
"
"
It’s ok. It works but I like the Styling Cream touchable curl definer better which is also by Deva. This one after applying to my hair makes my hair feel crunchy unlike the styling cream which makes your hair look great without feeling the product on your hair.
"
"
I love all things Deva Curl and this is no exception! Works wonders on my frizz prone hair. Using this product with the towel-turban technique in combination with a diffuser makes my curls less unruly without weighing it down.
"
"
Brought it twice. They arrived in perfect condition in spite of harsh weather. Love Deva curl products & found super cream + gel works best as leave in conditioner for wet hair.
"
"
Since my wife found this foaming hair cream this is all she uses.  She naturally has very curly hair and this product helps her manage it when styling.
"
"
I still need a little bit of curling gel but not much. I add a oil/shine product to it.
"
"
This product used to make my hair very shiny and curly now it makes it look like a big ball of clay.. a big knot
"
"
My son has long, tight, curly, and nappy hair.  This product is heaven on earth!  I use it after his shower at night and he wakes up with soft, bouncy, defined curls.  No more knots or frizz!!  LOVE this stuff!!!!!
"
"
Great styling product, used by my hairstylist so then I bought here! Doesn't make my hair feel gummy, just have to use the right amount. I have thinning old hair and this makes it feel better and keep the style.
"
"
This makes my hair tacky-feeling and greasy. I've tried varying amounts from a pea sized to a quarter sized and it either has no effect or makes my hair greasy.
"
"
I use this product after the leave-in conditioner and before the styling gel. The trio works wonder in reducing frizz and making better defined curls. I've received numerous comments about my hair looking nice after using this routine.
"
"
I love this stuff. I have fine 3a/3b curls and it easily gets weighed down. Using the cream only doesn't give me much hold, but when I mix it with Bounce Curl light-cream gel it works like magic. It's the only thing that gives my curls hold. Although frizziness is still a slight issue but overall it's a very nice product.
"
"
One of my favorite products for fine curly hair. It tames the frizz and just gives me beautiful defined curls with body.
"
"
After using this, I won't use anything else. I have thick curly hair. Every curl is soft, defined, and bouncy. The smell....omg the most intoxicating hair product I've ever smelled. I also use this on my 18 month old who has sensitive skin.
"
"
It's a good moisturizer but concerning definition, it was disappointing. I have 3c/4a hair and felt that it didn't do much for my hair. I feel like this works great for looser and finer hair.
"
"
Loooove this stuff. It smells absolutely amazing and for wavies or girls with finer hair, a little bit goes a loooong way. And I really do mean a LITTLE bit. Don't put a ton of this in your hair or it'll look greasy and weighed down! Just a tiny bit will coat all your hair, get it smelling AMAZING, and make it feel luxurious. It also helps me combat frizz and gives my hair a soft wavy/curly texture.
"
"
This stuff is great! Finally starting taking care of my perpetually dry, frizzy hair by using decent products, and this was the first one I turned to. It's a little expensive, but worth it.Do NOT use if your hair is only ""wavy"" or is thin. This stuff is very heavy.
"
"
My curls look healthier than they ever have. They have definition and I get so many compliments. I have very dry hair so this helps a little with that.
"
"
Giving it 5 stars because my curls have never been this soft. It isn't heavy but the softness is weighing down the curls a little by eliminating all lift at the scalp. I should be able to do as some have advised though and not use it near the scalp and that would make it perfect.
"
"
I hace permed and colored hair.  This is great.  Moisturizing, makes curls look good, and good hold.  I will buy this again.  It smells good too.
"
"
Touchable soft curls!!! Little to no frizz on hundred + degree days or humid days. I don’t know where this is been all my life but it’s the only product line I now use on my hair.
"
"
I read so many great reviews about this product and it did not work as expected.  I have naturally curly/kinky hair and I thought this would help defrizz the curls and make them more ""lush"" however it just weighed my hair down.  I wouldn't use this product again
"
"
Love this product. I have tried a million different stylers for my curly hair. It keeps my hair from frizzing. I can just put it on my wet hair, scratch it and it leaves nice soft curls.
"
"
I didn’t like it. I didn’t like the way it made my hair feel.  I would give it a C C C C C C C C C C
"
"
Leaves my hair super greasy the next day, but it curls my hair so I’m happy with that.
"
"
I don’t really like the stuff. Like putting coconut wax on your hair.
"
"
Finally curls with no crunch. I do still need mousse and on really high humidity days a bit of jelly too.
"
"
I tried a little and I tried a lot. Both ways it took the curl out of my fine, curly hair. Would probably be better for thicker hair?
"
"
Smells wonderful! Great product! Devacurl products have helped my hair over the past few months. My hair is looking much healthier than before I used DevaCurl.
"
"
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT LEAVES MY CURLS DEFINED AND FRIZZ FREE. I couldn't love it more! I pair it with DevaCurl Decadence no poo and leave in conditioner right after I shower. I also use DevaCurl gel after applying this product. It is the only product that I can get multi day curls.
"
"
This is great for my hair and is approved by the curly girl method! Has a great hold and isn’t sticky.
"
"
One of the best products I have tried from this company. I live on the coast and it really helps me control my curly hair
"
"
This curl cream is AMAZING!!!  I use it on my thick, tends to frizz hair and on my 4 year olds' fine beautiful curls and it works great for both of us. Also, you only need a little bit, so it will last forever. I would have never tried it if I hadn't gotten a sample with an order from another company.
"
"
This product made my hairline breakout in an immediate rash.
"
"
Nice
"
"
So glad I found this! Love the  light coconut smell! It defines my curls & takes away the frizz!
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and have always been on a search for the perfect product that does not make my hair crunchy or sticky. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. It creates perfect shiny curls that last for days. I have found the perfect product for my curls, my search is finally over.
"
"
My fav curl crepe. Even though I am losing some of my curl.
"
"
love this product..I have irish curls...n this keeps them soft..frizz free..and looking good
"
"
It's Amazing. I used with light hold Deva curls gel and I just love it. My curls are in the best shape.
"
"
My curly hair lovessss this supercream! It’s so moisturizing and makes my curl light and bouncy. Adding the b’leavin stuff helps leave my curls defined and controls my frizz.
"
"
But I have to apply in the next day, to have the same results. Makes my hair dry :(
"
"
I’ve been using this product for years on my curly hair, our use it along with the gel and it keeps my hair nice and curly without for frizz.
"
"
Although my hair does not love coconut, this cream is truly great. I think you can’t really go wrong with the Deva Curl heavy hitters. - the supercream, the gel, the deep conditioning are all wondeful. I have type 3a/3b curls. Make sure that you are properly deep contioning/hair mask your hair once a week to help your curls get into their pattern and stay healthy. Remember that not one cream can do it all, having curly hair is a process and it takes dedication. Having said that, this is great for a wash and go, along with Deva gel.
"
"
This stuff was a total letdown.  I expected more than useless, sticky creme from Deva.  This goo made my hair even more frizzy than if I let it go without product whether I applied it to damp, dripping, or dry hair.  Not worth the money.
"
"
Product came with broken top and half product emptied into bag. Not returnable for some reason. Disappointed.
"
"
This product works very well, although my hair looks wet for much longer than it usually does after applying (without blow drying).
"
"
Amazing for soft and frizz free curls.  I used it today with the Heaven conditioner and the results at amazing.
"
"
I love the NON-coconut styling cream. I don’t like the smell of this one and it makes my hair “heavy”.
"
"
Love this stuff, works great with my thick and curly hair! Good price too.
"
"
I like this product a lot. It holds my hair in place without being stiff. It eliminates frizz. It also smells really good!
"
"
I have 3A/3B, very thick, somewhat dry, high porosity hair that goes about halfway down my back. I shampoo my hair maybe once or twice a month, and I usually use either DevaCurl One Condition or SheaMoisture Conditioner (the one with manuka honey - I can't remember the exact name), and comb a pump or two of conditioner through my hair after I'm done showering as leave-in. Once I've applied whatever styling product I use, I plop for 10-30 minutes, depending on how late I'm running for work :) For the last 10 years or so, the styling product that I keep returning to is TIGI Catwalk Curl Amplifier, which I water down and then finger-comb through my hair. I figure some background information is helpful, because if your hair is at all different than mine, this review probably won't apply to you! ;)The first few times I used this product, I wasn't a convert. I combed it through after showering/using leave-in, plopped, and went about my normal routine. I noticed my hair dried much faster than it does with the Curl Amplifier (especially the ends), and it gave me much better definition and control than the first cream that Deva released (although I absolutely love the smell of the other cream! This one just smells coconutty). My curls were less crunchy and more voluminous than with the Amplifier, and the SuperCream didn't create a ""cast"" that I had to break. I found that it looked the best if, once my hair was fully dry, I flipped my hair down, shook it out a little, and then changed my part to the other side. My hair was very soft, and a little wilder than what I'm used to, but in a sexy windblown way, not a rat's nest-lion's mane way. I noticed that it paired better with the SheaMoisture conditioner than the One Condition, for both curl definition and smell. The biggest obstacle that kept me from loving it was how much I had to use. Like I said above, I have long, thick hair, and I had to use at least three pumps to get good results. There wasn't enough definition/control to get good second-day hair, so I was pretty much just showering every day. At that rate, I was almost out in less than a month. Once again, I returned to the Amplifier, because even though I liked my soft and sexy curls, the Amplifier costs half as much and lasts twice as long.However, I still keep the SuperCream in my product arsenal (and give it 5 stars!) because I realized it's my Hair Holy Grail for second-day hair. I'll use the Amplifier on Day 1, pineapple my hair before I go to bed, and then when I wake up I flip over, take out my hair tie, and scrunch about half of a pump of SuperCream through my curls. Then I lightly spray it with Deva's shine spray. My curls look better on Day 2 than Day 1 now, and the bottle I bought 3 months ago is still half-full!I feel like this review turned into a summary of how high-maintanance my hair is, so if you actually read the entire thing, thank you ;) In summation, if you're considering this product, go ahead and buy it - if you don't like it immediately, try to use it a different way. If you still don't like it, send it to me! (or another curly-haired friend)
"
"
Works well on my 4b/4c hair. Don't know why I waited so long to try this. It will be a staple in my hair routine.
"
"
I really do not have curly hair but I color my hair and I have found this is great it helps with the frizzy look you can get because the ends dry out.
"
"
Love love love this product my hair is super curly and this just mAkes it better
"
"
Good for curls
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Used Axeda for yrs. and it’s much better than this overpriced junk.
"
"
I have fairly curly, thick, 2 B hair.  Unfortunately this just didn't work for me.  It weighed my hair down, leaving it looking limp.  Even with a gel on top, it still didn't hold for more than a few hours.
"
"
Amazing product. One of my favorite products
"
"
I don’t really care for these products.  They don’t work as advertised.
"
"
My frizzy hair became more frizzy and dry after using these Deva Curl products. I bought the gel, foam, and cream. Used them separately, combined,  and every which way I could. Air dryers, diffused ... nothing worked and my hair looked like a birds nest! Stay away!
"
"
My hair is very long with soft curls. This product is the only one that works defining my curls and helping me with the frizz. I gave it 4 stars because I need another bottle every 2 to 2.5 months.
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
Under testing
"
"
Deva girl
"
"
It’s the real shiz! I love it.
"
"
somehow I did not like this the first time I used, no moisture and lots of frizz on my  3a/b low porosity coarse hair. Insisted with it and decide to use it on top of the ""as i am leave-in moisturiser"" and it worked perfectly. curls were nice and defined and most importantly look really natural. pity that is so expensive so again trying new stuff but will probably re-purchased at one point.

Makes hair soft but doesn’t seem to have a lasting moisturizing effect.
"

Since embracing my curls a few months ago I've been searching for a holy grail product - for me, this is it! My curls look the best they have outside of getting them dried at the salon, and my second day curls aren't half bad, either! Overall, so happy I bought this.
"
"
Great for long curly spirals. I will buy this again.
"
"
Love this stuff! I mix it with the Devacurl mirrorshine. Ultimate hydration and shine. A necessary product for any naturalista
"
"
Delivered broken. No pump or way to get it out. Had to break off the top, and there's no working lid, very frustrating.
"
"
This styling cream works really well. It keeps my hair really light and curls defined. The scent took some time to get used to though. It really does have a strong coconut scent and at first I was smelling it all day. I got used to it after a few days but next I'm just going to get the unscented option.
"
"
Great for naturalista's.
"
"
It works really well no cons to it it really helps make my natural wave hair curlier
"
"
This is fabulous for anyone with curly hair ! I haven't had split ends in forever and my hair hasn't been frizzy since I started using this product!
"
"
The SuperCream is one of my favorite curly stylers for my thick high-porosity hair. It's very hydrating and gives a lot of body and definition to my hair. Authentic deva curl product!
"
"
Love this product for my thick curly hair!
"
"
This product works great to help create curls throughout my hair. I mix it with B'Leave In and scrunch it throughout my hair before I get out of the shower.  A little ""cocktail"" recipe from my hairdresser!
"
"
Use it on my hair
"
"
SuperCream smells great, not too heavy or oily. Very moisturizing with very little weight.  Allows me to scrunch throughout the day without feeling like I’m breaking or damaging my hair.
"
"
It made my hair oily and didn’t last but less then an hour. I followed directions as the bottle said.  Be careful because you can’t return it now.
"
"
Works for my curls
"
"
It gives a lot of shape and texture to my curls!! It makes my medium thick hair looks healthy and beautiful!
"
"
This did nothing for my hair and caused my face to erupt in zits. Do not recommend.
"
"
Awesome product!  Great price!!CVS charges 28.00 for this.
"
"
This product works fast in decreasing the dark spots on my hands and face
"
"
It makes my hair curl. It cuts down on any frizzy loose ends. Love this! Will buy again.
"
"
Good for curls
"
"
Makes my hair smell amazing, way less frizz now!
"
"
First of all it arrived bursted open in the box so that wasnt very pleasant. Also this was very drying.
"
"
Love the softness of my curls. Its not like some mousse where your hair is stiff. And it smells awesome!
"
"
I’ll give this 5 stars because it’s very silkening.  It has no hold whatsoever, but really helps moisturize my hair.
"
"
Love this product.  Makes my hair soft, yet manageable.
"
"
I like this product, smooths and moisturizes curls.
"
"
It works and smells so good
"
"
waste of money. Does not help my hair at all. just weighs it down and makes it more greasy.
"
"
perfect soft hold of my curls, not crunchy at all
"
"
Good product for the price
"
"
Locked my curls right away and no frizz
"
"
My curls feel soft and nourished. It's not a great defrizzer but definitely a good something between mousse and a leave-in.
"
"
Works great for my curly hair- really makes the curls spiral beautifully.
"
"
Ordered 5 Set, put them in bath and she was jumping up and down. She was so happy. Well, Thanks to DivaCurl our vacation became magical in Vegas. Definitely recommend this for 😎.
"
"
Loving this cream.  Great balance
"
"
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! My favorite cream from DevaCurl!  It could get heavy for fine hair.  Works best if applied on SOAKING wet hair.
"
"
Meh. I have wavy frizzy hair. This product didn’t do a thing for my frizz. It was soft though.
"
"
Love it

--If you found this review helpful, please click ""helpful""--I love ALL Deva Curl products! The more products I get - the more I love the brand! They leave my curls hydrated, bouncy, and shiny! On non wash days, I just spray my hair a little and put a tiny amount of this in my hair to refresh and BAM! My hair looks fabulous...again!-UPDATE:-This product makes my curls so bouncy and full of volume. The top generally falls flat but I use this and clip it up (see YouTube tutorial by Deva Curl) and BAM! So much volume!Curly and wavy girls, you need this! This will transform your hair!Thanks to @HiF3licia, I now realize that my curls need lots and lots and lots of moisture, love, and attention. Deva Curl products are all silicone, paraben, and sulfate free; all of those chemicals are awful for curly hair. Since purchasing this item in February (it's not July), my hair has started to transform from frizzy waves to more defined spirals. It's not all the way where I want it YET, but I am sure that with the curly girl method, it will be soon! The pictures attached are in chronological order. With consistent use of DC products, I am starting to see my curls become so beautiful!I do recommend learning how to ""wet plop"" because I find that it helps my hair so much PLUS it gets it out of the way when I'm getting ready. Also, deep condition whenever you shower with shampoo. It sounds like a lot but I just deep condition as I'm washing my body and shaving. The bowl method works wonders, too. I get made fun of by my boyfriend but he loves the results. The bowl method coats each strand of hair equally with product. I found out that most times if a curl is going haywire, it means it didn't get properly coated with product. The bowl method eliminates that and I do notice a big difference.Oh, and a silk pillowcase is your friend, girls! Not only for hair but also for your skin!--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--

DO NOT BUY. Knock off version of the real devacurl product. Not the real DevaCurl Styling Cream!!!!!

I have 3A/3B curls and have been styling my hair relatively the same way since the 7th grade (I'm now 29!  #curlyhairproblems).  I've tried just about every drugstore product and a handful of salon products to help manage my curls and have been using DevaCurl for the past 4 months.  I think I've found the perfect combination for my hair and it involves this product.  By itself, I do not like the cream on my hair-- it feels like my hair is too poofy and needs something stronger to set it.  When I mixed this product with equal parts Ultra Defining Gel (which makes my hair too stiff), a miracle happened!  Both products together work well in keeping my curls defined, yet bouncy.  I've tried this combination twice and it's worked great each time, so I'm sold (because, before now, I've NEVER been able to reproduce good hair days two washes in a row...just doesn't happen!).  Also, I was able to wear my hair down for multiple days between washings.  In the attached photos, I just got in from a wind storm, which shows that the cream/gel combo can allow your hair to take a beating).  Crossing my fingers I didn't jinx my hair luck by writing this review.  As far as the smell goes, it smells like Skittles and is a little too strong for my preference.  Still ok, though!
"
"
I've been using DevaCurl products for years. I've always used the exact same drying process, styling routine, and care. I've used a mixture of different brands that worked extremely well with devacurl. My routine was borderline flawless at this point. I saw that amazon had the styling cream cheaper so I bought it. I've been using it for a month and it did not give me the same results. My hair dried out completely from using this product. My curls are stringy and lifeless. I thought since the weather is getting colder I'd need more moisture, so I switched back to just pure devacurl products to see if it would improve. nothing. same end result, stringy, dry curls.I'm not sure if I just got a bad one, but honestly I can't even use it anymore.
"
"
I am obsessed with this stuff. This has become my holy grail hair styling product. I use this together with Renpure coconut whipped creme and let my hair air dry, then fluff with a tiny bit of thin hair oil and it leaves my hair so soft, bouncy, and defined!!! Smells amazing too, like skittles :)
"
"
I heard that the gel is the magic and the curling cream that is meant to be paired with it is pointless without the gel. I have type 3b hair and honestly it isn't as great as it is glorified to be. What I do like is the soft to touch, no hardness the gel leaves me with when my hair dries and i lovee the fullness it gives me when it drys (pillow soft for sure!) --but I do not like that it does not hold enough for 2nd day hair.I have to rewet my hair again and apply product to get my hair to look nice the 2nd day. It is too expensive to apply everyday. You will also have to apply a lot of oils since it does leave your hair looking dull and not shiny. Although it is soft... what can I say, we are all still searching for THE perfect product...
"
"
I'm really digging this cream! My hair is a combo of course and fine wavy hair. Usually the products i try are either too stiff or my hair is all frizz. This is a nice light, non sticky product that leaves my hair bouncy but not fizzy. I highly recommend!
"
"
I had used this off and on for a few years as a backup to the Deva Curl Ultra-Defining Gel, but never really liked it because I wasn't crazy about the smell.  I used the Ultra-Defining Gel most regularly, even though I never felt like I could work it through my hair enough and it left my hair feeling really crunchy.  I then switched to Ouidad Tress Effects Styling Gel, which had, for the most part, rave reviews.  It had a nice feel to it, but as much as I tried to use the ""rake and shake"" method for getting my curls to be defined and beautiful, it left me with straight chunks, weirdly-formed curls, and it was made even worse if I had to put a hat on over wet hair.As a last resort one day, with very wet hair, I put a half pump of the DevaCurl Styling Cream in my palm and worked it evenly through my hair.  I took a large and wide-toothed comb through my hair a couple of times, and then used a microfiber towel to soak up the excess water.  When my hair dried, I had perfectly-formed shiny and beautiful curls-  with very little effort and no ""method""!  It wasn't crunchy, it wasn't greasy-feeling, there were no weird straight chunks.  All over my head were beautiful curls.I still cannot stand the smell of this product.  Someone said it has a ""cloying smell"", and I have to agree.  Luckily, after my hair dries, the smell subsides.  And I have been using this product every day for over a month, and there has not been a day where I have not had beautiful curls on my head, even with wearing a winter hat _and_ a bike helmet! And again, with no crunch and very little effort.

This product is fantastic for managing curly hair without looking greasy or oily. I've been using it for 2 years, and it keeps my curls in great shape, non-frizzy, with natural movement and body. I use it both on wet hair after a shower, and a tiny bit on dry hair to retain shape after waking up. I have natural corkscrew curls with coarse, dense hair and had completely given up on wearing my hair curly. After getting pointed toward this product, I have been wearing my hair curly happily to terrific compliments from friends and co-workers. The product has a light, pleasant lemongrass scent. I have fairly short hair, and one container lasts me about 3 months so there's plenty of value for me in the price.

I have ethnic 4 something type of hair. And it is super hard trying to find products that will work and fulfill all of its promises listed on the bottle. I usually stir away from buying any products and use organic oils instead. However, I wanted something for my wash-and-go and for in-between styles. So when I went to the salon, the stylist told me this is what she personally uses (especially for the days she wants her hair curly). So I tried it.It is NOT like a gel it is truly a cream product. It dries with a light film (hard to described) that leaves your hair slightly hardened but not in a crunch way. It will NOT give you a lot of hold at all (which is a good thing for me). It's almost the feeling on a luxe soft paste if I'm making ANY SENSE LOL. It will certainly give you a bit more curl definition, however, it will NOT keep your curls that way once you tease/comb it out (which is typical for a cream product). It's the best option, I've found so far, to lock in and KEEP moisture in your hair after washing your hair or in between washes (using a spray bottle as this needs to be applied to semi-wet hair). It is not greasy or heavy, so this is good for all seasons.I know the price is steep ($24 at Sephora), but it's a good product.... even though we would all love for it to be cheaper right?! LOL. But you really get a quality product that matches that price point, unlike some other brands. You also do NOT have to use a lot. I have a lot of hair and I use about 2-5 pumps (which is not a full pump like other products, its comparable to like a skincare pump) depending on if I've washed my hair or not. I would use less in between wash days and the most when my hair is drenched. This product is to be used on wet hair, so use a spray bottle to moisten your hair then apply. This will also help you use less product of course. This is for retaining your natural curls and I have not used this on straightened hair. I really like this product and this is my first time buying from this brand, so I was impressed. I would recommend, hope this helps :)

I bought deva curl and after my first use, my hair looked atrocious— not at all what I was expecting. After doing some research, I’ve learned that devacurl products have been causing hair loss and scalp irritation for thousands of women. There’s even an on-going lawsuit against Devacurl for those exact reasons. If you go to the Think Dirty app and type in devacurl, you will see how poorly made and how bad their products are for your hair. Although I haven’t experienced this because I have only used it twice, there are plenty of videos on YouTube and groups on Facebook that have people attesting to this. All I can tell you is to do your research.
"
"
Was hoping for a light weight product to use instead of gel. It is light weight at first but the after effects are unfortunate as it causes your hair to be really greasy. I can get away with not washing my hair every day even when having product in it but can’t do that when I have this product in my hair as I have to wash it the next day just to get all of the grease out from this. Sadly this was a waste of money as after a couple tries I won’t be using what is left in my bottle.
"
"
LOVE. Can’t say enough good things about this product. If the Deva Curl Wave Maker isn’t enough and the Deva Curl Super Cream is too heavy for you THIS is your happy medium. I was in the same position and tried this and I get compliments daily on my curls after I started using this in my routine. I use other products but if you had to this does most of the job on its own for styling. Apply to your hair as soon as you shut the water off for your wash day on sopping wet hair for best results!
"
"
Love love love my DevaCurl styling cream!  I put a little on my wet hair and then pull it up into a sumo ponytail before I go to bed and wake up with the most beautiful curls. With one quick run of my fingers through my hair separating the curls and I’m ready for a full day of gorgeous, curly hair.  It doesn’t get frizzy, or look crunchy, it looks like a spent hours with the iron or spent the night trying to sleep with curlers in my hair.
"
"
I was so dissapointed with this product! It made my curly hair look worse. I have naturally spiral curls that get very frizzy. It seemed to make it look more frizzy and did not hold my hair at ALL. The only thing I liked about this product is it smells great. My neice said it smells like chewed up Skittles! So, I gave it to her.
"
"
This is a great product which I use to control my curls. Scent is not bad, and bottle can last for a month plus, as you need to use just a little. But... I’ll never buy this product on Amazon again, because last time I got a fake product. Scent is different, hair looks different. Basically it’s like the cream doesn’t work any. Buying is from Walmart now, more expensive but the real thing. And still cheap than the hair salon prices.
"
"
Curly haired girls NEED this. Tamps down the frizz and revitalizes curls no matter when you use it. I refresh my look in the evening with a bit of this after dampening my hands and it works! Love the smell...not overpowering but clean smelling. I use this in conjunction with Delacurl ultra defining  gel.
"
"
I LOVE DevaCurl Styling Cream.  What I got was NOT DevaCurl.  I ordered mine from the company Gold Fulfillment.  I ordered 3 bottles.  The 1st one was the real product.  It performed just like the one I bought at a salon.  However, the other 2 contain something other than DevaCurl Styling Cream.  It dries my hair out and it's just a frizzy mess.  To test, I bought another one from the salon and used it after...definitely not my hair or imagination.  So be careful buying this.  For the price, I was SO EXCITED to buy off Amazon instead of the salon.  I am disappointed I will have to buy at the salon to be sure I'm getting the real deal.
"
"
I really wanted to love devacurl products. I had an issue with the styling cream. I didnt think much of it until i would get large tangles at the nape of my neck and i have NEVER had that issues with any of the other products i used. Also started noticing my curls were getting less defined, since i discontinued use they are starting to make a recovery. I know it was this product because since i have stopped using it everything else is the same except the styling cream and everything is getting better with my hair.
"
"
This, coupled with the B'Leave-In curl Boost and Volumizer, has changed my world. Seriously. I had no idea that a product could fix so much about my hair. Additionally, I've lost a lot less hair on the daily since I have switched entirely to Deva Curl products, and overall my hair looks and feels so much healthier. Absolutely fantastic product.
"
"
I love deva curl products but you should ALWAYS make sure you're buying from a legit source. There are expired or altogether fake products out there and it would be really unfortuante to spend money on old or fake hair products. This stuff is a godsend for curlies with fine hair and delicate curls though. It's my go-to!
"
"
I have used this item previously through ULTA and was thoroughly pleased with the product. This item I purchased through Amazon is terrible! Smells awful and reacts to curly hair completely different from the original product. Made my hair brittle instead of soft controlled curls.
"
"
Wow! I don't even know where to begin. I only purchased this item as my first deva curl product and I am amazed as to how great it makes my curls feel. It leaves them soft and frizz free. My hair looks healthy and shiny. Smells like citrus. Get compliments from everyone!!! Highly recommend. The price is very worth it. A little goals a long way.
"
"
I gave this a 4 star because, while it didn't work for me, a friend of mine liked it.  When i used this product I felt my eyes were irritated. It did not have the same affect on her.  I also felt it was a little to heavy for my hair.  If it had not irritated my eyes, I would have tried using less product an diluting with a little water.
"
"
I love the scent.  It certainly does smell like candy.  I would recommending using this with another product.  I don't know what.  I have used a little mouse.  I was trying to get away from the hard crunchy look.  But this really doesn't do much other than hold curl.  I was expecting something a little more than a lotion type hair product.
"
"
This product is so much better than the mousse I was using before. I like the pump bottle better than the spray from an ecologist standpoint. I like that my hair looks fuller and feels softer when I use it ! I wish that it did not contain alcohol and a group of chemicals like disodium edta and aminomethyl propanol , cetrimonium chloride. Why can’t “natural” products use natural preservatives and emulsifiers ?! Deva Shan , lead the way, please! You are the curly hair standard 😍
"
"
I use this with the DevaCurl ultra defining gel. I don’t know if it is them both together that makes it great or one or the other, but I love them. I got this and a satin pillow case and it has done wonders for my hair. I no longer have to wash it everyday to make it look decent. I say that because I don’t think I will ever love my thin hair! I took pictures of day one through three to show how well it held up.
"
"
I may be the only curly haired person that this didn't work for. This did not have enough control and my hair was very frizzy. It did make my hair soft though. Other users kept telling me I needed to use more but at that point it was getting greasy and at that price I would have used it to fast to make it cost effective. The gel worked better for me.
"
"
This hair product is awesome!  I have wavy dry hair that tends to frizz even if humidity is just talked about.  Just a tiny bit of this product rubbed into my damp or wet hair turns the frizz to fab!  After a couple of days use, I then rinse with warm water and apple vinegar (never shampoo!) and start the process all over.  Full head of beautiful , natural , waves and curls.  So many compliments too!  Love it, love it, love it!

I was so excited after reading all of the great reviews and thought this would be the answer to my thick, wavy, often frizzy hair.  After commenting on a strangers fantastic haircut while out shopping and her recommendation of Deva Curl I splurged and ordered the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream.  Sadly it is not the right product for me.  My hair looked dirty at the crown and did not smell fresh.  It's possible that I was not using the right quantities, but could not wait it out.  Returned
"
"
I love this cream. It smells like a day at the beach. It easy to use and doesn’t leave my hair crunchy or look like it has a lot of product in it. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting manageable curls of any kind.
"
"
I do like this cream very much though I do mix it with a little of the ultra defining gel. By itself it does leave my hair soft and shiny but I get flyaways sooner. Adding a little gel to it makes my hair stay the way I like it longer. The gel by itself is to stiff so for me I get good results combining the two products.
"
"
This line of products was recommended by my salon (whose opinion I hold in high regard). Tried it. Loved it. It's a little pricey, but what I like is how soft and relatively defined my curls are. Of note: My hair is tight, coarse, kinky, nappy -- whatever you want to call it -- and this stuff helps to make it softer, moister, and more manageable. I use the No-Poo shampoo, the conditioner, mousse, and this styling cream for best results. Oh, it also doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy, it absorbs into the hair very well,
"
"
DevaCurl products have always worked well for my 3b/3c hair.  I use the original formula no poo and one conditioner, the styling cream and the light defining gel. They are staples in my hair care routine and I was seem to come back to them again and again. Pricey, yes.  Worth it if it works, yes.
"
"
Maybe it’s just me but I did not like this product. I used as directed on my naturally curly hair and it left my hair looking greasy, flat and unbrushed. My hair looks better using no product at all vs using this product. I tried using it multiple times.. sometimes with a defuser, sometimes letting it dry naturally... it’s a F in my book, hopefully it works better for you!
"
"
This stuff is awful. Made me wavy hair straight. Amazon didn't want to allow me to return it until I spoke with them. Avoid it!
"
"
Before you purchase this product look into the current class action lawsuit against Deva Curl regarding ALL of their products. Save yourself the  heartache, hair loss and damage. Take 5 min to look on YouTube to see what is happening to other users.
"
"
Recently given a sample, next day bought these. I think my only small complaint is the amount for the price, but overall I would buy again. I really like the way my hair feels, soft but with shine and flexible hold.
"
"
Good product not as powerful as supercream but still good
"
"
As they tell you a little goes a long way.  I have what I would consider short to medium length hair and two pumps is plenty even though you feel like you should use more.  It does a wonderful job on my curls along with the ultra defining gel.
"
"
I have used other DevaCurl products but this is my go-to. My hair doesn't feel crunchy and retains the curl and it looks like the curl of my teenage years (i'm 50 now). Not crazy about the no-poo shampoo or conditioner - for my money Redken's Curvaceous Shampoo and conditioner are way better. Plus I have learned us girl haired girls should not be washing every day. I am now only washing 1x per week, but I condition every day. I used to use a lot of products but now it's just the Redken Conditioner and this DevaCurl cream.
"
"
My favorite Deva Curl product by far. It acts like a leave-in conditioner. I apply three pumps of this to my hair while it's still soaking wet in the shower. I then apply a teaspoon or so of Arc Angel. I plop my hair in a microfiber towel until it's mostly dry, then finish drying with a diffuser attachment. I have wavy/curly hair and this keeps it looking soft and healthy.
"
"
helps fight frizz and encourages soft curls without the crunchiness that you get from gel. I wish it was a little cheaper, but it's the only thing I put in my hair now.  It's light and it doesn't smell.
"
"
This did nothing for my hair or my curls . I am very disappointed.
"
"
Amazing curl definition! I noticed some reviewers did not like the smell, but I thought it had a refreshing fruit fragrance. Will definitely be buying again!
"
"
I have been using this for several years and love it. It works as a moisturizer, as well as a styling cream. It does have a mild sweet smell, like Skittles, which is noticeable when wet, but dissipates when dry. On humid or rainy days, I need to use more of it to avoid frizz. The key is not to touch your hair until it is completely dry, and never use a blow dryer.
"
"
Honestly, no other product has worked effortlessly to define my curls. I tried this product because I had some frizz on the top of my curls and it literally defined them more. I have thicker hair and this product provides great moisture. I highly recommended it. It’s pricey but def. worth the money.
"
"
I have type 3B Curly hair. I have straightened and used a curling iron’s for years because I could not control the fridge is or the definition of my curls. I’ve used every drug store product for curly hair and nothing seemed to work. I just use this product for the first time this morning, and the outcome is unbelievable. My hair is soft to the touch, super curly, and for frizz free.
"
"
I feel like I got it for cheaper here than the stores and it works like a charm. Doesn't make your hair hard and it smells great.
"
"
Didn't work well on my hair at all! I tried using small amounts worked up to larger amounts Used a total of 3 times since buying. My curls looked frizzy and  we're sticky and stiff. Definitely not touchable curls.
"
"
I ordered this wanting the original formula style cream from devacurl, I received the Coconut super cream instead. I am not a fan of the coconut supercream at all. It smells strongly like artificial coconut (suntan lotion) and I don't find it to have as good hold as the original.
"
"
Works great on my natural curls and smells great! Doesn't weigh down the hair and I saw a pretty quick reaction to the spring in my curls after running it through my hair. If your hair starts to dry before getting it all over, wet your hands and run it through the dry areas.
"
"
Disappointed just wasted $20 on this is awful stuff. I wash and condition my hair and lightly towel dry ..never blow dry or use a brush so this stuff went in my wet curls and I let my hair air dry as usual  Left my hair looking very dull and dry with a sticky feel as well a heavy.I'm  going back to Ouidad humidity gel
"
"
If you have waves or fine hair, it’s still a great product, just use sparingly and/or mix in palm with some water :)
"
"
Good moisturizing cream. Provides some hold. Less rigid than Deva's An-gel or Ultra Defining Gel (or whatever the heck they're calling it these days). Plus, nice coconut scent.
"
"
Am so so upset! This product had NO TOP and this is what I found when opened box. No return policy. This is BS. have no way to report this. I want a replacement
"
"
This hair cream has a light coconut/floral scent that I'm obsessed with. It's a clean and refreshing scent that stays in my hair all day! I love it! I have naturally wavy hair, but using this product tends to bring out the spiral curls! You only need a quarter-sized pump of this and you should spread it through your hair evenly to prevent any waxy feeling. I highly recommend this product for people wanting to create lush, bouncy, natural curls. Use with a diffuser for optimal results.
"
"
I can’t go with out this product now!I love that it does not weigh down my thin/ fine hair! I use it on wet hair, whether I leave my hair curly or I straighten it. I even use a little on 2-3day dry hair to get rid of any frizz.Also, this product was a life saver on my vacation in the Florida humidity!
"
"
I first tried this on a very small section of my hair while dry. It actually make it feel soft and smooth once it re-dried. I used it again on my whole head while my hair was damp. Again make my hair feel smooth and moisturized. I really like this so far, and most likely will buy this again and again. No crunch, no build up. Smells like skittles :). Stuff is pricey (normal price) but I cannot deny that it works.
"
"
My daughter started me on Deva products.  Pretty great so far.  I love this cream.  It builds volume and handles curl.  No smell.  No dirty build up.
"
"
Not my favorite Deva Curl product. A little too heavy for my fine, curly hair. I might try it again, but first impressions aren’t great.
"
"
Deva curlstyling cream works great to bring life into my toddlers curls are she has slept on them. I also use it on my hair to tame the frizz. Smells great!
"
"
Written by Joseph's fiancéReally nice product but very easy to use too much and then my hair is greasy for the day.  I like to use it as a frizz tamer after I use other products.  Just a tiny bit in my hands and smooth down any random curls
"
"
I have fine, silky naturally curly hair that tends to get weighed down with product.  I absolutely love this product!  It is light and does not weigh down my curls.  I apply a little to damp hair and squeeze it in.  It holds my well defined curls for days.
"
"
Overall great product. I have to keep reminding myself to use less than I think I need. Using too much will make my (3A curly) hair sticky and frizzy. The less I use, the better. Works best on wet (not dripping) hair when mixed with a little water first. Reactivates well for no-shower days. Might require a little product to touch up stubborn frizzy spots though.
"
"
This is a great product and I love it. The other one with coconut my hair didn't like so I was reluctant to try this one, but I am glad that I did it is amazing.
"
"
This product is A-mazing. It smells great, it has a nice texture & consistency, it feel fantastic when you put it on your hair. I have long curly hair & I love this product. I have tried & purchased tons of hair products for years & this is the best one so far. I totally recommend it for anyone with curly or wavy hair.
"
"
This package came completely broken. I was really excited and made the investment to buy styling cream (broke college student woes) and it came completely broken off the top in an ENVELOPE and now the cream is everywhere in the bag and the smell is too much.
"
"
This product is so heavy. I used this product while my hair was soaking wet and only used two pumps. This product left my hair so weighed down that my Shirley temple curls looked like an embarrassing rats nest that barely survived a hurricane. I don't recommend this product to anyone.
"
"
I like this cream, but it didn't seem as if it added any moisture to my daughter's hair. That's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. I know it is a styling cream and for that it did hold her style.
"
"
Really like this product as well... I use it with the B’lieve miracle product after I was my hair.  They do a great job “setting” my curls!
"
"
This works okay, it doesn't control my frizz as much as I would like it to. I accidentally bought it when I was trying to buy the supercream. It smells like the GooGoo car wash air freshness- I don't hate it.
"
"
My hair, using this in combination with the gel from DevaCurl, finally looks amazing. I've used everything under the sun to try and sculpt my curls and keep the frizz to a minimum; I finally found something that works in humidity. My hair loss touchably soft and smells great. I would definitely recommend any product in the DevaCurl line ♡
"
"
What people are saying about this product causing health issues and hair loss is all true!! I always thought it was me, but after I stopped using it, no more headaches and itchiness. Don’t use this product!
"
"
My hair is kind of a hot mess of curls, this helps it not look like pubes.
"
"
Yes I do love this product it gives you soft and friz free curls .
"
"
My daughter has curly ringlet hair and this works great
"
"
This is a mist for my very wavy hair. I use this with the arc angel gel. Perfect waves for days.
"
"
It’s ok. The price is cheaper on Amazon than you’ll find it for elsewhere
"
"
This is the best. It adds enough stiffness to hold hair in place. Plus it adds shine. The coconut scent is wonderful too
"
"
Great product I actually have straight hair but use this and scrunch my hair and it makes it wavy!
"
"
Mi cabello se puso reseco
"
"
Smells subtly like skittles. My partner loves the smell. This has completely changed my curls combined with a co-washing method. Try it, you won’t regret it!
"
"
I love Deva Curl.  This styling cream is thick and coats my curls.  When I scrunch my hair it stays curly and reduces the frizz.  I also use the Lo Poo and Conditioner and Set it Free.  All the Deva Curl products are worth the money.  I'm not sure if what I got is counterfeit or real but it works anyway!Would recommend it to anyone with curly/wavy hair.
"
"
So far, I'm very pleased with this product. I have 3b curls that tend to get stringy and separate since I've straightened my hair most of the time for the past 13 years, but this product has held them together for the past 2 days (without a wash in between) and brought back some life to them. The only downside is that it leaves sort of a waxy feel to my hair, so my curls aren't silky by any means despite looking shiny. I guess that's what you forfeit, though, to keep your curls together and frizz-free.
"
"
I asked my friend what product she was using in her hair because it was so beautiful with clearly defined soft waves. This was it. I tried it. I love it. I use it when I'm letting my hair air dry, but I also use it when I blow it out straight. It softens and holds nicely without stickiness. Use sparingly, only a little bit is necessary!
"
"
My absolute favorite styling cream for my curly hair. I have searched for years for a decent product to work with my unruly curls. This, in combination with DevaCurl gel is just what I was looking for! I love it! And it smells good too!
"
"
Using this product has made my hair extremely easy to manage. My curls last up to a week, when applying more it’s not sticky or greasy! Love it!!
"
"
Its okay...  it can be greasy.... not really for hair type 3.... but it smells great....
"
"
Was not impressed. Made my hair look waxy and didn’t keep my curls from frizzing.
"
"
I like this product as well.  It truly does define curls!  My only reservation is that sometimes it makes my hair ""too curly"" and you need to use sparingly.  It does bring the curl out and hold it.  I have been putting in on my hair once it is almost dry (after using a bit of gel and/or deva curl foam) and it provides the final touch.  Again, use very sparingly!
"
"
I had better products for my thick curly hair that are cheaper! This just made my hair very tangledand it made my hair feel crunchy. Would not be ordering this again. Not to mention how small the bottles are!
"
"
I love this styling cream. I have permed hair and unfortunately it's oily so I can't put a lot of product in it or it gets weighed down and doesn't look good. Enter the styling cream it keeps my curls nice but not weighed down, in fact most people think my hair is naturally curly. I would highly recommend any Deva products, I use a slight amount of the styling gel just at the roots of my bangs.
"
"
Great product my curls came to life since I start using it. my hair look after and my curls are defined.
"
"
Not really a fan. I prefery products without any scent and this one has a weird chemically scent. It leaves my hair looking moisturized, but it feels crunchy. Maybe just not for me, unfortunately.
"
"
Love the stuff
"
"
Very good product, specially if you have curly hair! Smells good also.
"
"
I'm surprised at how much I love this product because I've used other DevaCurl products that haven't worked out so well for me.  But this is now one of my favorite styling products and I'm using it regularly.  I have thick, coarse, wavy, almost curly hair.  I need a product to help define my curls and prevent fly-aways.  This does the trick.  And bonus - it smells heavenly.
"
"
I love it, but I still feel like it could moisturize better.  I still use it but would suggest using a curl cream that helps moisturize.
"
"
Love this product. I’ve purchased it many times and I will continue to do so. My hair can be stick straight and extremely curly the next due to this product. The curls are so defined and not sticky or heavy. I love it
"
"
This is pure magic! Puts spring back in my curls without weight or stickiness! Smells so good and is so easy to use!
"
"
It makes my hair really soft, but it looks exactly the same. It didn't add any more definition or take out any of my frizz... I even tried the comb trick in the video and it just made my hair frizzer! Personally mousse has done the best for me.
"
"
Too heavy and waxy.  Couldn't get it thru my hair. :(((
"
"
Very disappointed in this product. It makes my hair very frizzy. I was using too much product at first and my hair felt greasy and frizzy. I used less and my hair didn't feel greasy anymore but was still ridiculously frizzy. Would not recommend to anyone. I wish I had bought the light gel instead.
"
"
Caused my hair to break off severely.
"
"
I Love the way it calms my hair down, my curls tend to get very frizzy and this product really helps
"
"
My niece raves about this product and her hair looks great. She has big natural waves and curls with a tendency to frizz. I bought this for my daughter, who has very tight, dry, frizzy curls that need a lot of moisture. I found this product too heavy and sticky, difficult to work through her hair, but the biggest reason I didn't like it was the SMELL. It reminds me of a port-a-potty air freshener -- honestly. Really awful smell, but maybe it's just me. I know many people love this product, but it wasn't a good match for us!
"
"
What else can I say, I purchased this for my wife on Valentine's Day and she loves it.
"
"
Not my favorite deva curl product. I like the he’ll better. But this is pretty good too, comes in second to the gel.
"
"
My curly-haired son & daughter can't live without this. Its the only product that helps define the curl without frizz or ""crunchiness"".
"
"
Bueno producto
"
"
great product
"
"
Works well but my hair really feels like it has product in it and I'd like the more natural feel
"
"
This works great for my 3b/c curls!
"
"
I have probably tried almost every curl gel, cream, pomade, etc. on the market. Devacurl coconut cream is the absolute best! My curls are soft and frizz free. They’re not crunchy or greasy. Every curl needs devacurl!!!
"
"
Best thing ever, but don't use too much because it will weight down your hair.
"
"
A must buy for every girl with curly hair!!!
"
"
I got a perm due to a shoulder injury.
"
"
I love this stuff. Not my fave smell in the world but I love my smooth curls and how softThey are!
"
"
This cream is amazing, it goes through my hair so easy and moisturized it. It tames frizz and defines my curls. This also smells like candy. I love it and recommend to any curly girl
"
"
Defines my curls perfectly! Just make sure that you are applying to soaking wet hair and diffusing dry from that wet state to dry
"
"
Worked perfect for my daughters hair great price
"
"
I like the concept, it does do a great job with some scrunching but my hair is mostly wavy and by mid day it weighs it down. The smell is fresh. I think sometimes I get weighed down and becomes straight and oily. It does work well just not for very long days. This is all because my personal hair style.
"
"
Love my Devacurl! It curls my hair without the need for heavy gels. I use on damp hair after drying slightly and scrunch up. Lasts all day. Only takes a quarter size amount for my hair.
"
"
Not what I expected.  Heavy cream and did like the smell.It does hold curls, but you have to ""break"" the cast for a softer look.I like other Deva products, such as the Low-Poo shampoo and the One Condition No-Poo Decadence and the Mister-Right.  They do a great job and they smell pleasant.
"
"
Seems to be working well for my naturally curly hair! Helps to not dry it out as much, nice and creamy.
"
"
Would’ve given zero stars if possible. Item was clearly damaged and contents spilled out. Apparently it’s not eligible for a return. Extremely disappointed that I just wasted over 14 dollars on a product I have to throw away.
"
"
I usually wear wash and go with my 3b/3c hair type. The first time i used it looked besutiful but the last time my hair looked dry and frizzy although felt moisturized. I love how soft my hair feels. I think is a great product but maybe more for rod sets or twists
"
"
I'm hispanic with thick, wavy, dry hair. I tried this with the curly girl method and it did not do anything different for me. What worked better was putting a few drops of plain old avocado oil in my hair right after showering.
"
"
I don't like this product on my hair
"
"
Very expensive and doesn't work that well. Mark Anthony curl envy works better and it's only $8
"
"
I mix it with the DevaCurl Angel light hold defining gel, about 25% of the gel to 75% of the cream and I get a really nice hold with super shiny, soft curls. I LOVE the smell.... honestly an amazing scent for hair products.
"
"
I love all DevaCurl products. I work a little dab into my hair right after shampooing and before I blot the extra moisture with paper towels. Keeps the frizz under control.
"
"
This is my new fav hair product. It took a majority of the frizz out of my hair and left defined tight curls. My only complaint is the scent is a bit too fruity and strong for me, but it's not terrible.
"
"
This product works great on my natural curly hair. Feels very thick going on but hold the curl well.
"
"
love what this product does for my wavy hair!
"
"
It works really well on my sons hair
"
"
Super helpful to maintain my crazy-ass, thick, curly hair. Smells like candy too! The only thing is you have to kind of avoid using it near your scalp because it can make your hair look greasy.
"
"
I have thick, course, full hair, and this works great to not only tame the frizz but also the volume. My curls are in control, and my hair feels and looks great now!  The product itself does not clump and does not get crusty once applied.
"
"
Nice cream to help curls.  It doesn't quite do the trick on my fine hair, but that doesn't mean the product isn't good. This is a nice cream, but might be better suited for thicker hair
"
"
Love love love!! Great product I just wish the fragrance stayed around all day.
"
"
Devaconcepts DevaCurl styling cream is a great product and I will use and oder this again.  I was using DevaCurl gel and it took a long time for my hair to dry, and after using DevaCurl styling cream it was a big difference.  My hair dried quickly and my curls were more defined.  Love it.
"
"
My husband has very curly hair and will only use deva products. I think the styling cream is great. It really smooths out his curls, his hair never looks frizzy, just smooth defined curls.
"
"
Finally! A product that can tame my wild waves. I have thick, coarse hair mixed with some fine fly-always, and it controls them all without being greasy or weighing my hair down. Love this stuff!
"
"
Years of searching for curl products and finally this! I use their No-poo, conditioner and then Sytling cream, ultra gel, finish with Set it Free. Great product line for curlyhair
"
"
I have curly/wavy hair (just enough curl past wavy). It's long and can by very very frizzy. When I go get my hair cut, the stylists always want to try to use a diffuser on it, and my hair always ends up looking very clown-ish and they end up using a straightening iron. This cream is the best stuff I have ever used. I switched to no shampoo (only very occasional no-silicon shampoo close to the scalp and then all other times I use all no-silicon conditioners) which helps too. No-poo and low-poo methods are recommended by DevaCurl. But this cream is AWESOME. I just use a little pea-sized amount, rub it through my hair when wet, and let air dry and it looks great. Has a nice sort of fruity smell- not overpowering. You *can* use too much, but after my hair dries the frizz has decreased, and my hair looks very natural. It isn't crispy and the curls are soft. If you want more hold, you should try this brand's ultra defining gel. This one is for a more loose natural look with plenty of movement in the hair. Love this stuff.
"
"
My hair is full, soft, and has defined curls...looks very healthy because it is! Sulfate free product and is the best for your hair. Has a light lemon scent that I'm not crazy about but my hair looks so great, so I still use it.
"
"
I usually use moose to tame my frizz, but this stuff leaves my hair without friz, weightless, and soft feeling. I absolutely love this stuff!
"
"
Love love love this stuff. Works great to style my daughters hair and smells yummy too!
"
"
Not better than other pharmacy products. It is still on my shelf. I went back to my usual products.
"
"
Received product damaged, unable to use and not eligible for a return! What a waste- will not order again
"
"
I like  this product. Does the job.
"
"
Product itself is amazing and I've used it consistently for about a year.However, upon receipt of the product, the top had busted and the product was everywhere in the wrapping. I lost almost half of the product due to the damage of the bottle.
"
"
I have fairly curly/frizzy hair and this product works ok. but the amount i have to use to keep my hair under control is more then i expected. i doubt this amount will last very long. I like that it does not have a super ""wet"" look like other products.
"
"
Love this styling cream. I mix it with the Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defining Gel. I have fine color-treated curly hair and this combination helps to keep the frizz away.
"
"
This is how my product showed up! It’s a complete mess.  Liquid coming out every where.  Not sure how I am supposed to return this.
"
"
Smells great and gives you the curl without the crunch
"
"
Doesn't really do much for my curls and on top of that the bottle came broken so all the product spilled inside the plastic bag it came in....
"
"
I love DevaCurl products and the smell of this cream is delicious! Tames my thick frizzy curls.
"
"
I would give it zero stars if possible.  Do yiur research.  Thia product is causing allergic reactuons, hair damage and loss.
"
"
Great curl cream! If you need a lot of hold for your wavy/curly hair, this is a great option. A little goes a long way. And, as long as you don't use too much, it won't leave your hair sticky.
"
"
Heavy. Does not help w my nAturally curly hair. Makes hair feel greasy. Wouldn't buy again
"
"
deva system is great
"
"
Does not work for my curls.  I like the devacurl foam much better.  I have very curly hair.  Just didn't define or hold up to humidity like the foam does.  Also, felt a little heavy in my hair.
"
"
Leave's  your hair soft.
"
"
This cream is like leave in conditioner, no crunchiness, just soft and smooth.
"
"
Keeps my hair looking fresh for days after washing.  Best of all my hair is silky soft to the touch.  No tackiness or crunch.
"
"
Used this product when my cousin came to visit and immediately purchased on Amazon.  Light on your hair so it doesn't feel like you have a gunk of product weighing down your hair, but holds the curls and controls frizz I definitely recommend this product.
"
"
Love this product. I was using Deva styling gel and switched to the cream. It gives my curls definition and a softness. Wouldn't ever want to run out. I also use it with Deva Condition One. Great combination for nourishing curls.
"
"
I like product. Wish you can get more for your money.
"
"
Delight to use and the smell is beautiful
"
"
This has become a favorite of mine due to having dry (gray), curly hair.  Is not heavy and yet calms down the frizzes!
"
"
Love this product.  I have very tight curls, and this cream is perfect: doesn't weigh them down, no greasy/sticky feel.  Makes my hair look and feel amazing.  And it smells great, too!
"
"
I love this product will purchase again. However, the bottle was leaking when it arrived, which created quite a mess.
"
"
Curly hair you need these products.
"
"
This product is amazing!! It defines my curls beautifully without making them feel crunchy. My hair has no frizz and is soft to the touch. So thankful to have found this product!
"
"
All my friends love it.  I did not.
"
"
Bought this for my girlfriend, she loved it and she will buy again! Enough said.
"
"
Simple, clean, and a soft hold.  Mix with the gel to get a nice all day look.
"
"
Leaves a thick residue on your hair. Didn't like the product but everything arrived well packaged.
"
"
Left my hair dry and frizzy moisture only lasted a few hours and I was left with undefined curls
"
"
Best curl product I've used for styling so far! The smell of this product is so amazing!!
"
"
This is a bit heavy...by the end of the day my natural curls are weighed down...nice smell though
"
"
My hair finally looks hydrated after using this. My curly hair was out of control until I ordered this! So glad I found this!
"
"
Best curl creme for my coarse, curly hair.
"
"
Wonderful quality!! Hair looks great!! I use this product on damp hair, then blowdry and use hotrollers! Love the volume and body it gives my hair!!
"
"
no sirve
"
"
Best thing I’ve ever used for naturally curly hair!
"
"
I have curly hair and cannot begin my day without this product. It helps my hair hold the curls without getting frizzy. Just scrunch it through the hair, throw it back and gently finger style.
"
"
I have kinky curls and have used every curly hair product out there.  I use this everyday and my curls have never looks better!

Nice freshner for curly hair between shampoos.
"
"
wife says it works great
"
"
I have thick curly hair and I swear by the DevaCurl brand!! This stuff has saved my hair and I have gained control of my curls. Love the styling cream and the smell of it is wonderful. I would recommend to anyone who is wanting to tame their curls and get rid of the frizz.
"
"
Awesome product! I have wavy, thick and coarse hair and this product enhances my natural waves, tames frizz, and doesn't make my hair crunchy. I have also tried Bumble & Bumble's Texture cream, but I prefer the DevaCurl cream as it doesn't leave my hair feeling stiff and crunchy.
"
"
Makes my curls look soft yet full
"
"
I don't have curly hair, but this product works really well to fluff up my thin hair and give it extra body!
"
"
I like the definition and moisture this gives to my curls.  I use a gel over it for maximum frizz prevention (which I do with any curling creme I've ever used), but with this product, my curls do not end up weighted down as happens with many other products I have used (I have Botticelli curls).
"
"
Perfect product for curly hair during the summer. It's a little heavier since it's a cream and it helps weight my hair down enough in the dry months. I typically switch to the foam in the winter.
"
"
Gift received with excitement by curly headed granddaughter.
"
"
Tries this after getting a diva cut at a local salon, and it makes such a huge difference. My hair doesn't feel weighed down or sticky and the curl is even throughout. I love this stuff!
"
"
I absolutely love this product, I consider myself a product junkie, I've been trying to find a product for my course frizzy curly hair and I think I finally found the products that gets the job done! Since I'm transitioning it makes my hair really soft and doesn't weigh it down! It smells amazing which is an added bonus!
"
"
This is the best product for curly and tangly hair.  Made my daughter's hair easy to comb.  Woudnt use anything else.  5 plus stars!!
"
"
This is my favorite DevaCurl product.  My curls and be hard to manage and I'm happiest with them when I use this product.
"
"
I found this hair gel to not work well for my hair. It didn't seem to have a great hold on my curls. My curls were very fragile while wet and too loose when they dried. Maybe this is because I don't have supe r
"
"
Love this stuff!!! Endless good hair days and healthier hair!
"
"
I am very pleased with this purchase. It does wonders for my frizzy hair. I will say it does smell like skittles.
"
"
I use this product all the time.  It really helps keep the frizz down.  I usually purchase it at the salon for a significant amount more.
"
"
Bottle completely busted open in box on arrival.  Product wasted.  Maybe y'all.should tape the cap closed when shipping.
"
"
First time using this product, I wasn't sure how long it'd last. I use it pretty much everyday and have at least half of it left and I ordered this July 31, 2015 (so, almost 8 months). A little bit goes a long way. I use this after using their no-poo and one condition products in the shower, spray on Set It Free, then scrunch this Styling Cream into my curls, focusing on the ends/not my scalp so that it doesn't weigh down my curls. I then use a little bit of their Light Defining Gel to scrunch everything into place. My hair isn't sticky or overly crunchy as long as I don't use too much of anything.I've used this product on my 2nd day hair to give it a bit of a boost and I honestly don't see much of a difference but it does make my hair smell GREAT! The less you touch your hair after styling while using this product, you'll find that it really helps control frizz!
"
"
Arrived broken with product all over bag.  Can't rate actual product at this time
"
"
I used this at my sisters' house and fell in love with it. My hair feels soft and not stiff when I use this and there is no frizz!!!
"
"
When I initially converted to CG, I used only gel. I had curl, but my hair was so damaged that I wasn't getting the curls I remembered having when I was younger. I bought this product after reading the reviews, and I LOVE it. After scrunching out the excess water with a tee shirt, I apply a moderate amount of this then follow up with a generous amount of gel. Using too much of this will result in a slightly greasy look, so be careful. This product bundles my curls nicely and makes 'em shine, while the gel adds protein and sets my curls in place. (For gel, I either use the Angel or Aussie Instant Freeze, if I need a harder hold.) I highly recommend this product in conjunction with gel, especially if you are transitioning to natural.
"
"
Makes your hair fall out
"
"
The cream is little too creamy and feel heavy on the hair.
"
"
I was disappointed in this entire line of products. I have very long, thick & kinky curly hair. Before my purchase I would just put conditioner in my hair & defuse it. I was hoping the devacul line would do ""better"" than my Suave $2.00 bottle of conditioner. NO! The product smells good & makes my hair soft, but that's it. So if your thinking about forking over a fortune for this line.... I wouldn't. It's not at all, worth it.
"
"
Can no longer use Deva Curl products due to hair loss from it.
"
"
Best product ever for great curls that feel natural. Curls hold without frizz! Love it!
"
"
Awesome for people with curly hair
"
"
love it!
"
"
this stuff smells exactly like the generic/orange softsoap hand soap they have in my office and i just can’t do it.
"
"
I love this product because it does what it promises to do. My hair is manageable and soft to the touch. My curls look amazing too.
"
"
Great! Would buy again.
"
"
Good product just small and expensive
"
"
Smells like skittles! Also works great to define and tame the curls!
"
"
I definitely see some more definition in my curls!
"
"
I liked it, it gives the hair a very smooth and soft look. But nothing really different with other products I have try. Will give a second chance with other products of the same line but by itself it doesnt really work that well.
"
"
Box arrived with things open and the curl cream bottle broken and spilled.
"
"
Excellent product for curly hair.  It arrived in the time frame given, and with no damage.I would order it again.
"
"
Product is a perfect styler.
"
"
Perfect curl cream!  Never disappointed
"
"
Definitely smells like skittles, but it works. The smell goes away after a while though.
"
"
Works good for my hair!
"
"
I love this stuff! It lets me go curly without my hair being sticky, heavy, or crunchy. It is light enough to comb through and my hair always feels clean, no weighed down.
"
"
Love this product!  Gives me natural looking, soft, defined curls.  Not too heavy or sticky, smells a little like candy!
"
"
This stuff is alright. It smells good, and the concept is good, but I think using the conditioner as a leave in works better.
"
"
My hair is unruly and so is my niece's hair but this helped us both out a lot. I'm a hair dresser and it was recommended to me by a client lol and so glad she did.
"
"
Let me make it clear. THIS IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN. I was recommended this brand by my hairdresser who also has curly hair. I wanted the va-va-voom hair without the witch-frizz. This is it! Yes, it is a little pricier than drugstore but it is so worth it. I have long hair and I only use about two pumps for my whole head. In NY; during summer I scrunch and go (let it air dry) so it gives me voluminous yet a little beachy curls and during winter I scrunch and diffuse and its great. Also, it smells like heaven. I will buy more once I run out.
"
"
This version was much more “liquidy” than previous versions. Disappointing.
"
"
Very good product, only need to use a tiny bit.
"
"
Love DevaCurl products.  This is a must!
"
"
It helps to create curl without leaving your hair crunchy or weighed down.
"
"
I have really naturally curly hair, and this is not to crunchy, but gives my hair the perfect amount of volume and smells fabulous. Try it!
"
"
This product is great for curly hair..and I love the smell-smells like skittles!
"
"
Lost alot of my hair and live my hair dry
"
"
This is an excellent product for my ype of hair and when my daughter was visiting from Santa Monica she usedit and really liked the way it made her hair look and feel, so I ordered some for her.
"
"
I love this product
"
"
This product has been a godsend. It works super well with my curls (3c) and is very hydrating but light. My hair is versatile and not weighed down by a heavy curl product.  I am a huge fan of Deva products but this is my favorite thus far.
"
"
I have very curly hair , and have tried hundred of products for my hair! I have to say that Deval Curl Styling Cream is the best out there!
"
"
GREAT OFR MY CURLY HAIR
"
"
Finally a curl cream that doesn't make my hair crunchy and keeps the curls for days. LOVE THIS,
"
"
The perfect solution for curly hair that is also fine.  Defines the curls without weighing them down.  It's great!
"
"
it's ok.  makes my hair a little sticky.  they have better products.  I use their no poo shampoo and one conditioner.  they are great
"
"
really brings out the curls, leaves hair a bit crispy but overall a really great product, I will buy again
"
"
Makes hair so soft, I am very curly and love this new product. I. Use it all the time now combined with my angel gel.
"
"
I have thick curly hair, a 3A I would say.  This stuff left it dull and dry looking with absolutely no bounce and no shine.  The texture is terrible and I can't wait to wash it out!!!
"
"
I've started using this along with the Deva mousse instead of using the Deva gel.  The gel was kind of making my hair heavy and dull.  This works better for me  - especially for 2nd and 3rd day hair.  I live in Colorado and have long, spiral curls and keep trying different Deva products. The styling cream is a keeper.  Don't have to use a ton, either.  Usually 3 pumps worked in right out of the shower; mousse about 20 minutes afterwards.
"
"
Love, love, love this product!
"
"
This is an awesome product that gives me NO frizz. I have tried at least 10 other brands and this is the one that always gives me the best coverage for soft, touchable waves.
"
"
Love this for my curly hair! Eliminates frizz without being crunchy.
"
"
I really like this new curling cream from DevaCurl.  After years of blowdrying I finally decided to embrace my natural curl.  However, the road to finding the right products has been long and disappointing at times.  I use this after spraying in a leave in conditioner.  I use about the size of a quarter or a bit more and work it through my hair using a large tooth comb to be sure that all the hair is coated.  I then dry with the diffuser.  I like this cream better than gels because it doesn't give my hair that crunch.
"
"
It was exactly what i needed
"
"
Great product for curly hair. Gives moisture with out a leaving hair greasy.
"
"
It works
"
"
Wonderful for controlling the frizz of curly hair. Leaves hair soft, not crunchy.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Finally gave me the definition and non-crunchy curls I've been dreaming of.
"
"
works great to minimize the frizz from my curly hair - love it!
"
"
Great
"
"
This keeps makes my curls spiral and soft. I would give it a 5 if it had a better pump.
"
"
This product is for my wife, so I'm not exactly sure how it works, but he keeps her happy and that keeps me very happy.
"
"
Mix this with deva curl's arc angel and put them in your hair together. Great results!
"
"
Did not work
"
"
I really love this product. It brings out all my natural curls & you only need 1 pump of it. Any more than that would be too much product.
"
"
this is great for curly hair. helps tone down frizziness and enhance curl
"
"
Love every DevaCurl product I've tried.  This DevaCurl Styling Cream layers on after gel for even more control and beautiful curls.
"
"
Try it!
"
"
great!
"
"
Makes hair feel manageable. Does not keep hair from being frizzy.
"
"
I love it
"
"
good product, does the curl thing nicely
"
"
Good product.
"
"
This really helps keep my curls from being too frizzy in humid weather.  I use it every day.  Will buy more.
"
"
wonderful creamy soft curls!  use daily and love it
"
"
I love this curl cream!
"
"
DevaCurl Styling Cream is my very favorite styling product.  It alleviates dryness!  I've had people ask if I have naturally curly hair.
"
"
It works pretty well and has an amazing scent, however, after it dries, it leaves your hair stiff
"
"
This styling cream has a wonderful scent and a smooth, non-greasy feeling.  It helps with setting my waves without the crunchy, greasy look of a gel.  It also makes my hair very soft.  Very happy I gave it a try!
"
"
Recommended by a friend and I'm glad I listened.  Awesome product that leaves my hair soft and natural looking.  Buy it here at Amazon, other beauty supply places sell them for more $$.
"
"
Best thing in the world for curly hair. All the Deva products are fantastic!
"
"
Love this cream to keep my curly hair from frizzing.  Highly recommend this product.
"
"
I like product
"
"
I love how this product makes my curls look but, the smell gives me a headache. I’ll be giving this away...
"
"
I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.It's a super addition and it smells terrific too!
"
"
Makes my hair shiny but doesn't have hardly any hold.
"
"
I have curly dry mature caucasian hair and this product does help tame frizz but I find it leaves a bit of a gummy feel to my hair.
"
"
Love, love this product if you have natural curly or wavy hair.  It smells wonderful and gives me soft touchable curls and waves and lasts for days.
"
"
Gives me such nice curls....I have to perm my hair but this keeps the curls longer...
"
"
Holds curls without looking greasy.
"
"
Great for curly hair.  Doesn't dry it out,  leave it sticky or crunchy.
"
"
Best curl defining cream ever!
"
"
It works and without stiffness - yay!
"
"
This is the one and only product that works for my frizzy,curly, unruly hair. Just a small amount on my hands smoothed down the length of my hair, wet or dry, gives me the soft,spiraly curls I've always wanted. I'm on my second package of this product and I still love it as much as I first did! I recommend and will continue using!
"
"
My faborito
"
"
Great product
"
"
I love this product!!!! I can not get enough of it. I have curly long hair that tends to freeze easily. Since I started using this product, my hair looks healthier and everybody comments how pretty my curls are. It has helped me embrace my curly hair. It also moisturizers it. It is worth very penny!
"
"
Works well to control curls without frizz.
"
"
GREAT product. Delivered on time and not left where dog could get to it before me.
"
"
Makes my hair look great!
"
"
My daughter loved her gift.
"
"
Tames my frizzy curls for sure.  Doesn't feel too heavy and is not sticky. This ones a keeper and believe me I've been through a lot of products and most don't work!
"
"
long time used of this product.  I have very curly hair and hate the ""crunchy"" feel to some products.  This cream leaves my hair soft while still defining my curl
"
"
Works great on my curly hair!
"
"
Love
"
"
I actually really like this cream underneath a gel for hold. The smell is great, and it's super lightweight. Not sure if I would buy again, but I'd probably come back to it if I wasn't finding anything else I liked better (since it's pretty pricey).
"
"
I had high hopes for this product based on other reviews and I really wanted to love it. However, I was highly disappointed.  I have very coarse, curly, and relatively thick hair. This cream left my hair with a very weird texture and seemed to make my hair bigger after a few hours which I certainly don't need. My hair also seemed to tangle more easily after I applied it and it did not control my frizz AT ALL. The other thing I did not like is the fragrance. I am not picky about scents, but this had a very strong smell that I didn't like. I have tried so many products for curly hair and this was one of the worst. For being pretty expensive, this product was a huge disappointment.
"
"
This really works good on my naturally waves to set them in.
"
"
This is my absolute favorite product for my curls. It keeps my hair soft and hydrated and tamed without that weird wet look and crunchy feeling of a gel. I use this product every day and get complements on my curly hair all the time!
"
"
I have shoulder length corkscrew curls and this product works wonders for my hair! I used to use the anGEL but didn't like how ""crunchy"" it would leave my hair with the gel casts and I felt that it was drying my hair out too much (might have just been me being paranoid). I tried the Styling Cream on a whim and fell in love. It doesn't make my hair have the ""crunchy"" feel and keeps my frizz at bay for hours (I'm a nurse in the ICU and I don't have frizz after a twelve hour shift). I apply it the same why that I applied the anGEL with my head down, coating the underside and then flipping my hair over while doing a light coat over the sides and scrunching. I also use the spray gel on my roots just to keep it from looking too big and 80's style. Just a light quick few sprays it enough and doesn't have the ""crunchy"" feel either.
"
"
One of my favorite Deva products, I use this and the DevaCare One Condition. Amazing product line for naturally curly, color treated hair.
"
"
love this have thick wavy/curly hair
"
"
It styles my hair without the stiffness.  I prefer it to the gels.
"
"
Great Product!!
"
"
A little thick for my taste.  Doesnt make my hair feel good.
"
"
This is the best product I have ever used on my curly hair and I am the queen of hair and beauty products.  Best curls EVER!!!
"
"
Excelllent product for Curly Girls!
"
"
Good product.  Does not weigh my curls down.
"
"
Nice, natural curls, not crunchy, smells fantastic.
"
"
Great for naturally curly hair that tends to frizz
"
"
Love this stuff! Gives my curls so much moisturize. Wonderful in the summer, and an absolute MUST during the winter months.
"
"
Love this after I style with gel
"
"
Defines curls. Doesn't weigh hair down. Doesn't do much for shine.
"
"
I have thick, wavy ""2b"" hair and use this product together with Deva's Set It Free.  The Styling Cream provides hold while the Set It Free adds shine.  Originally, I applied the two separately but now I pre-mix them together in the ratio that is perfect for my hair type.  I scrunch it on when my hair is wet and then literally don't touch my hair for the rest of the day (key for fighting frizz).  Although I still have the occasionally ""bad hair day,"" pretty consistently these products in combination produce soft, shiny waves.  It is sort of funny that between the Styling Cream and the Set It Free, you hair smells like a candy shop for a hot minute, but that quickly dissipates. Four stars instead of five, only because I wish one product did it all and because these products are expensive. That said, Amazon is offering this cream at well below drug store prices and I will repurchase here.
"
"
Did not work well on my fine permed hair. It weighted my hair down and left it with a greasy type film.Would not buy this product again, not happy that I paid this much for a product and can not use!
"
"
Best product for curly waving hair out there on the market. You can use it when damp and add a little when your hair is dry to liven up your curls.
"
"
The Deva styling cream is the best leave in conditioner I've ever tried.  After gently towel drying my hair, I put a tiny dab (the first time, I used too much -- my hair felt heavy and sort of greasy so don't use too much) and run it through my hair.  That's all it takes -- great, non-frizzy curls that feel soft.  It's really a wonderful product!
"
"
Meh. Not impressed.
"
"
Got this as a sample from Sephora and loved it!  Have not been able to find it in the stores and love that I can order it on Amazon and save a little money along the way as well.
"
"
I have tried it all and this is the best. I also like redken curls, the original formula which is gone, and cat curls curling creme which is also great but this is the best of all of them.  I used it with the deva diffuser and I had corkscrew curls all over which I never had before. This Deva brand is perfection, so happy I found it on amazon😃😃😃😃
"
"
this is a great heavy moisture cream for curls. it keeps the frizz away, but doesn't weight them down or make them feel greasy. a little goes a looonnng way!
"
"
LOVE this stuff!!
"
"
Love this! I tried it when I got a haircut at a Deva inspired salon and fell in love. It smells like Skittles to me and gives me solid curls for 3-4 days. I was using One Condition as a leave in and it was good but gave me breakouts. This has been a fantastic upgrade for me. I think it is a bit pricey BUT my curls stay cute for at least 3 days (got 5 days one time). Absolutely will buy this again!
"
"
Just wonderful, leaves hair smelling nice, offers good amount of control
"
"
Great styling cream for my wavy curls! I like to combine this product with a small amount of devacurl hair gel for extra hold.
"
"
Love this product. Can use it on wet or dry hair. Makes such a difference in keeping my curls just the way I want them.
"
"
Product smells good, but that's about all it has going for it. Doesn't bring out my curls and doesn't reduce frizz at all. Disappointed.
"
"
The package came with the cream exploded in the box! Since I saw at least review with the same problem, I'm not even going to risk ordering it again.
"
"
Love this product line. This is the first product that I've found that defines curls and still has my hair feeling nice.
"
"
Great power in helping curls stay all day.
"
"
Great product , would definitely buy another one ...Smells great and won't feel greasy on your hair!!!
"
"
I can not say enough about this styling cream!  I use the whole product line! The no poo cleanser and conditioner!  All well worth the money!!
"
"
Awesome product really clean and holds my curls
"
"
If you have curly hair you know you need product to bring out the bestf of your curls.  DevaCurl Styling Cream is a must have for curly girls.  I have a Boteccili curl type of hair and this product brings out the boing in my curl.  I part my hair in 4 sections and use 1 pump for each section... I either dry with a diffuser or air dry... I get compliments every time!
"
"
Love this product! Nothing else works better for curly hair. Would recommend this to anyone with frizzy or curly hair. Thank you
"
"
I don't usually write reviews but this product left me no choice. It's worth every penny. I'm a guy with dry, frizzy, curly hair that I was afraid to grow out. I spent hours researching and well over $100 on ways to keep it hydrated, moisturized, and tame. I ended up with a 5-product regimen that left me scrambling for work in the morning, only to find my hair unruly and back with a vengeance by the noon lunch hour.Deva curl has ended all of that. With a single product, my hair stays styled, hydrated, and healthy throughout the day. DC humidity is no joke, but it has met its match here. My curls bounce, shine, and rock their bad selves all day long. Do your hair a favor and give it this godly nectar.
"
"
Tried many products, this one is the best. I love the smell!
"
"
No Poo, One Condition, then the stylin cream.  This trio has transformed my curls into something I love to show off now!
"
"
This is the first time I have used this product and I love it.  It really helps define my curls.
"
"
always love DevaCurl
"
"
Don't have to use much; it handles the curls beautifully. Not 'crunchy' to the touch!
"
"
Great product! My daughter absolutely loves it. She uses it with the spray gel and her hair looks great. She also loves the smell of it.
"
"
It is the perfect hair product for anyone with naturally curly hair!!! I hate the look of wet curls, so I search often on a good product for a natural look.  This is the PERFECT product!!! Worth the money!
"
"
This cream is good but I have to use with other products to really define my hair the way I like it.
"
"
The Deca Curl Styling cream is perfect to give shape to my curls, making them last the whole day! it also smells delicious!
"
"
The bottle came cracked open.
"
"
I love this styling cream so much. I use it in combination with DevaCurl One Condition as a leave in conditioner, and apply it to my hair while it's still soaking wet, then air dry. It leaves my hair so soft and smooth and tames frizz pretty well, but doesn't weigh it down or leave it hard like most gels or products do. Once my hair dries I scrunch it a bit and fluff it up to break it up and it's so soft and fluffy but still controlled. This is my second bottle and I will use this forever!
"
"
It seems to keep my hair from frizzing.
"
"
Love this! I can even straighten my hair and it give it a healthy look!
"
"
Love, love, love this cream.  Makes my hair so soft, curly and frizz free.  I use it with the Devacurl Gel. I really cannot believe how well this works for my very curly, kinda thin but lots of blond hair.  I so recommend all 3 of the Devacurl products I bought.  Cream, gel and mist er Right!
"
"
I am sure glad I found this product. Together with SET IT FREE my hair never felt or looked so good.
"
"
I really like that Deva now has a cream but I do not like that it only lasts for a short period of time compared to the cost. It didn't hold my hair as well as I would have liked but overall it's great if I use in generously. Unfortunately I ran out quickly within a few weeks, (my hair is mid back length) Too expensive.
"
"
This is the best product I have ever used, after trying and using hundreds for many years.Does what it says and it is not sticky or leave a film. Just 2 pumps for my long hair. Scrunch as your drying and it dries very curly. I have straight fine hair and it works beautifully.
"
"
I've been using this cream in conjunction with the Devacurl shampoo and conditioner (which I like) and have found this product to be VERY disappointing. I am Caucasian and have moderately tight, spiral curls. While this cream does hold the curl, it does absolutely nothing for the frizz. In fact, my $3 drug store mousse is infinitely better at keeping frizz at bay than this cream. I am extremely disappointed as the product does not do what it claims to.
"
"
This creams makes my hair feel amazing.
"
"
I feel like this product is fake. I have used this before but I purchased it at a department store locally. This one is completely different and I truly suspect it's fake.
"
"
Curly girls and boys, this styling cream works amazingly well! It's a small bottle, but it goes a long way. I have thick corkscrew and botticelli curls that have too much volume sometimes.My routine consists of smoothing 2-3 pumps of this over my hair immediately after I turn off the water in the shower. I also use DevaCare defining gel to help keep the frizz at bay and prevent fly-aways, but it's the styling cream that helps my curls from turning into a terrible 90s afro.
"
"
Great product, have been using it for years
"
"
Wife's hair less frizzy and healthier looking. Curls more defined
"
"
I have curly frizzy hair. It frizzie's if I do nothing but curls when I use a curling produce.  I have always gotten complements on the health of my hair by my hair dresser, after a little over a month of using this produce she was very worried about me because my hair went from being healthy and manageable  to extremely dry and notted at the ends. She thought that maybe I had life problems and was very stressed out, but the truth was that nothing was different in my life except that I was trying and new shampoo and conditioner and style produce.
"
"
Leaves my hair super curly and soft! Love it.
"
"
It makes you hair so soft!!!
"
"
Works great!!!!! Love it
"
"
This is a must-have to use alongside the DevaCurl Ultra-Defining Gel. It gives me hold, but softens my curls, and I don't need to use as much when I use it in tandem with the gel. I'm a die-hard DevaCurl user -- their products are life-changing!
"
"
Perfect for towel dried curly hair, makes curly hair light without weighing it down!
"
"
great, enhances my short curls
"
"
It is unremarkable. Same as drug store products.
"
"
Great product! Great price!!
"
"
If you have dark hair, don't buy it.  The product is white and it leaves little clumps of white in your hair.  No matter how I apply the product, and I have tried several different ways, I get white clumps every time.
"
"
Adds moisture to my hair and reduces frizz.
"
"
The best for natural curls!!
"
"
Great product!

Love, Love This styling cream. First thing I have found that actually keeps my curls under control all day. Other styling solutions seem to dry out my hair and eventually the frizz is all you see.Please don't stop making this product....must have for all of us curly girls.
"
"
I have frizzy curly hair and this helps control it and make it soft and manageable. I highly recommend it.
"
"
I love this product!! If you have naturally curly hair, you'll want this before blow drying with a diffuser.
"
"
Great product for summer curly hair!
"
"
Easy styling cream leaving hair both soft and manageable.
"
"
Great product.
"
"
This product is perfectly suited for my naturally curly hair.  It helps eliminate frizz while enhancing the curls.  It also smells delicious.
"
"
My curls are much softer and shines love these products
"
"
great
"
"
this is my first time to use this styling cream based on other people's reviews. it did all it said. make my hair hair, styling, non-frizz.
"
"
My daughter love it
"
"
have not started this bottle yet but have used it in the past. It is certainly better than most of the curl creams I have used but I still prefer the Morrocian Oil curl cream. This is more reasonably priced and easier to get.
"
"
DevaCurl Styling Cream - 5.1 Oz is anmazing for wonderful curls but no tacky stiff hair. Easy to use and good for your hair too!
"
"
It smells like Skittles and I love the scent but I'm not really sure it does anything for my hair. I have permed hair. I use it because of the smell but I have to use other products to hold the curl. It probably works best if your hair is naturally curly.
"

I have been using Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Defining Creme for many years and LOVE IT, but they stopped making it in the liter bottle, so I thought I'd give something cheaper a try before I went out and bought the regular bottles in bulk. I have a friend with curly hair who loves DevaCurl products and I thought I'd give it a shot.  Bad idea.First of all, this product smells awful.  It reminds me of something a tween girl would spray all over herself before going to the movies.  And the product itself didn't define my curls or fight frizz at all.  Instead, it left my hair with this terrible aroma and styled in a droopy, waxy coif.  I have extremely tight, curly hair; perhaps this would be better for those ladies who have loose curls or waves.  If you have tight, corkscrew curls, however,  or if you prefer not to make people nauseated every time the breeze blows through your locks, I'd save my money.  Looks like I'll be sticking to my one true hair love, Bumble and Bumble.
"
"
My hairdresser suggested it because I get knots under the back of my hair since it's very curly.  I think it helps.  I also use a little when my hair gets frizzy but I don't want to wet it.  It soaks in after a while and tames it, not greasy.
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
It's so-so but I feel like for the price you can find similar products with nice Deva-like ingredients for less.
"
"
Packaged well and product as described and expected.
"
"
Great product for curly hair!
"
"
I have been using DevaCurl products from over a year now and I ordered this in placed of the Volumizing Foam. I haven't gone back. Love the cream, it cuts down on frizz and is much more moisturizing without being greasy.
"
"
makes my curls soft and springy!
"
"
This stuff is wonderful.  It smells great and works great.  Makes hair smell incredible and hold curls, it doesn't make hair stiff and crunchy and keeps the frizz at bay.  Now I just wish that the cleansing conditioner smelled this good and maybe I could use it.  The price of this is much better than the Wen styling cream and exactly what I was looking for.
"
"
Nice and moist but still makes hair stiff
"
"
I was an adult before I discovered Deva Curl products and I wish I would've had them in my life sooner! They are the only products that work on my curly hair! No frizz and no crust! I recommend these products to every person I know who has curly hair, male or female!
"
"
Deva Curl makes great products! The styling cream is my favorite. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
"
"
Love this cream for in between styling of my very curly hair. Turns frizz into curl; the curl lasts a long time. Looks perfect in humid or dry weather.
"
"
This product, in conjunction with DevaCurl One Condition, does a great job of enhancing my curl pattern without leaving my hair ""crunchy"" like some other products do. It's a great part of my styling routine.
"
"
My son has corkscrew-curly hair down past his shoulders. Nothing seemed to control it until this. Thank you!
"
"
I have thick curly blonde hair, and have written many a review on here for curly-girl products.  I think I've managed to finally tame the beast with Deva-Curl products, and a few amazing haircuts at the Deva-style dry cut salons.  1) never shampoo, 2) use your fingers to comb through with conditioner, never use a comb or brush, 3) flip hair over and apply styling cream to hold curl and maintain moisture, 4) coat curls in silicone-free gel, 5) remove excess moisture with a cotton t-shirt.  Voila! Perfect soft no-frizz curls
"
"
This cream is amazing! I've used it only once, but it definitely reduced my frizz (to almost zero!) and it doesn't leave your curls with a sticky feeling. They feel so soft and smell so good! Definitely get this if you want beautiful frizz-free and defined curls <3
"
"
Not happy. This is how I received my product today.
"
"
Doesn't do much for my hair. My hair is curly with the tendency to be overly frizzy. It tames it some -- but not as much as I'd like.
"
"
I've tried a lot  of products for curly hair that haven't worked. DevaCurl  styling cream is the best!  It  moisturizes as it holds your curls and lasts for 2 to 3 days when using lavender water to refresh curls in the morning.
"
"
Beware Celiac Sufferers! This product contains wheat. I purchased this cream only to find out that I can't even use it. I will be returning it asap. This is very disappointing for curly heads with gluten intolerance's who want their curls tamed. I am sure this product would work wonderfully, and I hope they can reformulate to make it gluten free!
"
"
I wish they would sell this in a jar or bigger bottles! It's a good styling cream and it smells nice like lemons but the smell doesn't heavily linger in your hair if you're not big on scents. This product isn't very big on MOISTURIZING the hair as much as I would like so I suggest going in with a good leave-in conditioner. Also, do not use on dry hair, it works best on soaking wet hair, at least for me.I will say, it's not entirely worth the money in my opinion only because I know a cheaper styler that does a better job but it is a good product. I could see myself buying it again when my hair gets longer. I currently have a 3C/ 4A TWA.
"
"
Works I guess, but the smell is so distracting.
"
"
Does't work at all, dry my hair, make them puffy and frizzy, not curly and hydrated.I do not like the smell, it's like a marshmallow candle, not natural and overwhelming.Also I had an allergy with burns on my scalps.I think due to alcohol  and I am also very sensitive to it
"
"
Cannot live without this stuff. Taken me from hair despair to hair envy. Women stop me on the street to ask what I use to give me great curls. Tossed out my flat iron and no more straightening marathons.
"
"
love this product!
"
"
The cream does help to defines curls, my hair was not soft and bouncy. It actually felt a lot dry after using the product.
"
"
Wonderful product. I am very picky about products going into my hair BUT this product is one of a kind. Defines and sculpts the curls wonderfully.
"
"
Best curly hair product around
"
"
Some clear liquid was all over it, inside cap, and you can see it floating inside at the bottom under the cream.
"
"
Products came in time and were as described.
"

I ordered this product on June 18th, and received in June 20th.  I couldn't believe I got it so fast.  Then when I opened the package - there were gifts!!  Hair clips, round brush, and an up do thingy!I have long, unruly curly hair.  Everything will come in handy, and I didn't have to go with ""ugly hair"" waiting for my product.I have found that DevaCurl Styling cream REALLY helps to ease the frizz.Thank you so much shampooguy!!
"
"
It's a perfect cream for curly hair. It's light and doesn't weigh down your curls.
"
"
Product arrived on time and undamaged.

Love it!

She says it makes her hair celebrity status worthy. And I think she looks great too! Try it and you will see!

For the past several years I had been straightening my curly hair even though I prefer the curls. That was because it was mostly unmanageable and frizzy, and would usually start looking strange and lose its bounce by the third week from the products I used.I decided to try the DevaCurl line, and started with the One Conditioner and the Angel gel. It looked alot better than before, but the gel was making my hair dry. I was advised to switch to the leave-in and the styling cream instead of the gel.I have been using it now for several months, and it's looking healthier and healthier.I wash my hair with the low poo, then add the conditioner. I wash some of the conditioner out but leave most of it. I use a paper towel to get rid of the dripping water, or use my hands, then I immediately add in a good chunk of leave-in conditioner. I use the styling cream after and blow dry it with a diffuser (much better curl definition than letting it air-dry). Looks great for at least two days. I sometimes use the mister to put some bounce back into it on the 2nd or 3rd day.I usually don't use gels or products that make my hair feel unnatural, and when I was told to use all these products I was worried it might weigh my curls down or feel gunky, but it doesn't at all. Hope this review helps.
"

This is a lightweight conditioning creme that helps fight the frizz.  I have boticelli curls that are shoulder length and it gives the conditioning without the weight of a leave in conditioner.  Hair dries fast and doesn't feel slimey.  You can also use it if straightening hair as well.
"
"
HorribleMade my hair super puffy
"
"
when I got the product it was opened and it spilled on the box. the cantainor was broken. but I love the product itself
"

I usually don't write reviews but, the Deva Curl product line has me over the top in love. I have very curly, frizzy, out of control hair. I have it cut short now so if I don't have a lot of product on it, you could just call me Bozo the clown head. I've used many products throughout the years. Most recently would be the very expensive Loreal salon product line Kerastase. Their products are very expensive and I would have to combine several of them to achieve any kind of control. Just recently my stylist moved to a new salon. Usually, the stylists all have perfectly straight blown out hair or promote blow-outs, the straightening methods, etc. Well, in this salon, all the stylists (except for maybe 1 or 2) had curly hair of varying degree. I mentioned it to my stylist. She thought it was odd, too. Come to find out they all used Deva Curl. They all loved the way it enhanced their natural curl and REALLY, who wants to stand in front of a mirror and blow dry their hair?? We live in South Florida. I had a lesson one day on how to use the product. I use the Low POO shampoo and Low POO conditioner. I only wash once a week or even once every other week. I use the Melt in Moisture conditioner, as a deep conditioner first after I shampoo because curly hair needs moisture. Curly hair is different. Then I use the Low POO conditioner and I don't rinse it all the way out. Then while I'm in the shower and my hair is still dripping wet without wringing it out in any way, I pump 3-4 pumps of the Deva Curl Styling Cream into my hand. I flip my hair over (while soaking wet) and scrunch the product into the ends so that it makes a wet scrunching noise. I don't put it on the roots. This is what I was instructed to do by the stylist who went to Deva Curl seminar by the company. After the product is in your hair you are to wrap your hair with a super absorbent type towel that doesn't promote frizz. Actually, Deva Curl sells this type of towel. They also encourage you to put pins in your hair, not bobby pins, but sort of old fashioned type small metal clips to help set your hair if you have trouble spots. All I can say is that it has worked THE BEST for me. It's the least expensive product I've used in a very very long time. I wet my hair very morning and do the ritual previously explained. Don't get me wrong, nothing is problem free, but this stuff and the other products in this line are FANTASTIC!!
"
"
I first tried this in January 2016 and I have been using it ever since! My hair is soft, not crunchy and it smells GREAT! Whenever I hug someone they say, ""You  smell good!""  my hair is almost halfway down my back and I only use two pumps in my hair. Sometimes I will spray a little big sexy hair spray in it, but usually I do not use anything else with it. I won't ever buy anything else!
"
"
Okay so I decided to buy this product a week ago. I did not have many expectations because my hair is wavy (not the nice wavy)However I got it because of the amazing reviews by other girls with wavy hair and because I wanna be able to take a shower and just go out instead of spending hours in the bathroom either straightening it or curling it.So the first day it did nothing to my hair, other than leaving it a little stiff, just like all the other curling creams I have tried before.But I didn't give up. I decided to keep using it every morning after showering. Its been a week and my hair is curling!!!!!!!!After a week my hair appears to be healthier, shinier and curls are starting to form.! This thing is amazing! I'm so happy I got it.I don't have any other DevaCurl products, just this one because they are a bit pricey. But this is definitely worth it. I totally recommend it.
"
"
This cream works well on my curls if my hair is moisturized. If my hair is dryer than normal it still is a little fizzy even with this cream. I won't buy it again because the smell of it makes me ill. To me it smells like ancient old lady cheap perfume, Using the No-poo ""shampoo"" and conditioner makes the smell worse.
"
"
I bought this deva curl cream after seeing all the youtube reviews.  I have wavy frizzy hair. At first it feels good. But after the hair is completely dried up , it feels too scrunchy. Also the hold goes away in less than an hour. Expensive and doesn't do the job. I have switched recently to another brand .
"
"
This styling cream is amazing! I was excited when Deva Concepts released this product but was put off by the price relative to the amount of product you get. In the past I have had to be fairly heavy handed with curl creams to get good results so I was certain I would go through a 5 oz. bottle of this in a week. I finally got a chance to try the cream this week because I received a sample. I was (am) blown away. A little of this product goes a very long way. I was able to get two applications for my long, medium density, 3c hair with enough left over for one application for my mother who has medium length fine 4a hair. Here are the pros and cons of this cream:Pros:- Very concentrated; you only need a very small amount to get optimal results.- Leaves hair very soft but has good hold. The first two days I used this (first and second day hair) were very windy. My curls looked fantastic at the end of each day and i was out and about quite a bit.- Imparts a nice shine.- Very moisturizing but does not weigh down the hair. I had great volume on both my first and second day hair.Cons:- The price. While it is a better value if you think of it interms of cost per use (rather than cost per once) since you don't need to use very much, I still think it is slightly overpriced. It is about $7.00 more than their styling gels and while most people will need to use a bit more gel to get similar results as this cream I don't think it quite balances out.
"
"
I love DevaCurl. BUT this product is not for me. I bought it with high hopes and was disappointed. I have a lot of hair and is thick 3b/3c curls. The first time I  used it, it has left my hair weight down and stiff. It did not define my curl. So, I decided to give it a second try just in case I was the one seeing things. The second time I used it, same result. And my family and friends noticed! They told me me hair did not look as curly and that it looked stiff and weigh down. Bummer! And I have 2 bottles. What works wonderful for me after getting out of the shower is applying Ouidads ""Moisture Lock Leave in Conditioner"" then spraying Deva Curls ""Set it Free moisture lock"" spray. Results: Amazing Curls!
"
"
I did not buy this from Amazon but I want you to know how happy I am with the product. I have short very wavy/curly hair and it works great. Scrunch it in on wet hair and avoid the hair brush. I air dry most days but in a pinch I'll use the hair dryer with a diffuser. My hair is usually hit or miss after drying but 4 days in a row I am happy. I just use a dime size dab.
"
"
I ordered the trial set and I am hooked on this styling cream. I am African American with 3c/4a hair type- I basically have corkscrew curls. I use this styling cream along with the light defining gel and my curls are super defined and soft. My wash and go's are taken to the next level with these products. I have no frizz all day, I loosely pineapple my hair at night and when I get up, I literally shake and go. The curls are still super defined after a day. I am planning to purchase the more of the styling cream and gel very soon!!
"
"
I've only used it for one day but I already love how my fine & dry hair is way less frizzy than usual. And that's without a crunchy look. I like how soft it feels.
"
"
After 30 years of fighting my curly hair with everything from up dos to relaxers as well as Brazilian and Japanese straitening at the salon, I finally enjoy having curls.My hair dresser first introduced me to this product.  She specializes in curly hair cuts and uses dry hair cuts for curls ( you can find a dry cut specialist in you area by googling ""natural curly website"" and using the ""find a local salon"" tab. For my, slightly past shoulder length, hair I was told to use 2 pumps . I then follow with Devacurl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam to give my curls some extra hold. Between those two products I would say the styling cream is the miracle I've been looking for.
"
"
I used a couple other products in the Deva Curl line years ago, before they reformulated... I remember liking No Poo and One Conditioner, but I bought, tried and returned every single other product from the line at Ulta.  I got my hair cut by a Devachan-trained stylist for the first time last week, and he used this cream on my hair, giving amazing results... even overnight!  So, I bought it.  I have had fabulous (3B) curls the past few years using Kinky Curly Curling Custard and a cheap gel (Herbal Essences Set Me Up), but it rarely looks good enough to leave the house as 2nd-day-hair.  With this Deva cream, I can actually go three days and look good... I can run my fingers through my hair and no frizz, just voluminous, clumpy curls... what?!  LOVE IT.
"
"
love this cream. works great for my  naturaly curly hair. The no poo and the conditioner on the other hand i did not like and actually made my hair frizzer and puffier (not what we curly heads want.) but I did love the styling cream. Make my hair soft and help give my curls great definition.
"
"
Tried a sample of this for 2 days (provided by another company). Scrunched it into my wet hair and let it air dry. I loved how it didn't make my hair crunchy like other products can, nor did my hair look like it was wet all day long. My waves were full and soft. HOWEVER, I couldn't handle the overpowering scent. It was so strong I felt I could taste it. I had to toss the remainder of the sample. I won't use it again.
"
"
This product is a must-have in my bathroom cabinet. I can't live without it. After showering and towel drying my hair, I put 1-2 pumps in my hands and scrunch it through my hair. It leaves my hair soft, frizz-free and my wavy/curly hair looks beautiful. I can't find a product like this one. No comparison!
"
"
I love this product in addition to the One Condition. I recently got a deva cut and when my hair was styled it looked the best that it has ever been!!!! I went ahead and purchased the products for home use. I'm on second day hair and it still looks amazing but now it's starting to get more volume. My hair is well tamed and smells amazing too. My curls are perfectly defined and so soft. I have a mixture of 3c and 4a hair.
"
"
I heard so many  wonderful things about this line of products  that I decided to give it a try to this cream and gel.  It’s AWFUL for my hair and it left it dull and dry. Also items  are non refundable.
"
"
I've been fighting my coarse, curly hair for decades. Every once in awhile I'll find something I like, and then it's discontinued. More often though, it just stops working like I expect. Is it because companies reformulate? That is always possible. It's also possible that the hair I had in my teens, 20's, and 30's isn't the same from decade to decade and I have to live with that.Currently I have it color treated a dark color, and am growing it out. Kind of like the Mary Louise Parker look (only not with short shorts). I have a good hair day if I leave it curly, maybe once a month. It's so frustrating. I can't seem to find advice for my certain hair, from anyone who HAS this kind of hair. Even the Folica forums are filled with people much younger than myself, with time to mess with their hair endlessly. That's not me. I just need something to put on it and use minimum effort, to ENHANCE and CONTROL what I have.One day I was in an Ulta whose manager treats me like I have a communicable disease and shoplift; praying that the first person to offer help would not be her. At any rate, when I was once again looking for a curly-hair product, I went in that day with not so great hair. You would think this would be the perfect time for someone to see just what they need to work with and make a good recommendation! So here comes MisManager, looking all over at my purse, hands, etc. as she asks me if she can help me? I told her what I need, and she started pointing out products that weren't even appropriate. (She has very very thin, fine hair made bone white, black, and pink, and plastered to her skull....so she showed me products that would work for her). Finally we came to the Deva Curl section and she said, ""They have great shampoo!"" But I'm not looking for shampoo, I need a STYLING CREAM. She pulled out their gel, ""This is great gel!"" (BANG HEAD) Finally I found the styling cream. She chirped happily, ""Oh that's great cream!"" I told her it was hard to find stuff that worked, and she said: (brace for it) ""Well it can't look any worse than it does now!""Her customer service skills were so impressive, that I bought it on the spot. Actually I knew if I did not like it, I could return it (which I expected).There are a lot of nice things about the Deva Curl and you may not discover them until you play with it awhile. There are many ways to use it. Let me caution you about using it as a final touch up on dry or mostly dry hair: you may look like you didn't wash your hair recently. (Use VERY sparingly) Also, if you don't distribute it well enough, you get white dried lumps in your hair. If you work around anyone who has a juvenile mindset, expect to hear about the white things in your hair.I like to put in one squirt (my hair is past shoulder length) and use it as a blowdry cream until my hair is about 3/4 dry, and then squish in another squirt into the ends and shafts, scrunch it in, and let it air dry, for lots of curls. You can do some finger spirals and such to shape them how you want.I also like to put in two squirts and distribute that, and blowdry my hair until finished (with some Milk Shake serum also) with my hands (no brushes, just fingers). the Deva Curl makes the hair smooth and shiny, it's not STRAIGHT But there is just enough shine and definition and wave to look like you didn't even do your hair. (When we all know that if I didn't 'do' my hair I would look like Krusty the Clown)I'm on my second bottle of the Deva Curl, and the price on Amazon is way less than Ulta. So instead of $26 and Cruella DeVille, I can order this for less from the comfort of my home, sitting with my ""couldn't be worse"" hair :--) With use several times a week, I got about 3 months out of this bottle. Realistically, I probably get closer to 2 months now that I'm learning how to work with it more.UPDATE: I put this (one squirt) into my hair and used it as a setting lotion with big rollers...can you believe it works??? Very smooth results.
"
"
I got this as a sample and figured maybe it would help my fine, barely wavy hair get a little oomph. That's exactly what it did. It's helped my hair hang on to the little bit of wave that it has, made it hold up a little better through the day. So though I'm no curly-head, I'm a convert.
"
"
Great product.  Delivery as promised.
"
"
I have been trying product after product to get my fine hair to behave.  Most products are too oily or too heavy resulting in a disaster on my head.  This works great! Keeps the curls together, no frizz, shiny, and looks great
"
"
Love this product! My curls are soft & holds all day.
"
"
I have naturally wavy/kinky hair and this stuff give me corkscrew curls.  I use with the the ""No Poo"" and conditioning cream - my curls have never looked this good.  LOVE this product!!!!
"
"
I am so impressed with this deva curl cream! I also got the No poo (shampoo) and conditioner! I will be buying more! This has changed my hair! And my 2 year old Daughters hair!! She has ringlets! Her hair went from white girl Afro to perfect ringlets!!! I'm forever sold on this hair care line.

I have been processing my hair using Japanese straightening techniques for over ten years. However, since I got pregnant a year back I couldn't do any chemical treatment and was left to embrace my unruly curls again. I usually blow dry my hair straight. But since we had plans of going to Hawaii and knowing the humidity factor I was dreading my trip. After some research I came across devacurls and thought of give it a try. Please make note that I have never used any other curling products other than Devacurls. I ended up not going to Hawaii and instead visited India for a family emergency. It wasn't humid this time of the year but I didn't have the luxury to blow dry my hair and straighten every time I washed my hair.So here's my feedback :Pros:It doesn't feel too strong or stickySeems less damaging to my hair ( ha - I chemical treated my hair for ten years)Looks really good when it is first appliedCons:Tends to lose the hold after a couple of hours(Maybe because I have a ton of hair)I intend to combine the product with the gel like another reviewer suggestd
"
"
I love this product I have very curly hair and when I want something simple and don’t want to blow dry I just put this in and let it natural dry. Big bouncy curls and little to now frizz.
"
"
I put 4 stars because I’m just not sure yet if my 2a/2b, fine, and extremely porous hair loves this or not.It seems to weigh it down, but it’s so moisturizing and gives a perfectly gentle cast. My hair hates most gels, i cannot scrunch out the crunch no matter how hard I try!My MIL on the other hand, has 2c/3a hair and LOVES it. It tames her wild frizz and gives great definition while keeping it soft.
"
"
Provides a great level of control to my thick, curly hair. I've put this in while my hair is damp and it locks in plenty of moisture while not giving that greasy feeling you get from some stylers. I've also had success using this on my hair when it's dry so this is a very versatile product. My hair is a foot in length, maybe a bit longer, at the time of writing this review and I find about 2 pumps of this product is enough to give me the result I'm looking for.Another great thing about this product is the smell. It smells like Skittles! Love it, hah!
"
"
I use this product after every wash or rather every condition, with the One condition conditioner. Four pumps of the gel and 2 1/2 of this cream on medium length, average thickness hair. I let it dry about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way and then dry with a diffuser while scrunching the curls. turns out perfect every time. I also never comb or brush my hair but use my fingers to detangle with conditioner in the shower. I agree that the smell is not good! like skittles and who wants to smell like that? Mixed with the scents of the other products it seems to tone it down and when dry not so bad but I wish I could have perfect hair without the smell of skittles.
"
"
I have tested a variety of curly hair products, the good and the bad. After trying this one i would rate it somewhere in the middle. It defines curls and minimizes frizz, but i felt like it left my hair with a greasy texture that was hard to get out. It's also really easy for it to clump in one place in your hair if you're not careful because it has such a thick consistency. For the price, i'd rather get something else. If it was cheaper i would use this regularly though.
"
"
FANTASTIC product!  I have fine, curly hair and this product is IT.  It's a great way to add body to hair without making it sticky or crunchy.  I  highly recommend this to all with Curls.  Cheers!
"
"
I have thick curly hair. The product defines my curls without making them greasy or crunchy. It works better for me that Devacurl gel. I can use this creme without other Devacurl products (shampoo and conditioner) and still get great results. It is very important to apply the cream to soaking wet hair and to scrunch your hair, not rake it.
"
"
Every time I order the one the left side on the picture I get the the other one on the right side, I know both deva cream but I felt different result, I'm not sure are both the same or not ??! Any help
"
"
I have fine, grey, wavy hair and this product works amazingly well to give me beautiful spiral curls but I have to put it on while my hair is soaking wet.  I rub a pea size amount between my palms and gently squish it into my ends first and work toward the roots.  Then I wrap my hair loosely in a old tee shirt.  Leave it for about an hour then remove tee and let dry.  My hair has never looked better.
"
"
I tried DevaCurl because of the reviews.  Unfortunately it didn't work on my hair, it just made it a frizzy, crunchy mess.  I used the whole bottle, thinking my hair needed time to adjust, but it didn't get better.  I do not this is a good value for the price as I need to use more product due to the length and thickness of my hair.  Not worth it to give it another try.
"
"
I’ve been using this product for about 2 years now and it’s works well with my lightweight curly hair without making it look greasy or weighted down. I noticed with this last bottle the scent has changed somewhat. Not bad, just different. Other than that it is consistently well made and a good product to have curly without frizzy hair.
"
"
I love this stuff!!!! Will definitely order again!!!
"
"
This product has caused my hair to fall out in clumps.  I don't dye my hair, haven't changed my diet and since discontinuing use a few days ago, my hair has stopped falling out in clumps.  I do not recommend this product.  It should be recalled.  Do some research on the web and you will see that many users are having issues and there are lawsuits against the company.

Best leave in styling product I've ever used and i tried plenty. It's gentle and doesn't crunch your hair, but if you have extra frizzy hair like mine, i would use it in combination with other products since it's not meant to give you a strong hold. But it's a great substitute for leave in conditioner.
"
"
I absolutely love this product!I have been trying to find an alternative of hair products for my curly damaged hair, and this one particularly is one that I plan to keep buying! It's amazing! The downside is that in order for me to achieve the curls I want I have to use A LOT of product, and the product itself is a but expensive, but still I love it!
"
"
If I could give no stars I would!! This product is horrible and it did nothing for my curls. I applied it exactly how it said to but all it did was make my hair, neck and face feel sticky and not soft to touch!  My hair ended up looking like a poof ball afterwards once my hair completely dried!  Then it said I couldn’t return it!
"
"
I love this product. I could feel the hydration in my curly hair from the first application. I put it on damp hair and seal it in with a little melted coconut oil. Soft shiny curls and less shedding.
"
"
Great product but the way its packaged will create problems because the cap pops off and it explodes in the package. Its happened twice now. Better to find it in a store.
"
"
Love this product!  I feel like I have tried EVERYTHING for my hair and I have actually had a lot of good hair days with this styling cream.  I tend to mix it with Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Envy Perfect Curl Cream, 6 oz and my hair looks fantastic!  Soft curls, not crunchy like some products and not too frizzy either.  I would definitely recommend this!
"
"
DevaCurl hair products SAVED my hair! I recommend anyone with any type of curl in their hair to use all of the DevaCurl products. They transform your curls beautiful and in a very short period of time! You can never go wrong with DevaCurl.
"
"
I've tried just about every product for curly hair out there, so I was skeptical, but this does seem to work--helps shape curls and keeps them soft. If I used it repeatedly between washes, however, I found it made my hair clumpy/stringy. Everyone says it smells like Skittles--I thought it smelled good!
"
"
I have tried several different Deva Curl products - no poo, one condition, light and ultra hold gel, frizz free volumizing foam, set it free - and this is now my favorite. The cream gives you a lighter hold than the gel, and I haven't noticed any buildup or white flaky residue that I saw when I tried either of the gels. A little amount also goes a long way, so this bottle lasted me much longer than I expected it would.
"
"
I actually love this product so much. My hair isn't crunchy or heavy when I use it. It maintains its curl, is so bouncy and just so, so lovely. Second day hair doesn't even need to be re-wetted (WHAT?! Yea, you read that correctly). You just tweak it a bit, shake it out, and it looks amazing, if tied up correctly the night before. I'm one to resist the bandwagon for as long as humanly possible but consider me converted to the devacurl cult.
"
"
This is the best product for my curls. It keep my curls tamed and shaped but without any stickiness or extra weight. I have tried many products and have found this one to work the best for me. I thought the scent was nice as well. I have thick long hair and can say its my favorite product for sure!
"
"
I am in the process of trying to find the right product for my type 3a curly hair and had high hopes for this line.  For me, this cream just did not provide enough hold.  I tried a second day using double the product, basically 6 pumps, and while it help my curl hold longer, it did make it feel sticky.  I say try and get a sample size if possible before investing too much.  Another plus is the scent is very nice and clean.  I really wanted to like this line!
"
"
I really like this line of hair care. I’ve tried almost all of the different products and this one did not disappoint. It provides hold without stiffness.
"
"
Used this the second day -- I had used their Ultra Defining Gel first (on damp hair) and it made it all too stiff. The next morning I tried a small amount of this creme and I like it a lot....softened the curl....helped it to last. I don't like to wash my hair too often -- curly hair can become too dry ...so next time I may just use this creme instead of the Ultra Defining Gel. In any case I liked it....definitely kept my hair from getting frizzy too.
"
"
My daughter recently transitioned back to her naturally curly hair after years of straightening it.  The one thing that bothered her the most is how short her hair is when curly.  We have tried so many products but this product is the winner of all of the styling creams.  It elongates her curls while keeping them intact.  She is so happy when we use this, this is now the only product for us.  Great price too!
"
"
I have always fought having curly hair because I didn’t know how to make it look not frizzy. I have tried everything! My hairstylist suggested this because her son has curly hair. This product defines your curls with no frizz PLUS when I style it straight it’s amazing too!!!
"
"
No matter how much I used my hair always felt greasy and the curls went straight half way through the day from being weighed down. The smell is okay. I didn't care for it though, almost like candy or something.
"
"
I've got big loose curls, that will quickly turn into Roseanne Roseannadanna hair if I touch it too much or don't use enough product.  I gave up flat ironing about a year and a half ago, and started using Deva Curl products in hopes of reclaiming 7 hours a week, and losing the frizz at the slightest sign of humidity.  I've gone through at least 3 large bottles of the gel (light and firm) and liked the look- but wasn't thrilled with it.  My hair would feel rough (I don't know how else to describe it) and still looked pretty frizzy on days that weren't perfect.  It takes about 8 pumps of the gel for my thick shoulder length hair.  I started using this Styling cream a couple months ago.  I feel like it makes my hair look like I want it to.  There is more shine- and it's softer.  It takes about 2 pumps for my whole head.  It doesn't create the gel cast- it just dries with a nice sheen and defined curls.  I will also use it between washes.  Just a spritz with water and maybe half a pump for the ends of my curls does the trick.  I read some reviews saying this was too heavy for their hair.  My hair is thick and coarse so it easily supports the heaviness of the cream, but I can see if you used very much it would be too much- or if you had thin hair, or tenuous curls it is probably not the product for you.  But for me... I love it!
"
"
This is a great product and has made my 3A curls awesome. A little bit goes a long way or it will get sticky and greasy. Start with a little bit and add more as needed. I usually follow up with the Living Proof Humidity Shield spray as a finishing touch.I did notice after I started using this that I had a few breakouts around my forehead and hairline. Not sure if it was the change in product or not. They have cleared up but we will see if they come back.
"
"
I am so happy Deva came out with this line. I love the fact that this styling cream, which also seems to work as a leave in conditioner, has coconut oil. This has really cut down on the time I spend styling my hair. Great price and speedy delivery from this vendor.
"
"
Ive been using this  now for 2 years. It smells really nice--nothing overpowering and make nice curls without the crunch of mousse.
"
"
Seems to be doing a good job of soft hold on my 2b,2c curls/waves. Only complaint is you really really don't need a lot and the pump mechanism generally dispenses too much. You will have to actively remind yourself every time that you have to go easy and only give it a half pump.
"
"
Love this product our hair soaks in the moisture. Both my daughter & Use this and we both have completely different textures of hair.
"
"
I've been using this product for weeks now. I have naturally curly hair and when my sister the hair stylist recommended it to me I was excited about finally have beautiful curls...I was disappointed. My hair is still frizzing up and it doesn't define my curls well. I love how it smells but for 20 bucks I expected more. I recently purchased their ultra defining gel and their shampoo and conditioner. I plan to give those products a try and I am hopeful they will work better for me
"
"
Product delivered in bubble wrap. When I opened the wrap product was split in two!
"
"
I really liked the way my curls looked with this product. But it has a heavy feeling on the curls, and the next day it made my hair tangly and had to wash it out, which I don’t like to wash it daily. Almost like a greasy film on the hair.
"
"
The top of my head seems to be the part that needs a more substantial product.  I tend to use this all over my hair then add some of the gel to the part that needs more structure.  This gives pretty good soft curls w/o the crunch of gel.
"
"
I've tried so many other products, b/c i hate paying this price, but nothing has been even close. Hands down the best product i've used. It doesnt even feel like there's product in my hair and creates soft beach waves, instead of crunchy curls.
"
"
LOVE this product. Hard to find where I live so being able to order here is great. And product arrived quickly
"
"
I like to use this on soaked hair then towel dry with a t shirt  just enough to not soak your fresh clothes. Let air dry and do not touch! Awesome definition.
"
"
It smells delicious. That's the only reason why I chose this over other products. It helps with my curl. I only use it after shower when my hair is wet because I don't like the greasy look. I take one pump and rub it against my hand until it's WELL spread and comb across my hair using my fingers. Then it keeps your hair soft. It helps to create the look after the you walk out the hair salon.
"
"
I have a lot of thick curls and I didn't find this product to do much other than moisten them. I had hoped it would rejuvinate the curl so I wouldn't have to re wet them every time but this product, at least for me didn't do that. However I gave 3 stars because my friend likes it and it seems to works well for her curls which are thinner.
"
"
This stuff is amazing for naturally curly hair. Keeps the humidity out all day
"
"
Ordered this for my daughter. She has very thick, coarse curly red hair. She went from many years of hating her hair to loving it. All the deva curl products are amazing. Amazon has the best prices. I know some of the products seem a bit pricey but so worth it. They really do last a long time
"
"
Love DevaCurl and it is cheaper here than in the shops.
"
"
I did not use this product personally, but bought it for my teenage daughter who has long, thick, curly hair. She is always looking for a product that will keep her curls in nice shape and prevent frizz, and this was recommended to her by her curly-haired cousin. She LOVES it. Best product she has found to keep her curls beautiful and frizz-free, and I am now under strict orders to buy it anytime I manage to find it on sale.
"
"
I have tried many many different curly hair products and this the best I've found. I wish the smell wasn't as strong but it works well.
"
"
This is my favorite hairstyle cream and it smells great. It's not always easy taming my curly hair but this one works!!!
"
"
I usually by this at Ulta or Target and added it to my amazon order for convenience since I was running out. The bottle I got smells completely different than the current bottle I’m using that was purchased at utta. This version smells like very strong cheap candy. Like Pez or something. Unfortunately I can’t return it so it’s a loss.
"
"
I have naturally wavy hair that is prone to frizziness in humid weather.This product seems to tame this. It smells great and leaves no sticky residue .Love it
"
"
I stand by this product. Love the smell easy to use and it makes my hair look amazing
"
"
I have very curly hair and swim regularly, so this product has been a lifesaver because it hidrates my hair and shapes my curls nicely. My son, with wavy hair likes it too, and it really defines his curls!
"
"
This curl cream is a miracle worker for curly hair.  Whether i put it on my wet hair and diffuse dry, or use before curling my hair to bump up the curl.  It's the softest product I've ever used that helps to lock out frizz and hold the curl.  No crunch, no tough texture, just beautiful curls.
"
"
The scent was so strong...and it seemed to be a lingering chemical perfume scent...that I couldn’t stand to use it.
"
"
This product is fantastic. I started using it after receiving a free sample packet somewhere, and I'm never switching back. Previously, I used the Devacurl gel with the volumizing foam. This gives me more definition to my curls and they seem to last longer between washing. I definitely recommend this (and the entire DevaCurl line) to people with curly hair.
"
"
Everyone raves about this for girls with curly hair but I have fine, sparse, frizzy, and curly/wavy hair. It kinda does nothing to my hair except weigh it down. I really expected more after hearing about everyone talk about this like it was a lifesaver. For me personally, it did nothing for my hair type. I would not buy this product again but if you have suggestions for products to use in my hair type, I am open to a conversation.
"
"
My stylist recommended I purchase the various DevaCurl products and I'm very glad I did! This is great if you have kinky curls. My curls start out as beautiful ringlets but start to fall after a couple of days. Now I just wet it a bit and put this styling cream in and voila! Reshaped! It also smells great and is cruelty free.
"
"
Good product
"
"
It's definitely Deva Curl quality, but I'm not sure yet if it's right for my hair. I have ultra fine hair. It's so finethat even experienced hair dressers have trouble working with it.  Also, the climate I live in is usually humid.I used low poo, then one conditioner, and believe in, and then the styling cream. It may be that I need to useit in a different way than I did last time.  My hair pulled into nice spirals, but...it was so ridiculously soft that itsoon was stringy and limp.  Maybe if I didn't use the one conditioner it would have worked better. Just notsure yet.Since my last review, I tried this product again.  Still no success with it.  My hair is so very fine, so I tried using a nonsulfate shampoo other than my regular low poo by Deva. The Deva products all have a lot of glycerin, which for finehair will weigh it down.  Also, I did not use any conditioner at all. I then applied a few pumps of believe in,  4 pumps of thethe curling cream, and  a few pumps of the gel.  The curling cream has a lot of  glycerin.My hair was limp from it. It was way too soft. I have used the curling cream on day two when I don't want to wash.It worked well for that. I just think its not going to work for my fine hair. I really like deva curl products, but they aren'tfriendly to baby fine hair.
"
"
Love this cream. I have 3b curls and it leaves my hair very moisturized and truly defined. This should my favorite styling product. It's the numerous styling product I would bring to any vacation
"
"
I have only used this product once and it is already the best curl cream i have ever touched. I used to only use Aveda ""Be Curly"" but it is absurdly expensive and difficult to find outside of an Aveda retailer. This stuff is heaven sent. Springiest curls EVER
"
"
The first time I tried this product, I hated it. But then I went to a Deva certified stylist who not only gave me a fantastic haircut but showed me the right way to use all the Deva products to get the best results. My hair is very, very dry and very curly. I have ALWAYS wrapped my hair in towel after showering and then put styling products in after it was just a tad dry. WRONG. For my hair, my stylist told me to finish in the shower but apply the products while my hair is sopping wet IN the shower. So, I flip my hair forward and apply a few pumps of the Deva Curl B'Leave In. It's called a ""Curl Booster and Volumizer"" which scared me, but I use it as a leave in moisturizer. I apply it by scrunching it into my hair, trying not to separate the strand of curls. Then I use THIS product, the Styling Cream. Same way, in the shower after B'Leave In on very wet hair. I use 2 pumps of this and it's plenty. Then, I gently dab at my hair until it's not dripping, which doesn't take long. I do not wrap it in a towel anymore (I was told it disrupts the curls too much and I think that's true!). I honestly cannot believe the difference it's made in my curls. I never have crunchy curls. My curls are soft and shiny. Once in a while, I use the Set It Free spray - on those super humid days mostly.If you have curly hair and are constantly questing for new products, I highly recommend finding a Deva trained stylist in your area and going in at least once for the stylist to recommend products and how to use them best for your hair. My daughter has curly hair too and uses completely different Deva products. Once you know what and how to use them, you'll be a fan.
"
"
The scent can be overwhelming, but the product is fantastic
"
"
Love this stuff. It makes my waves soft and bouncy. Easy to use on wet or dry hair.
"

I had a gift certificate from Christmas and really needed some new hair products.  I bought this, the conditioner to it, and the curl holding creme.I have very processed hair.  I dye it regularly and high heat wave, curl, or straighten depending on my mood.  It's shoulder length or more and somewhat thick.The shampoo does not lather.  It's not supposed to.  It's cleansing your hair.  If I didn't know this ahead of time, I'd  probably have freaked out and sent it back.  You work it through your hair and rinse.  I usually do this twice.  I don't care for the smell, but it doesn't matter because the conditioner smells great.  You work the conditioner through and leave it on as long as you need it.  A minute or ten, doesn't matter, it just depends on how deep you want or need your conditioning.  You can rinse it and then towel dry your hair and put a bit back in to stay.  It makes your hair soft and gives more hold, but I thought doing that made my hair feel heavy, but I did try it.  The creme hold stuff smells great too.  The hold is ""OK"".  That's why the 4 stars and not 5.  I'm reviewing the 3 products as a whole system overall.  The creme smells good, feels good, and I even rubbed my hands on my face after running it through my hair.  It made such a good lotion.  I found that my curls needed the occasional touch up if I were going out, or had something going on in the evening.  I didn't need to add more, just needed to touch up my hair a bit.This stuff blows your average department store products away.  I like biolage better, but can't afford it.  But this is better than then the Nexxus products.  The shipping was quick with Prime and on time.  Packaging was fine.  Bottle is simple, plain, not gimicky, if you know what I mean.  I would buy more, try some other of their products, and recommend this product.
"
"
Great product , very happy with the purchase. Wish I would have ordered it when my hair was longer. Well better late than never? My hair looks great. Use it in conjunction with the devacurl styling cream for best results.
"
"
Gave this product away because it was too greasy for me
"
"
BEST Curly Hair Product on the market by far!  I have tried everything, and nothing ever worked.  So happy to have finally found a product that works wonders for my curly hair.  I highly suggest the No-Poo and Conditioner as well.  My hair type is natural curly, mix of corkscrews and waves, thin hair, but lots of it!
"
"
I was really kind of shocked at how well this product (in conjunction with the light-hold gel) defined my curls. My hair was so soft immediately after use, and stayed that way for the week I left them in! AND it smelled awesome. Cool beans. Most natural products don't do that all of that.
"
"
Nothing - absolutely nothing - holds my curls as well as this.  DevaCurl is the bomb!  Especially since my curls are so flat at times after a long while of straightening my hair every day.  The best part is the smell - it's very lovely.  You don't  need much to get a lot of results.
"
"
This is the most wonderful curl cream I have used. It's pricey considering how much you get, but a little goes a long way. I have thick, wavy, curly, frizzy hair and this not only tames the beast but smells divine! Literally a few pumps worked into WET hair is all you need.
"
"
It's a cream as it says. Smell is okay, kinda strong. What I don't like about it is how greasy it makes my hair by itself. I normally use it with the b'leave in conditioner and the ultra defining gel. That combo works well most of the time. Probably won't buy again.
"
"
I have just finished my first canister of this styling cream. It works wonders on my hair! I am a 3b (with 3c tendencies) / multicultural corkscrew. I use this cream in conjunction with the Deva Curl Angell. I find that if I just use the gel alone, my hair becomes dry and frizzy. The cream makes my curls soft and beautiful. I also use it when I don't have time to wash my hair. A pump of this cream, shake my curls out a bit, and I'm ready for any type of weather! It's great. I would recommend anyone to try it.
"
"
Don't feel like this product moisturizes my hair and I recently learned that DevaCurl could potentially be damaging people's hair and scalp
"
"
Excellent control without being sticky or hard.  My go to styling cream.
"
"
Came broken!
"
"
My husband isn't a hair guy, but this is the only hair product my husband has ever used... he has curls and it helps him keep it under control. My hair stylist recommended it to him after he went to her for an emergency haircut.
"
"
I've been using this cream over a year now and I still love it. My hair is soft and not crunchy. It doesn't weigh down my hair either.
"
"
I've known about devacurl for years and I've never gotten around to trying. Absolutely dumbest thing I've ever done in regards to my hair. I've been struggling trying to make all these natural or curly haired products work ( Shea, carols daughter, miss Jessie's) but I couldn't seem to find the right fit. The problem is is that my hair isn't a great fan of oils or butters, and all these products are chalk full of them. I kept trying to force  my hair to like them, because it's all natural and blah blah. I kept hoping and praying everytime I slathered some new product on that this time my hair wouldn't feel weighed down, tangled, wiry and greasy. Finally I found something that works. This is so light weight ( and I out a ton in my hair) but it never left my hair feeling bunked up like those Shea products did. Even befor my hair dried I could tell I would see great results. Nice slip to it. Easy to apply. Has a slight medicinal smell but it doesn't bother me. I paired this with the gel and air dried and achieved fabulous frizz free voluminous curls. I have 3c hair and would recommend anyone with curly hair (especially people who cannot use heavy products) to try this. Worth every penny
"
"
great for your hair leaves it soft and shiny
"
"
Perfect for my kiddo (and me). I didn't want to put too much hard gel in her hair, and the DevaCurl Styling Cream is just right. It has a great smell and a lighter, smoother hold. If I leave some conditioner in her long curly hair and finish with the styling cream, my daughter's hair looks great.
"
"
This is perfect for days where my curls are not cooperating.  If i use this at bedtime when my hair is still damp, my curls are super defined in the morning.  It's an nice little fix.
"
"
I am fully a Deva Curl convert. I like using this before the gel to help squish some extra hydration in before sealing it up to set for the day. Just bought another last night at a Deva Curl event.
"
"
Makes my natural curls nice and defined.  It smells nice too.
"
"
Feels amazing on my hair, soft hold.
"
"
I love this product.  It shapes my curls without giving them the always wet look that mouse gives them.  They stay soft and pliable and hold all day!
"
"
It takes only a small bit to add curls, thicker & shiny hair.
"
"
I personally do not use this product, but my wife does. She has very curly hair and this is the only styling cream she uses. PERIOD!
"
"
This stuff turns my frizzy mess into ringlets IF I put some coconut oil on first. I use it on wet hair. My hair is very dry so I need the coconut oil to moisturize. If I try to go without, the styling cream doesn't work as well.
"
"
It's OK, but not nearly as good as the Coconut Curl Styler by DevaCurl.
"
"
My wife loves this product.
"
"
Works well for my naturally curly hair, bought two times already and will definitely buy again.
"
"
I have brown curly Caucasian hair, but it's not very thick or textured. This gives the right amount of definition without being either oily or crunchy, and it perks up the second (or even third) day with a little spritzer to bring curl back. I will buy another bottle when this runs out.
"
"
It came faster than we were told. It came before she left for camp.  My granddaughter loves this product. She has very curly hair and her Hair looks beautiful after she uses this product
"
"
Great!
"
"
This stuff is awesome! if you mix it together with heaven in hair conditioner by devacurl while you are in the shower (AKA hair soaking wet after washing it) it works wonders, with no gel needed, and beautiful defined curls (even more than with the gel!)
"
"
Perfect for curly frizzy hair!  I straightened my hair for years until I found this product.
"
"
DevaCurl is the only product I will put on my natural curly hair, and my daughter's naturally curly hair.  Doesn't have all the bad stuff (sulfates and silicones) like other products made for curly hair and keeps hair healthy and strong.  My curls are defined and smells good too.  I love it!
"
"
DevaCurl has the absolute BEST products for curly hair!!!!!!!
"
"
Love my curls, not a lot product needed
"
"
Only just this was bigger. It keeps my curls lightweight and not stiff like moose does. It does get frizzy sometimes but curly hair is so unpredictable.
"
"
I LOVE this product but very disappointed with the packaging. Opened one part of the package and my hand was cover in the cream!!
"
"
Seems to help my daughter's curls, but her hair is so fine it seems to weigh it down a little.
"
"
Great product for my curly hair - no frizz!  I use with Deva No-Poo shampoo and conditioner.  This is a much better price than at the beauty product shops.
"
"
Not a fan of these products. Maybe I just don't have the right hair type to use them.
"
"
It smells like a cheap vanilla orange creamsicle.
"
"
Works well on my hair. Isn't too greasy or heavy.  Provides definition to my curls without being ""crunchy"" or wet looking.  However, I don't love the smell, which is too sweet for my taste.  I also use the DevaCurl Shampoo and Conditioner.
"
"
Calling all curly girls. I've been in a love-hate relationship with my curly hair for 54 years and I have tried sooooo many different products designed for curly hair.  Deva Curl (drama queen alert) seems to be the product I've been searching for!  And this leave-in conditioner is specifically the product I've always wanted to find.I use this before my gel and do the Deva scrunch-in-the-shower technique.  That's cool, but it's what this conditioner does for my dry hair that I really love.  Just back from the gym?  Scrunch some in.  Second, third, even fourth-day hair?  Scrunch some more in.  It gives me twirly springy curls. Yep, they're a bit stiff to feel, but they look great.I don't run my fingers through my hair any more and I only shampoo once or twice a week and my hair has never looked better, even in humid climates.  Yee haw!
"
"
Great product to tame those curls! It gave my wavy hair a curlier look and no frizz at all! Unlike mousse, this product leaves your curls soft and shiny. I will not go back to my mousse anymore.
"
"
Ugh. I'm so mad that I love this product so much. Before trying this product, I was in love with the OGX Curl Enhancing Yogurt (which they no longer make! :( ) I have tried several curl cream products and none were as good as the OGX one so when I came across this DevaCurl cream, I really didn't think I was going to like it more than my OGX cream, especially since it has such a steep price. I told myself that this cream would really have to be amazing for me to abandon the OGX cream and be willing to pay the higher price. And, unfortunately, it was amazing. First of all, I love the smell. Smell is a big deal for me because I find that the scents of curl creams really linger in my hair. This one smells a little bit lemony to me. Kinda like lemon cake or something. Secondly, it really transforms my curls. I've never used a curl cream that made my curls look so bouncy, voluminous, and defined. It's just crazy. It has a slight tackiness to it that I didn't think I was going to like at first, but I think that the tackiness is what allows the cream to hold a curl so well and for so long, so I don't really mind the tackiness anymore. Thirdly, a little goes a long way. A dime sized portion would work for my hair, which is saying a lot because I have a lot of hair. I always end up using more than that though because I love the way it smells! It's not the greatest product for moisturizing curls - the OGX curl cream does a better job of that - but it certainly gives SOME moisture to my hair. The greatest downside of this product is the price. I paid around $17, but I know that it can be as much as $25, which is really expensive for a hair product in my opinion. BUT, I do think it's worth the money - even the $25 price tag. It's so good. I was so blown away. It's worth every penny and I would highly recommend it!

This product really works!! Finally! For years I've been trying to find a styling product for my very curly hair & I've had no luck until now. It doesn't make my hair crunchy or frizzy. Those were my two biggest problems with all the styling products out there. You have to watch the utube video on how to use it correctly. Just google Lorraine Massey Devacurl products & she has utube videos on how to use her products. I will now wear my hair curly way more often than straight because this product really works.
"
"
I buy this for my daughter who has very curly hair. She loves it. You do have to use a lot for it to work but it does work.

I like this stuff. Not as much as Aveeno's shockingly discontinued Nourish Gel-creme tho. Seriously - still not over that and it was a good 3 years ago. I mean, that stuff smelled heavenly and was - as far as I'm concerned - the original 'heaven in hair'! (no offense Deva) Man, that product had a following and poof! Just gone one day. WTH?Anyway, after I'd finished the Aveeno stockpile I'd accumulated from re-sale discount stores, I could no longer deny that I had to find a new one creme because my 2B/2C fine curls just love them. I mix this Deva styling cream mostly with non-Deva light-weight, water-based gels and/or leave-in conditioners after co-washing. (Deva gels don't gel with my curls - go figure)For the price and the longevity I get out of the bottle based on a dime-size daily glob (not a full pump!), this was my second time purchasing it. As I said...I like this stuff.
"
"
If you have thick curly hair, this cream will be your best friend. It never looks ""wet"" and will just make your curls frizz free and soft.
"
"
Love this product- only need a little bit in my curly hair to help it keep a soft curl. I also recommend the gel- it is not crispy! Great line of products.
"
"
Love this styling cream! I started using it after getting a deva cut and it's amazing! I comb it through my wet hair and it leaves my curls perfect.
"
"
Love it for me permed hair- the whole line is awesome and has helped keep my perm nice for much longer than normal.
"
"
The best curling product in my opinion!
"
"
I love Deva Curl and use it every day for soft, bouncy curls!
"
"
This is a great hair moisturizer! Have never had a bad experience with any deva curl products!
"
"
I also love this curling cream, keeps the frizz at bay, especially in the summer. This is a Great Product!!!
"
"
Best styling cream for curly hair. I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun and I'm so glad I found this.
"
"
to keep my very dry course hair from frizzing. I add it to the Ang-gel and one conditioner and spread it thru my hair and it gives it a smooth polished look that lasts all day. Without it the hair starts frizzing within a few hour.
"
"
This is the best styling cream to define my waves that I have found in the past 25 years!
"
"
great product
"
"
I have thick coarse wavy, sometimes curly hair (think of coochie hair on the head).  This product isn't all it's cracked up to be. It didn't keep my hair from frizzing after it dried. Once it dries, it leaves this funky feel to your hair and forget capping or wrapping your hair, sleeping and waking with something manageable or pretty because I haven't. God forbid if you brush it. This product was recommended to me but it just wasn't a good fit. On the positive side, hence 2 stars, it smell wonderful,
"
"
Love this product.  Came fast and works as promised.
"
"
Works better on dry hair. Very moisturizing.
"
"
Looooooooooooove this product.  I like a softer hold than the deva curl gel, and this is perfect.  Keeps my hair soft and frizz free, but also locks in curl.  I'm a huge fan!
"
"
Exactly what I wanted!
"
"
It did not do much for my curls. They were soft, but it dragged them down. It did not pump them up. I will stick with Dove.
"
"
I love this product. We use it on my daughters hair. She has very curly fine hair. It works great and doesn't flake.
"
"
This leaves kind of a gritty feeling in my hair.
"
"
I have purchased DevaCurl Styling Cream for the past 7 years. I have barrel curls and love love love this product. I've tried many other products from the DevaCurl line, but this one is by far the best.
"
"
Good stuff
"
"
This product is a staple in my hair styling tool kit, and it has been for a while. My hair is thick, made up of fine hair strands, and it has a wavy-to-curly natural appearance that has to be coaxed either straight or curly. I apply this to my wet (partially dried, so that it's no longer dripping) hair, scrunch it, then go. This product doesn't make my hair feel sticky, stiff, or heavy, but it holds enough of that already existing curl so that I don't end up with straight frizz by the end of the day. Additionally, when using this product if I run my fingers through my hair it doesn't feel as though there's even product in my hair; it just feels natural. I recommend pairing it with the curl refreshing spray from the same line.
"
"
I love this product!!!
"
"
The product came on time and as described but it just didn't work for my hair. I was a little disappointed because I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but it didn't do what I wanted it to. My hair had no change, but my hair is particular. I plan on giving it to my sister.
"
"
Styles may hair well and leaves it soft and touchable
"
"
This works great
"
"
Second time ordering this item! Same product as profile picture and description!
"
"
I like this product for day 2 or 3. I still have to use something different the first day of washing hair but this product smooths out the frizzy the following day so everyday washing is no longer necessary!
"
"
great stuff. holds and shapes my curls. not sticky. the smell is not floral or overwhelming.
"
"
Like Ouidad better, do not like the Devaconcept scent, and for me, Ouidad works better, believe it or not, the best product for my hair has been Herbal Essence Mousse for scrunching. Of these three products, the mousse makes my hair curlier amd the least frizzy.  Go figure!
"
"
One of my favorite Deva products. I use it to help define a few curls on second and third day.
"
"
I've tried all kinds of curl products, and this one is by far the best!
"
"
great for curling hair
"
"
Doesn't work for my hair.  I am looking for a product that will enhance my natural curls and stop them becoming frizzy as the day goes on.  I will not order this again kind of pricey to not work.
"
"
Got curls, was hoping for better. I have tough nappy hair though,so..
"
"
This product turns my frizzy waves into actual curls with some body and tames the frizz. Washes out without residue. I love it!
"
"
I recently got a much needed cut and the stylist used this product as well as the low poo shampoo and one conditioner and I must say I love ALL of the products!The styling cream is light but holds my curl definition and aids against the frizzies.  LOVE!
"
"
Defines my curls and has become one of my favorite curl creams.
"
"
My hairdresser recommended it.
"
"
Great solution for very curly hair-keeps it relatively tame without the drying effects of gel.
"
"
I've been using this for months, and I love it. It's great for my frizzy hair.
"
"
My new favorite curly hair product. I haven't straightened my hair in about 3 months.
"
"
Smells great, tames frizz, love the pump. Works great, especially when using the Deva towel and shampoo. Overall a great line.
"
"
A little goes a long way.  I use two pumps for type 3a hair that is between hip and classic length.  It does a great job of bringing out the curl too.  I was skeptical at first, but this one is a keeper.
"
"
Good Product, but range is not too far.  About 12-15 feet.
"
"
Really liked the product. But I didn't feel like there was enough in the tube for the price.
"
"
The first thing you will notice is the great smell. The product isn't too heavy for fine hair. Keeps frizzies away and helps define curls.
"
"
My Go To Curl Enhancer! A
"
"
Nice hair cream. Doesn't leave a sticky feeling or crunchy, dry look. Soft curl alert!
"
"
Curls soft.  Small quantity for the price.
"
"
Arrived with broken top and product spilled in box. Not eligible for return. Bummer.
"
"
Great product for curly hair. Nice addition to your routine if you are looking for a cream that will be smooth and light.
"
"
Awesome product for curly hair. My husband uses it on his shoulder length hair and his curls last all day
"
"
Same as above. Excellent products
"
"
This seems to keep my hair softer than other product I have used. Love the smell.
"
"
This is a fantastic product to use by itself or in conjunction with other DevaCurl products!  Leaves my hair silky and full of bounce!
"
"
Works nicely
"
"
Makes my hair so soft, and I love the scent.  No complaints here.
"
"
really helps the curls come to life. you don't need to use a lot.
"
"
This really controls frizz.  For those oldsters out there: I went from Roseanne Rosannah Dannah to relatively normal looking hair.  My curls look and feel soft.  It smells nice too - not perfumy - just light and pleasant.  This MUST be used on wet hair and you have to have clean hands - no other products or lotions on them - for it to spread evenly.  The 2nd day you can tell that there is some product on your hair, but it's not like when you wet your hair that the water rolls off.I use this is in the summer and the gel in the winter.
"
"
Excellent product, thanks
"
"
Great product to control my curls
"
"
Use it for my hair and it is a working product. Do not overuse though it will stop doing the same affects to your hair. it is best applied wet and scrunch with blow dryer
"
"
Great Price!  We love this stuff
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE  all the Deva Curl products.  I won't put harsh chemicals on my curls anymore.  Well worth the money.
"
"
Works well on my hair. Holds it together & allows it to curl nicely.
"
"
I heard rave reviews from a friend about this product, so I purchased it expecting the same results. Unforturnately, I'm not a fan. I like the DevaCurl mousse but do not like the styling cream. It leaves your hair smelling wonderful, but also leaves an odd texture behind as well. I think it would be okay for one-day curls but if you try to do anything with it after that, it is greasy and hard to work with.
"
"
Like all Deva products for curly hair.
"
"
Exactly as described, fast shipping. Thanks!
"
"
We use all DevaCurl products for my 17 year old with ringlet curls. Her hair looks, feels and smells so goood - the styling cream and gel help to finish her style!
"
"
Love it.  No frizz,  no greasy feel. Nice scent.
"
"
Smells and feels amazing but doesn't hold my curls. I have to use a lot for it to actually work.
"
"
Works great in my son hair. He has very dry curly hair and it moisturizers it without making it greasy or heavy.
"
"
The smell is a little odd but curled my hair great !
"
"
Another Deva product that is wonderful on my hair...it made my curls better defined...i love it when everyone ask what have you done to your curls they are Sexier than ever... 😇😆
"
"
Great stuff. Not heavy or gummy. I have very curly hair and this takes the frizz out. Worth the money. You don't need much of this product, so it should last a very long time. I have a lot of hair,
"
"
I've used this product off and on for a few months now. Generally, it's OK. I received a sample of the Deva Curl super cream and I like that stuff a lot better because it's more moisturizing and curl defining. While this smells really nice, I haven't seen that it's done anything spectacular to my hair. Actually, it makes my hair feel a little more dry and rough, especially at the ends. I'm not super impressed with this product and will not repurchase.
"
"
Best price for those products!!!Love them, love the price!!
"
"
ALWAYS A GREAT PRODUCT
"
"
love the product......would not use anything else on my hair I have naturally curly hair and it locks the curls
"
"
Works GREAT for my hair.. curl definition, no frizz or crunchy hair. Love it!
"
"
Good transaction.  Product was as advertised.  Good price.
"
"
perfect- arrived on time!
"
"
I have always hated my curly hair but after I started using Davaconcepts DevaCurl Stying Cream, I love my curly hair!
"
"
Love this product.  It makes my curls come out perfect.
"
"
Just use a little on the tips of damp hair when it is dry or when your hair needs a little patting down.
"
"
I use all the DevaCurl products and I love them I use this between shampoos.
"
"
Works very well, just a bit sticky.
"
"
This non-toxic choice left my curls (shorter hair) stuck in place, though not stiff like with hair spray.  I was so disappointed.  I'll be looking for something else that gives me a oft curl that moves.
"
"
great product
"
"
This stuff smells like sour gummy worms and works great.
"
"
not what I was looking for.  Not the greatest smell.
"
"
Great for curls. Soft on your hair
"
"
Hold curls well. Adds nice definition, body, and reduces frizz.
"
"
Love this product. Keeps my hair soft.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
The best hair product I have ever used for my curly hair.
"
"
Deva Products work well in my mostly curly hair
"
"
Great Product
"
"
It smells strongly like Starburst, which is not terrible but not a smell taken from nature, like fruit or citrus or herbs or coconut or anything.  It also seems a little too thick and not as lightweight as I would prefer.
"
"
So, I have yet to use this product.I previously ordered morrocanoil curl defining cream and the smell was so strong and perfumey that I had to return it because it gave me a headache. I was told by many people that this product worked well and smelled great.I opened the bottle and I am IMPRESSED. IT SMELLS JUST LIKE SKITTLES. It smells so so good. If you don't like the smell of skittles, don't buy this. But if you do, you will love it.I will update once I use it. :) but based on smell this stuff is great, and it's highly recommended by most of the people I know.
"
"
Keeps my curls looking good and conditioned and not stiff.  It has a nice smell too.  My hair is permed and sometimes looks dry and frizzy.  This seems to keep it under control and does not make it look and feel stiff.  I am not fond of gel because it sometimes makes my hair look glued and sticky.  This makes my curls look natural and soft.  That is what I wanted from the product and that is what I am getting.  Overall I am pleased with DevaCurl products.
"
"
Exactly what I expected thank you!
"
"
i always knew i'd fall in love one day....just didn't realize it would be with a hair product. o.m.g. they hype is R.E.A.L.like all other curly girls-i've spent thousands of dollars & tried hundreds of products over the years-looking for that holy grail.FOUND IT!worth every.single.penny. LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!
"
"
I am giving this product a three star not because it is a bad product but because it doesn't quite do what it says it does. The name ""styling cream"" makes it seem as though this is a product to help with one's curls and many of the five star reviews also gave that impression. In my experience, it does not do this, and if you are looking for a product to do that, DevaCurl's Ultra Defining Gel is a much better product. The styling cream does not help define or hold curls and using it alone after showering left my hair frizzy. Now, as a leave-in conditioner, this is a decent, if expensive product. I can add it to my little ones' hair on days they don't shower and it helps add in some moisture, but it still doesn't work to tame the frizz or define their curls.Some reviews say this product smells like cotton candy, but I disagree. While I have found the Ultra Defining gel to have a decent scent, this does not.We will continue using this as a leave in conditioner for the kids since we paid $18 for it, but I won't be ordering this again.
"

Very nice styling cream for curly hair
"
"
This styling cream looked so promising. And, I tried. But, in the end, it was like trying to smile at someone's ugly baby, pretending that it's cute. Eventually, you can't keep up the fake grin any longer.Before this, I was using Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft. It works well, but when I saw that the tube was almost finished, I decided that I wanted to try something different, just for a change.DevaCurl works on my hair, but it doesn't work that well. It's not as good as Pillow Soft, by any stretch. More importantly, I hate the smell. It somehow manages to be both overly sweet and chemical at the same time. It's so cloying and overpowering, it's enough to make you sick. I'm nauseous whenever I use it.Having given it good ol' college try, I saw that I just wasn't going to get used to it and I ordered something else. I got a sample size of Potion 9 by Sebastian and I'm very happy with that.The DevaCurl is going to the very back of the closet. It will only see the light of day again if I run out of everything else and just have to have a little dollop of cream in my hair in an emergency.
"
"
If you have thick curly hair, I don't recommend it; on my hair, it feels like glue. I have friends with fine curly hair and they swear by it.
"
"
I have ALWAYS had an issue putting products in my hair.  I never knew it's full potential.  I had very thick, coarse ""wavy"" hair.  I have a mix of middle-eastern and Cherokee Indian in me so my hair was going to be a crazy mix.  I would straighten it all the time because if I let it air dry, it was frizzy (but not because of unruly curls, but that's just what happens to thick, wavy, coarse hair).  As I got older, I tried serums, gels, all the stuff you can get at the local monopolizing ""Mart"".  All these commercials for certain brands seemed to stack wax in my hair and it just made it difficult to work with my hair.  I met a Deva stylist through teaching Zumba and she offered to help with my hair.  WOW.From the first cut, I told her I hate putting product in my hair and she promised it wouldn't feel that way...as I watched her add...EEK - gel! GASP! Then some of this.  I said, ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" and she said to trust her.  So, she proceeded to dry it, scrunched it and whoa.  Soft, shiny, beautiful wavy hair? Really? After all she just put in? I was hooked.So, after I wash (or co-wash on my days off of washing it), I mix this with the Arc Angel gel (or now Ultra-Defining is what they call it).  I scrunch it in, dry it and then scrunch to remove the cast.  I am in love with the Deva product and the fact that they do not weigh the hair down.  All those commercials on TV are full of poo...this is finally something that does what it says (as long as you follow the ENTIRE plan).  I use the Deva gloves (or a cheese/flour cloth in a pinch) to dry it (as a regular towels loops are too thick and will cause the curls to separate and frizz).  My hair is gorgeous.  My own mother has switched to the complete line after seeing what my hair has become capable of.  And, now, after 3 years of using it, even if I don't dry it and let it air dry, with just a little bit of condition left in (I always leave the One Condition in), it dries curly and beautiful (just don't usually have the volume, but after some scrunching, it's fine).I love this cream.  I love the whole Deva line and I'm really happy with how it works!
"
"
Leaves hair curly, and moisturized, with a small amount of the product. All the DevaCurl products are great -- my granddaughter has very curly hair, and these have worked great for her too.
"
"
Good product
"
"
Prompt shipping, love this stuff!
"
"
Works better than most on my 3b curls.  Give hold, definition, and smells good.
"
"
Lightweight hold
"
"
Not watered down as so many products on here are! I love this stuff. Makes my curls so much prettier and bouncier.
"
"
Works great!
"
"
Love this product! I use it when my hair is wet and dry and it always makes a huge improvement on my frizz.
"
"
I have very curly Botticelli-type curls and live in a high humidity area. This product does control frizz and smells divine. I would definitely purchase this again.
"
"
I am naturally curly-haired, I just need a little finesse to the curls them selves, this product should be used after towel drying but when hair is still damp for the best results.  I have tried to apply this product when the hair is dry which is what the directions tell you to do, but it just came out sticky.
"
"
It's nice but not very different from other mousse or other hair products i have tried.
"
"
Adds that extra moisture my hair so craves!  I mix it with my Light Defining Gel right after No-pooing and One Conditioning. Great product for my Botticelli/Corkicelli curls!A comment on the packaging: While I very much appreciate the pump mechanism; it allows for ALL the product to be used, It is a bit difficult pumping the product out without anchoring against my body for that extra strength.I recommend this and all Deva Curl products.  My hair has changed and come to it's natural life!
"
"
THE BEST curl cream. Keeps my curls soft and keeps the frizz away. Love the smell, love the product!
"
"
My curlygirl stylist uses it with deva an-gel, but there it takes time, the hair dryer, etc! & the final curly styling looks great.  Personally, I find it leaves my hair feeling kind of heavy, but as if there's too much hair product on it.  Dom't see a need to re- buy--An-gel after one condition has always worked great for me.
"
"
Does a good job but doesn't smell fabulous.
"
"
This styling cream creates soft curls, it is not a sticky product, gives a soft hold without weighing curls down.
"
"
I have fine curly hair but a lot of it. I have been using deva curl defining gel and really like it.  I thought I would try this because my hair has been try and damaged lately from coloring.  This left my hair weighed down and sticky looking.  Love the Deva curl products but if you have fine hair stick with the gel.
"
"
Love this product.  Not heavy and really tames the curls.
"
"
This product does what it says and is a welcome addition to my normal hair routine. I recommend this product.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair that is on the thin side so I have to use something that won't weigh my hair down.  This is a great product - it enhances my curls perfectly.  I normally just put this in my hair when it is wet and let it air dry - even being in humid Florida this works great.
"
"
This stuff was terrible on my hair.  I have curly ringlets medium course very thick medium length hair. I'm bi racial so my hair is not completely like a black person's hair but it's also not like a white person's hair either.. its really right down the middle. I started out by putting a little bit in my hair working it through the curls with my fingers with towel dried hair.  Since it was spendier than other hair products I was thinking that this must be a really good strong product that they're selling. I had seen people on their website and on their Instagram page with different ethnicities so I was thinking that they knew how to cater to curly hair on all different types of heads. Wrong. when I used a minimal to medium amount my hair was very frizzy it was very dry only some of the curls came out defined and in ringlets the rest was like a crazy cat ladies hair...so i was obviously frustrated. I decided that I would give it one more shot and I used a decent amount of the product which I'm used to  because my hair is so thick. I've always had to use a lot of product so it not working when I use minimal product didn't completely shut me down as far as optimism. I went ahead and I used almost a third of the container which is obviously a lot of product but again I've always had to use a lot of product in my hair and using a smaller amount of this product wasn't working so after doing that my hair was slightly limp during the drying process (from allot of product)  but STILL to my surprise my hair (especially) around the top and around the roots was crazy frizzy when it dried.  it was embarrassing....it took all day to air dry. some of the ringlets at the bottom were more  defined than when I had used a minimal amount but the amount of frizz and dry hair throughout my head was just unbelievable this stuff is not great its not even good and to top it off the pump broke so I returned it to Amazon which I was going to do anyways because of the product not working and the price. This might be for other people's hair and I'm happy for them if it works but this is not for my type of hair and I'm really disappointed. also the product made my face break out from I'm assuming the product on my pillow case from when I'm sleeping. #fail. ******product search update******  Oyin products are amazing.  I just started using them but they're cheapest on Target's website
"
"
It is kind of heavy.
"
"
love this stuff
"
"
Absolutely love this product! Really defines and enhances curls
"
"
I have been a Deva Girl for a long time.  Just found this product and I love it!
"
"
The construction of the bottle needs work.  A failure has kept us from using the product inside. Previous shipments arrived fine, and the product performed satisfactorily.Three of these 5.1 Oz bottles arrived with the dispenser heads cracked away from the container. What a mess.  The outer box that they arrived in was not damaged except for scuffing, and the bottles themselves were surrounded by those little plastic air pillow things that separated the bottles from an unrelated product in the same order.  The unrelated product did not weigh anything to have bumped against all three bottles.I guess these could have failed after high altitude air cargo transport, but being winter, I doubt these containers saw too much internal pressure from high ambient temperatures.Amazon has made good under their damaged in shipping policy, but I have to wonder why these bottles are so fragile in the first place to not be able to withstand a routine delivery.
"
"
I have looser curls & fine hair and think this cream might be a little too heavy for my type of hair. I also wish the scent was stronger. I recommend for anyone with thicker hair, but not for me.
"
"
Yes, LOVE it....3 pumps, rubbed in hands, placed on newly washed and fairly wet curly, thin hair.....I wind up with curls that don't get frizzed out looking.
"
"
nice addition to the arcangel.  does leave hair a little gummy though but it looks great and has nice hold
"
"
Doesn't really do much for my frizzy, curly 2C/3A hair. Nice smell, but doesn't provide all day hold and definition like OGX Argan Oil Defining cream. I had heard great things about DevaCurl, but they are overpriced and don't live up to the reputation, at least with this product.
"
"
It doesn't seem to work the best for curls and the biggest drawback is that it smells like teriyaki. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't do returns of health and beauty, so I will try to endure it but I think I may just toss it. Sad. I do like the other DevaCurl gel product.
"
"
Nice product.  Had good results!
"
"
This is my 6 th tubeI’ve spoken thru email to the ceo of this amazing product.I have had skin cancer over the past 20 yrs and this is so healing and the bumps on my neck are gone, I Literally put this on head to toe twice a day out of the shower.  I no longer use moisturizer for my face and body, I only use this .
"
"
Make my curls look great.
"
"
Works amazing
"
"
I have very curly hair and this produt works well. makes my hair feel soft and still keeps the curl nice. shipping was quit and product came as decribed
"
"
This product did not work well for me. It give me frizzier hair and it made my hair look and feel very dry.
"
"
Didn't help son's hair.
"
"
I love this stuff! It defines my curls and feels light in my hair. I tried the other one that Deva Curl has that has got coconut in it too. It also works but make sure you like the scent of coconut before buying. The scent is pretty intense. But as for this one, I have bought it about 5 times now and will continue to buy it in the future.
"
"
Great!
"
"
I bought this instead of my usual DevaCurl ArcAngel gel to give it a try. I was not disappointed by the hold at all. It did a great job, using relatively little product when compared to the handful of ArcAngel gel that I usually use. I was happy to find that I got the same results scrunching the product into dry hair as wet, something that I can't really do with gel. This product holds my thick, coarse hair into very well-behaved curls and lasts an entire day.The one drawback, however, is that you can't ""scrunch"" your curls to break up the product once your hair dries like you can with the gel. So my hair does look like it has product in it. If that's a concern for you, I'd stick with the gel.
"
"
I have naturally curly and frizzy hair.  Living in the humid state of LA doesn't help.  This product does help, a lot.  I can blow dry my hair straight and it works, or just apply product and let my hair air dry.  This product works great.
"
"
Makes lovely loose curls!  I love it!
"
"
The BEST product ever for your natural curls.

I've heard great things about DevaCurl salons and products, but this probably just isn't the right product for me.  I have very fickle curls that need a stronger hold to create and keep good curls going throughout the day.  This product kept my hair fairly soft and frizz free, but more wavy than curly.  I prefer Catwalk Curl Cream, which is much more heavy and does the job well.

Perfect for curly hair

Good

This has been a great product for my finer curly/wavy hair throughout the dry winter.  I may need to cut back on it as the humidity dials back up in spring, but this is definitely a keeper in my routine!
"
"
I like to use this when my hair seems a little frizzier. It handles that better than the gel. However, my son complains every time I use it. The scent is sooo strong. It is overpowering, way too much. I will not purchase again.
"
"
I thought this product would leave my Curly hair nice and soft but its very sticky and would not recommend. Maybe their other products are better.  I will not purchase any to find out though.
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE the Deva Products.  This product smoothes my hair and really defines my curls.  Great feel and wonderful smell.
"
"
I love this whole line of products but this isn't my favorite. It works ok but after the first day that I used it, it made my hair flat.
"
"
This stuff is great for naturally curly/wavy hair.  What I love about this over other mousse/gel is that you just put it in - no scrunching necessary! It defines your waves/curls quite nicely.  The one caveat is that it's not a replacement for frizz-reducer.  While it does reduce frizz overall, you may still need serum/something else to tame the frizz at your crown in the new england summer!
"
"
unfortunately, it didn't work well for my hair. no curl definition and the smell isn't so pleasant either.
"
"
I loved the seller the product smells wonderfully but as a African American he did not do wonders for my hair I just liked the smoothness of it and the ingredients that make up this product I will order from this seller again.
"
"
My stylist recommended DevaCurl and I love it! Really holds the ""scrunch""!
"
"
If you have curly hair, this is the best product on the market!!!!  A+++++++
"
"
I use Deeva no poo and conditioner.  I Love this product's scent, sets natural curls for a few days without making hair stiff (depends on how much you use), best if applied to wet hair.
"
"
Great for smoothing the frizzies out of your natural curls. Leaves hair shiny with natural curls. I recommend this product to all who have naturally curly hair.
"
"
Love this product it leaves my hair moisturized. Smells great and a little goes a long way
"
"
Great item, Fast shipping.
"
"
Deva curl is curl!
"
"
Hate the smell! 😕
"
"
Works good
"
"
sucks don't waste your money
"
"
Had to use more product per application than expected.
"
"
Definitely NOT a real DevaConcepts product.  I compared it to the original and not even the consistency was the same.  Be careful of knock offs....
"
"
Love the way this smells and how it smooths my hair.
"
"
Can't live without this!
"

My hair is naturally very curly. I recently cut off 8 inches to donate and was looking for a product just to help give me curls more definition. When they dried at first, they looked beautiful and then by the next day, all the curls in the back of my head were gone and my hair was practically straight! Not worth the money at all.
"
"
Another maybe-I'm-secretly-rich purchase but it really is the only thing that somewhat tames my frizz. Hermione Granger must have used this before the ball, though WHY WOULDN'T YOU USE YOUR MAGIC IF YOU'RE SO SMART, HUH?
"
"
Horrible product! I have naturally very thick, curly, frizzy hair and I’ve heard wonders about “DevaCurl”. It is the worst product I have ever put in my hair. It makes it extra frizzy even with a diffuser. I do not and will not recommend this product to anyone. It isn’t even worth 1 star. I’m going to stick with my Redken and Kenra products. Their products are amazing and actually work!
"
"
After reading all the reviews, very surprised this did not work for my baby fine, naturally wavy hair. After shampooing, I use 2-3 pumps, work it through, and scrunch with a towel. When my hair dries, it's totally frizzed. Is there something I'm doing wrong with this?I'm bummed. I hate paying $30 for Bumble and Bumble curl conscious defining cream, but B&B seems to be the only product that keeps the frizz at bay all day.
"
"
This product does set your curls, but I find that it leaves a heavy film to the hair. My hair does not have a soft and silky texture after applying this product. I am going to apply this product underneath the hair, instead to the top of the hair and see if that will make a difference. I would not buy this again in the future.
"
"
So far so good, make my curly hair perfect.
"
"
I've tried so many styling creams to find the ""holy grail"" of products, and I have to say, this is definitely a holy grail product.Like many other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way. I mix about 2 pumps of this with DevaCurl AnGel and scrunch it in my hair upside down (I do this with pretty sopping wet hair). Then I take an old cotton t-shirt and scrunch the excess water out.I'm careful not to touch my hair too much, or I put a braid in my hair and wait for it to dry. I always come out with shiny. bouncy curls.I am in love with this cream and will continue to buy it. Plus the smell is absolutely AMAZING. Definitely would recommend this to any of my curly haired girls.

My old favorite AG gel styling product was discontinued a couple of yrs ago, and I tried probably a dozen other products and nothing was workrf well for me: Either not enough hold, or a hard crunch, or they made my scalp itch like crazy. (i kept bringing them to work to give to my co-workers!) Finally I discovered DC and tried an assortment of their products - I found the Styling Cream works by far the best for my wild loopy wavy/curly hair (think ""Medusa"") that tends to also have a halo of frizz on humid days. The Styling Cream has no crunch, but good hold, creating nice tame pretty curls, lite moisturizing, and no itchy scalp ever. It doesn't gunk up your hair either - I can still go 2 or 3 days between shampoos. The scent is fine, though i'd prefer something lighter or lemony, this one is totally fine and non-offensive. I can still get a bit of frizz on humid days, but a little light spray really helps that. Now i've finally found my HG styling product, I'm so afraid they'll discontinue it, so I started hoarding it!
"
"
Not impressed with this at all.  The minute it dries, hair is frizzy and dry. I've tried it a few times and keep getting the same results. The directions say it can be used on dry hair so i tried that to see if it would help moisturize but then i had to use so much product that hair was heavy and weighted down. My hair is 2b/ 2c. I expected it to at least moisturize and reduce the frizz. Even tried it with gel and still does not work.  I honestly get better results with plain coconut oil.

Thank goodness for Devacurl products.I have thick curly hair and live in South Florida.  Humidity is my enemy, but Devacurl is my friend!  Over the years I have used pretty much every product manufactured for curly hair, and Devacurl is by far my favorite.All the Devacurl products are water-based.  This is important because you can simply rinse to remove the product.  Those of us with curly hair know that shampoo is our enemy.  If I could, I would never shampoo my hair. But that would be disgusting! So I simply rinse my hair thoroughly to remove product on a day-to-day basis.The styling cream gives my curls some added shine and definition.  I use the styling cream together with the ultra defining gel and set it free spray.  I also always use a heat protectant spray.  When I get out of the shower I spray the set it free, then the I use about a dime-size amount of Styling Cream for my shoulder-length thick hair.  Make sure you really emulsify the product in your hands before you apply it.  Then gently scrunch your curls, making sure you don't just apply to the outer layers.  The styling cream creates exactly the definition my hair needs without adding weight.

I have thick, wavy, somewhat coarse, hair that is also color treated blonde.  I blow dry and flatiron my hair about 1/2 the time to wear it straight and the rest of the time I scrunch it when wet to wear it wavy.  For a long time I thought it didn't like my hair wavy, but then realized it was only because I hadn't found the right product to style it. Up until recently I was using (and loved)a Livingproof No Friz product for curly/wavy hair, but then they seemed to have discontinued the one I was using.  I thought about switching to something else in their line but since I was also annoyed that they discontinued their largest size (having thick, long-ish hair, I'm all about buying in bulk), I decided to keep my options open.  I discussed it with an employee at Sephora who also had wavy hair.  Her advice was that if I was going to only go with a cream (and not switch my shampoo or conditioner) I'd be better off going with Livingproof, but I was willing to do the whole system, she thought I'd like DevaCurl better.  Initially I wasn't keen on switching my shampoo and conditioner since I'd finally found a system that worked (I've been using Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel 2x a week to counteract brassiness, and Davines Oi the rest of the time for moisture).  But then when comparing prices I realized that DevaCurl was much, much more affordable and would still allow me to use sulfate free products.  So I figured, ""Why not?""  If it didn't work out, I could always return it.So I ended up purchasing the DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser, 945 ml / 32 oz,Deva Devacurl One Condition Conditioner, 12 Ounce, this styling cream, and Deva Curl Light Defining Gel (Formerly Angel) 32oz.I've been using them for a week and I absolutely love this system.  My hair feels soft and healthy and the wave definition is definitely on par with what I was getting from Livingproof.  My waves stay put all day and look beautifully defined.  I also don't need much product to make my hair look great, even with thick hair, so the longevity on this seems good.  I've also tried the No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner on the days I flat iron my hair along with my Davines THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair still looks great even straight so I think at least the shampoo and conditioner are versatile enough to use on straight and wavy days.The only thing I don't love about this styling cream is the smell.  To my nose, it reminds me of bubblegum and is kind of sickly sweet.  It's odd because the rest of the line has a pretty benign smell so I'm not sure why this cream smells the way it does.  Thankfully, this isn't a hair product where the scent lingers, at least when used with the rest of the system.  The bubblegum scent hits me hard when I apply it, but over time it seems to go away.So far, I'm absolutely loving DevaCurl and can't wait to try more products in the line.
"
"
I'm starting to think I must be doing something wrong since so many reviewers praise this product. I've had pretty good results with DevaCurl's No-Poo and One Condition, but all of their styling products seem to promote the conditions I'm looking to avoid.I'm a guy with dry and frizzy hair that I have been trying to tame ever since I grew my hair out two years ago. I've gone to Sephora and tried every brand that they carry, including Devacurl. Unfortunately, this styling cream turns my hair into a fluffy, frizzy, dry, undefined mess.
"
"
I have looked EVERYWHERE for something to help my half-Asian hair (now post-menopausally slightly wavy) look styled. I have been walking around with frizzy, wilted curls and while other parts are more straight. Ugh. I tried Kerastase Oleo Relax (not strong enough though I love the brand), B&B Surf Spray (made my curls look poofy and weird and dry not at all like my hair looks when I've been sailing), Moroccan Oil, argan oil, and others.I live in AZ and travel to CA often so I was hoping to find something (anything, please) that would make my hair looks defined and healthy in dry AZ and slightly humid, beachy CA. I have course hair and I like that just-out-of-bed look without the frizz and that's what I got.This cream is the bomb! I tried it on wet hair (after finger combing) and hoped for the best. When my hair dried there were defined waves and I was stunned (and happy). The next day (I don't wash every day) a little water on my hands and ran my fingers through my hair and I was good to go. Thank you thank you Deva Concepts for a product that works on my weird hair!

So I don’t write reviews on here…BUT…I had to this time.  I have fine hair but a lot of it.  It’s not typically tight curly  BUT my hair has curl; just not all over…yes it’s strange.  I prefer it to be curly as it’s simply easier to take care of and I am not someone who wants to take any time with my hair.  I have rather short hair at this time and it is now grown out just long enough to go back to curling it without looking like a clown with a hangover.I have tried about 14 zillion curling products…no seriously the path of 80% unused product bottles wraps around the globe, my tree hugging eco Portland ego is ashamed to admit.  Either they are to heavy or to sticky or make my hair look matte and dull or I end up with that crunch…you know what I am talking about…the crispy crunchy invisible coating that god forbid someone tries to run their hands through your hair they would end up with lacerated knuckles.On a whim I asked my hairdresser for a recommendation and I ended up walking out with Deva Curl Cream and it has changed my life…okay that was a bit dramatic but my hair looks hella cute and I have gone from the droopy frizzy lame semi curls to soft spiral loopy curls.  No crunch, no sticky waxy feeling.  My hair feels like hair.I will say a little goes far.  I have found that it works best if you rub it in your hands really good before applying.  I simply scrunch it in from roots to ends and I am done. My hair dries soft and my curls are bouncy.  Happy customer!
"
"
I like how Devacurl defines my curls, but I really don’t like he smell.  Am I the only one who thinks Decacurl smells bad?  I use the No-Poo original and the conditioner original and they both smell sort of like a faint hair dye.

This and the Deva Curl Spray Gel 8oz are the two newest products in the Deva lineup, and I picked both up the other day at my local beauty supply store. I have Wavy hair, and since the Styling Cream is targeted towards botticelli and corkscrew curls, I wasn't sure if it would work for me.  I decided to try it, though, since I've had good luck with most Deva curl products -- and it's been working great on my fine, wavy hair -- turning my waves into botticelli curls and soft spirals!The directions on the bottle are pretty vague, as they are on most Deva bottles: ""For added definition and lift, follow with DevaCurl Spray Gel to roots and crown."" Since this is pretty moisturizing and since on their Facebook page Deva said you could use this in lieu of One Condition as a leave-in, I've been using about three pumps on my hair (which is about three inches past my shoulders), and then have been topping it with AnGel.  I then clip, add some of the new Spray Gel on my roots and ends, and dry.  The result is soft, defined curls.When I started following the Curly Girl method a little over a year ago, I actually used other brands, before finally trying out the Deva line. I've been using it exclusively for a few months, and my hair has never looked better. My red color hardly fades, and my waves are shiny and healthy. I really love their products!

This cream is amazing. It is moisturizing and contains no ingredients that dry out your hair. I have very fine, wavy hair that is prone to frizz. There are countless products on the market that claim to be anti-frizz and I have tried very,very many of them. I do believe that cheaper products should work as well as more expensive ones, but have not actually had that experience. Most products make my hair dry and give no curl definition. This cream, however, brings out the best in my hair, especially combined with the spray gel. I use both products and let my hair air dry: amazing. Didn't know I could have curls like this, and it smells great. Don't waste money trying cheap products, buy one good thing. Your hair will thank you for it.
"
"
Perhaps I put too much stock into the hyperbolic claims typical of product blurbs on Amazon but I really hoped this would help my curly hair stay curly after it dries.  I even bought the Deva dryer as well in my attempt to seriously love my curly hair and discard the straighteners.  Neither product came close to the claims made in the product description.  This cream is nothing special and, for me, gel from even the least expensive sources does better to form and set curls.  Deva has spent a great deal of effort and time to assure us that, after years of fighting curly hair, they have the styling products and the magic blow dryer that will at last give us the look we want and it's all simply advertising and nothing more.  Don't spend the extra money on the Deva products and the expensive hair dryer.  I did and I regret it.

I have been looking for a hair product that I can apply to my grandaughter's hair n have not been successful until a friend told me about this.She has beautiful girls n this product helps it in the hydrating n frizz from all chemical s used in hair dyes that we use.I purchased it for my grandaughter n use it on myself as well
"
"
I love this styling cream.  It makes my hair feel hydrated and soft.  Since it is a cream you don't have to scrunch out the crunchy which is awesome!
"
"
...but it concerns me that at this price, what is offered here may not be genuine. I've been burned before.
"
"
This is the only product that I've used that is different from my normal routine.  I have broken out in a major contact dermatitis rash and skin infection.  It's bad.  I've researched other reviews online and apparently this product is not friends with those who have sensitive skin.
"
"
I am Caucasian and have extremely dry, coarse, poofy, curly hair and I have been looking for the ""perfect"" curling cream for a couple years now. After reading the reviews on this Deva Curl Styling Cream, I thought I'd give it a try. I've been using it for about 5-6 weeks now and it just hasn't worked for me. It does help the curls form a little tighter and stick together, but it doesn't supply enough moisture for my hair. The product description says it ""Provides natural hold, humidity resistance and leaves curls moisturized and frizz free."" It does help with humidity but my hair is still poofy, frizzy and dry.If you don't have dry hair it might work for you. At least it's not as expensive as other products! I think I'll be switching back to the Moroccan Oil Curling Cream after I finish this bottle.  The Moroccan Oil brand is more expensive but it provides more moisture and I like the smell much better.
"
"
Hate the initial smell but I do like how my hair responds to it. I have somewhat fine wavy/ light curly hair. I found if I mixed equal parts of DC Light gel with the DC styling cream I get better results.
"
"
Finally I have found the product of my dreams!  Run, dont walk, to get this cream.  My hair has beautiful curls, ringlets, nicely separated and feels great.  Took me years but I finally found the dream product!!
"
"
I wanted to love this product but did not.  It made my hair poofy and did really nothing for frizz.  I would definitely say in order to get anything out of this you would have to combine it with a product that helped with defining and frizz to like this product.  :\  I really like the cleansers of DevaCurl but have yet to love a styling product.
"
"
This product is awful and flattens and weighs hair. It makes hair look stringy and thin. Awful product.
"
"
I have been a user of Aveda's Be Curly for many years now, but I thought I would give this product a try. I give it 3 stars; It is okay. It smells really good, but there isn't anything spectacular about it. I actually feel like it made my naturally curly hair frizzier. I'd much rather use Aveda's Be Curly product line. The styling creme isn't as creamy and thick as Aveda's is; it feels much more watery than what I expected.
"
"
I have had this for two days and am completely in love! Perfect corkscrew curls. I will buy this again, and I'm the kind of person who, as a general rule, will not but the same product twice in a row.
"
"
Big disappointment. Made hair too soft, thus would not hold curl and became frizzy.  Would not buy again.
"
"
I just went to the salon on Saturday to get a much needed cut.  I have very long think curly hair, and have finally found products that work.  Unfortunately NONE of the DIVA products work for me at all.  My stylist recommended this, she loves it but I'm sorry to tell you, I HATE IT!!!  It is liking soaking your hair in the heaviest, waxiest conditional and trying to style your hair.  This is going right back.  I love the Moroccan Curl Cream!! Try it, it's the best.  Not only does it smell great and leave my curls bouncy and curly for days, but it smells amazing.  I'm tired of smelling like coconuts.  Sorry Diva, your products aren't for this curly haired girl.
"
"
I've always gone natural...have 3b curls.  I was excited to try the line, and if gave it a good try but it made my hair sooooo dry, snarled, and if I even touched my hair it'd break off!!!  This never happened before. I'm disappointed because I wanted to like the line.
"
"
Works for me 3b hair! Even in humidity when paired with the Heavy Deva Gel!
"
"
My hair is so grateful of Deva products!
"
"
Used it for years.
"
"
I am SO glad that Deva Curl FINALLY came out with a curl creme! I use Deva Curl's No Poo and One Condition, but am picky about my styling products and tend not to like gel. I love curling cremes though, which is why I was so thrilled when they finally came out with one. After I gently towel dry my hair with a regular towel (no rubbing!), I liberally apply the curl creme and then scrunch Set It Free into my hair, then continue to scrunch my hair with a Deva Curl towel. My hair always looks amazing when I use this, and the creme makes my hair so soft! And it smells great :)!
"
"
Works great

BEWARE OF COUNTERFEITS!  I've been using DevaCurl hair gel for 10 years and love the way it looks great from day one to day five, and even holds up for a couple of days in humid weather. I've been buying from different sources, including Amazon. This time I ordered from a company called Gold Fulfillment. For some reason the gel just didn't work. Only the ends of my hair were a bit stiff, and by the next day it was as if I'd used no product whatsoever. I kept trying since this has always been a wonderful product, and kept slathering on more. Finally I called the manufacturer to see if they had changed the formula. They said that the formula is the same, but they've been getting complaints from people who've bought on Amazon. Apparently somebody is adulterating or counterfeiting this product. Oops! They said to be sure to only buy from authorized resellers, so I checked out my other supplier and they're on the list.  This is very upsetting, since I buy a huge amount of stuff on Amazon, and rely on the reviews to make good choices, and also appreciate the integrity of Amazon itself. I have had only good experiences with their system, and would hate to see trust destroyed by counterfeit products. And this is hair gel, for #**@# (crying out loud), it's not like needing to be careful buying an expensive electronic item.  So curly girls, here's a heads up to keep those curls on your head gorgeous!. We know how dependent we are on our hair products, we curlies spend more on hair products than anybody else. DevCurl makes great stuff, I'm hooked, just have to check out the suppliers.
"
"
Ladies! Ladies! Ladies! (and Gentleman) You CANNOT and i mean cannot go wrong with this gel! I have type 4 hair - 4a ish in the back in my “kitchen” and 4b everywhere else. Now with this being said my wash and goes gotta be on point and it did just that! This officialy replaced my wash and go with my eco styler. My curls are popping and looking juicy! However just beware that if you have thick LONG hair this “trial travel size” aint for you! See here’s the secret - go to bed bath and beyond and they have the no name brand and catch is, they both have the same ingredients so one youre saving money and getting the product.The bottle i got was $11.99 for a 12 oz while this was $10 for 3oz which sounds crazy! Anywho i did my wash n go in the shower with a amazing non foggy mirror (also from bb&b) and did a slicing method (put product in your hands and slap your hair in between and slide down) and boom! Curls Poppington!Go getchu some!
"
"
Hate to give this a 1 star. The product is normally 5 stars. Buy this product from the DevaCurl site NOT Amazon. My wife uses DevaCurl and loves it. She found it here on Amazon for $14 cheaper so she bought it here. Apparently it's a knock off one. She went back to the one from DevaCurl themselves and her hair came out ""perfect"" as she says. Next day, she used the one from Amazon and says ""it's crap! I would have been better off not using any product today.""Yes, buying from DevaCurl site is slightly more money but well worth it because that way you actually get real product not some knock off with god only knows what's really in it!!
"
"
When I first applied it I was not happy because my hair became so hard and it gave me flashbacks of my cheap La Looks gel days. Well I looked at tips on youtube and they recommend your hair be fully wet. So instead of using a spray bottle I put my head under the sink. Applied gel while hair was damp and when it dried it looked and felt great. I will continue buying this product. I don't like their prices but the products are magical
"
"
I absolutely love this product! Finally after all these years of looking for a product that will hold my curls and reduce frizz, my curls have never looked better!
"
"
I thought I had wavy hair until I used this product. I hated that my waves never looked good despite using different products so I flat ironed my hair for 10 years. After using this on my sisters recommendation I found I actually have curly hair. Since buying this 8 months ago I haven't touched a flat iron. I apply to my damp hair, let it air dry, then quickly diffuse my roots with a blow dryer. Best product for curls, hands down. Will never use another product again.
"
"
I know others swear by this gel, but I have reservations about it.  I will admit with a wash and go, including diffusing my wet wavy hair,  my hair did look perfect.  It had shine, bounce and wicked waves.  I was very happy.  The problem I had came the day after.  My hair was hard, tangled,  dry and looked nothing like the day before, even after putting my hair up at night before going to bed and using a satin pillow!  The 3rd day was even worse, and so on.  Every day I had to totally wet my hair and using the LOC method but using a different curly girl product.  I couldn't wait to wash my hair again. I will give it to Deva Curl that maybe I used too much gel, but I don't think so.  IMO
"
"
I would give this 0 stars if I could. I've been using Deva products for awhile and decided to invest in a large bottle. First of all, this smells NOTHING like the genuine product. I had some left over of an old bottle I purchased from the salon, and they smell completely different. The consistency is even different. Really disappointed.
"
"
I'm Caucasian with frizzy, loose curly hair and I have NEVER found a product that works as well as this one.  Follow the directions & put in very wet hair & when it's dry break it up & it works amazingly. I don't find the product to have much of a sent at all...especially when my hair dries.  Seriously though, if you're debating on whether or not to get this, do it. It's pricey but worth it!
"
"
Sorry to tell you ladies, this seems different because it is.  I have been using Deva products since 2005 when I first moved to NYC and visited the original salon on Broadway in Soho.  I know for a fact that the product has changed, along with all Deva products.  When the company was bought out, everything changed.  The good news is, the original owner / founder is about to launch her own line, which will stick to the simple, few ingredients like the good old days.  In the meantime, if anyone has a recommendation for a great, mostly natural gel that doesn't leave my curls dry and knotty like this  does, do tell!

She found it here on Amazon for $14 cheaper so she bought it here. Apparently it's a knock off one. She went back to the one from DevaCurl themselves and her hair came out ""perfect"" as she says. Next day, she used the one from Amazon and says ""it's crap! I would have been better off not using any product today.""Yes, buying from DevaCurl site is slightly more money but well worth it because that way you actually get real product not some knock off with god only knows what's really in it!!
"
"
When I first applied it I was not happy because my hair became so hard and it gave me flashbacks of my cheap La Looks gel days. Well I looked at tips on youtube and they recommend your hair be fully wet. So instead of using a spray bottle I put my head under the sink. Applied gel while hair was damp and when it dried it looked and felt great. I will continue buying this product. I don't like their prices but the products are magical
"
"
I absolutely love this product! Finally after all these years of looking for a product that will hold my curls and reduce frizz, my curls have never looked better!
"
"
I thought I had wavy hair until I used this product. I hated that my waves never looked good despite using different products so I flat ironed my hair for 10 years. After using this on my sisters recommendation I found I actually have curly hair. Since buying this 8 months ago I haven't touched a flat iron. I apply to my damp hair, let it air dry, then quickly diffuse my roots with a blow dryer. Best product for curls, hands down. Will never use another product again.
"
"
I know others swear by this gel, but I have reservations about it.  I will admit with a wash and go, including diffusing my wet wavy hair,  my hair did look perfect.  It had shine, bounce and wicked waves.  I was very happy.  The problem I had came the day after.  My hair was hard, tangled,  dry and looked nothing like the day before, even after putting my hair up at night before going to bed and using a satin pillow!  The 3rd day was even worse, and so on.  Every day I had to totally wet my hair and using the LOC method but using a different curly girl product.  I couldn't wait to wash my hair again. I will give it to Deva Curl that maybe I used too much gel, but I don't think so.  IMO
"
"
I would give this 0 stars if I could. I've been using Deva products for awhile and decided to invest in a large bottle. First of all, this smells NOTHING like the genuine product. I had some left over of an old bottle I purchased from the salon, and they smell completely different. The consistency is even different. Really disappointed.
"
"
I'm Caucasian with frizzy, loose curly hair and I have NEVER found a product that works as well as this one.  Follow the directions & put in very wet hair & when it's dry break it up & it works amazingly. I don't find the product to have much of a sent at all...especially when my hair dries.  Seriously though, if you're debating on whether or not to get this, do it. It's pricey but worth it!
"
"
Sorry to tell you ladies, this seems different because it is.  I have been using Deva products since 2005 when I first moved to NYC and visited the original salon on Broadway in Soho.  I know for a fact that the product has changed, along with all Deva products.  When the company was bought out, everything changed.  The good news is, the original owner / founder is about to launch her own line, which will stick to the simple, few ingredients like the good old days.  In the meantime, if anyone has a recommendation for a great, mostly natural gel that doesn't leave my curls dry and knotty like this  does, do tell!
"
"
My hair has always been difficult for me when it's curly so I always use a flat iron. I have wavy curls and very thick hair and I have to use a lot of gel to keep it from getting big and poofy. I have never found a product that keeps it from being crunchy and also gives it defined bouncy curls without too much crunch. It feels natural and soft. I use the gel and cream together and can't believe how well it works. I do a little bit of drying with a diffuser and then top it off with Paul Mitchell super skinny serum.  My curls are beautiful and defined and I can finally wear it curly everyday without feeling self conscious! This stuff works like magic!
"
"
This product is great at giving defined curls without a hard crunchy finish.  I recommend combining it with a hair lotion to provide hold and touchable texture of natural hair. I used it right out of the shower when my hair was still damp/wet.  I flipped my hair over, scrunched it with about a quarter sized amount (I have medium length hair) and then put my hair up in a turbie twistie.  Slept on it overnight... in the AM I let it down to air dry the rest of the way.
"
"
this gel is literally my new curly hair staple. i started my curly hair journey last summer after straightening my hair every single day, and my hair was dead. it was very hard for me finding products that were actually good for hair and after six months of using ms jessies pillow soft curls, i have switched to a routine consisting of the devacurl decadence line for shampoo and conditioner, the curls blueberry bliss leave in ( which makes my hair feel like silk ), the devacurl supercream, and this gel. and let me tell you, this gel makes your curls last for up to five days. when i was using miss jessies, my hair could barely last a day. this gel has a little crunch while it is drying, but once you shake it out you get the most delicate and soft curls. it smells really nice and doesn’t flake or dry out hair either. thank god for devacurl!
"
"
Similar to previous comments I bought this thinking it was going to be the original formula. Unfortunately this product is not the real one you buy at ULTA. The hair ends up getting super hard and the formula is extra sticky. I bought the bottle from ulta, it looks the same, but it does not work the same. I am unsure as to the reason but I will pay $40 from now on in order to get the real product.
"
"
Works every time! A little of this magic sauce and my wavy curls have a spring in their step and are ready to take on the world. Plus, I love the language on the copy about casting ""a moisture-protective veil"" on my curls. Golly, it sounds like they're either being hypnotized or walking down the aisle. How exciting!
"
"
I've been using this for several months. I get compliments regularly on the scent of my hair and I have less fly aways. It holds my curls throughout the day. Sometimes encourages hair to be curlier if it's pretty humid. I have also switched to the Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
I ordered this product based on several but not all reviews listed.  I can't believe anyone would be happy with the results of this gel from DevaCurl.  My hair is naturally curly/wavy with a lot of potential frizz if I don't use styling or finishing products.  I don't use a hair dryer because it can be drying to my hair enhancing the fluff and frizz.  However, with that said my hair is soft to the touch.  I have never had such dry hair in my life as when I used this DevaCurl gel product and air dried.  I used it on 2 occasions, the result was dry untouchable hair and I won't continue using this product.  Whatever you do, don't waste your money on this gel product.On a lighter note I did purchase the DevaCurl styling creme from a salon and had wonderfully improved results with soft well formed curls and no frizz especially when applied to wet hair.
"
"
Don't know what this is but didn't make my hair look or feel like how it did when I first used this gel a few months ago. This amazon version is weird. Makes my hair even worse. Hair is 3b/3c with a little 4a in the back.
"
"
Going into this i thought it was going to leave my hair hard, and nasty, so i was a little bit skeptical but after watching a review on youtube, I absolutely love this! It DOES NOT leave my hair crunchy or hard like other gels that've gotten before. Its probably the best thing that has happened to my hair. It does emphasize my natural waves that i already have.I just grab a little while my hair is still wet, and scrunch it into the ends of my hair, then i get a little more and scrunch it into the roots of my hair, and it leaves it perfect!
"

The most amazing product for curly hair I’ve ever tried. I couldn’t recommend more for anyone with wavy or curly hair. It makes my hair much curlier than its ever been able to be with any other products - creating lots of ringlets that normally wouldn’t form. It gives my hair volume and definition without being crunchy or too stiff. It’s also so moisturizing - even after days in my hair, I wash it out and it’s not at all dry feeling - it actually feels more moisturized which is the opposite of what any other product would’ve done in the past. I use it with the curl cream and it’s just perfect. I couldn’t be happier.
"
"
I have curly, not very thick, freeze, long hair (I’m Mexican, our hair texture is different) tinted hair with highlights.I did what the brand recommends, I didn’t like how my hair feels, the texture is ugh!I’ve been used Ouidad and Curly Hair products the last 3 years, and I will continue using those brands, yes more expensive but it worth it.
"
"
How do I buy a vat of this stuff? Since I was 12 my hair has been a shapeless puff of fuzz. Not straight, not wavy, not curly. Just thick and frizzy. I have tried lots of products over the years in an attempt to give my hair form and most of the time I'm left with a crunchy mess. There is absolutely no stiffness with this. My hair feels so soft now and smells like the organic soap aisles at the store. AND look at my beachy waves! Seriously, I haven't had a good hair day in a long time. I needed this.
"
"
I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks.  I so want to like it. My hair is wavy/curly, thick, just above shoulder length. I find the scent of DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel lovely and it's fun to use. Gives a wonderful shine to my hair. As far as creating curl...I guess my hair is the wrong type for this. It gives my hair volume, makes the really curly part more curly, but the wavy part is odd from the gel...tangled and frizzy. I definitely have to use a curling iron/flat iron to create style, which seems opposite of what this product should do. I also tried the lighter gel and had the same results. I'm going to use the gel for root volume; hopefully that's the benefit I'll receive from it.

My favorite Curly Girl approved gel.  I have type 2b/2c curls and this one just does it for me above others I’ve tried.  I use it after I’ve turned my shower off and have applied a leave-in conditioner (I usually use just a regular conditioner as a leave-in).  I scrunch out the excess water as much as I can, then apply quite a lot of this gel, scrunching it in and squeezing out more excess water in the process.  Then I use a microfiber towel to scrunch out more moisture then “plop” with it for about fifteen minutes.  Scrunching out as much moisture as possible before, during, and after applying the gel really helps with setting my curl pattern for the day and speeds up drying time considerably.  I usually air dry or sometimes diffuse.  When my hair is completely dry, I break the gel cast by “scrunching out the crunch.”  All of this leaves my hair soft and bouncy without weighing it down.  I’ve tried other CG approved gels, but this one works for me and my routine.  Other types of curls might have different results.  If you are just starting the curly girl method, good luck and your hair will thank you.
"
"
I finally found my product! I live in Coastal Georgia where there is a lot of humidity. My hair does not frizz with this product. I also don't wash my hair very often and the gel will last through to my next wash without reapplying. I can put my hair in a bun and let it or without any scrunchy creases. Worth the price. My hair is very soft and not crunchy at all. I receive a lot of compliments on my hair now. I apply this in layers, that is the key. No diffuser necessary.
"
"
Like the other reviews, this stuff is the bomb. I have wavy hair, and this really makes it curly. Follow the instructions - I comb my hair in the shower with conditioner and don't comb it again after. I put this in and scrunch, and about an hour later when my hair is more dry, I scrunch again to get rid of the ""wet"" look, and viola - perfect curls!
"
"
DO NOT BUY THIS. IT IS FAKE. I have used plenty of Deva curl products in my day. This is a fake, whatever this is smelled nothing like Deva products. I have another bottle ordered from devacurl themselves. You are MUCH better off buying from their website. DO not buy this, whatever crap they give you is very drying for your hair. Don’t use it. Don’t buy it.Very sad that they pull this kinda crap considering the cost of production already being so low. Pathetic
"
"
I love deva products. However this is not real deva. I used to work for a professional beauty supply store but after having my child I gave up the job. Ive always been told never to buy professional products like this online because there is a chance of tampering. Well sure enough and despite the good reviews...this was clearly not real deva product. This was very watery and had almost no hold. Caused my hair to feel dry and look frizzy. Even in my daughters super super curly hair was frizzy and felt dry. I have some real deva curl light holding gel and it worked way better and had way befter definition than this. Save your time and money. Do not buy this.
"

Since flat ironing my curly hair for too long, I thought I had totally lost my natural curl. Or it was a product of age - or possibly both. I've tried very expensive curly hair products, drug store brands, you name it. Then I found this. It is amazing. Never crunchy or stiff, never sticky, and if you follow the directions you get beautifully defined curl or wave. I'm even hoping my corkscrew curls might return one day.Pay no mind to the user name, I'm a female with shoulder-length hair, purchased this on my husband's Amazon account. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!
"
"
I'm in love. I always hated my curls thinking if I wanted my hair to be curly I had to use mousse or gel that made them look crunchy and (in my opinion) unattractive. This gel is the opposite of that and especially paired with the coconut curl styler my curls come out soft, defined, and gorgeous. I never knew I could love my naturally curly hair this much.
"
"
i have been going through a lot of different creams and puddings for my hair.  just discovered the devacurl line and the no poo movement and finally figured out that my 3a needs a gel to help set up the curl.  i love this gel and the smell is great.  i recommend that you check out books on curly hair to see what type you had and then match up your products to your type.  i also recommend using just conditioner to wash and a leave in to condition.  this has been working for me so far.
"
"
DevaCurl offers the best products I've found for my naturally curly hair.  My regimen has been tremendously simplified.  I used to practically have a chemistry lab of hair products, and would mix and match them in different ways.  Now I wash my hair with Devacurl No-Poo and use the Ultra Defining Gel after towel-drying my hair.  No conditioner needed!  No other goops or lotions to apply, unless I want to feel like a mad scientist.  It's magic stuff.  I've never received so many compliments on my hair as I have since using DevaCurl.  It also helps that the Ultra Defining Gel gets a score of 4 and No-Poo gets a 2 on the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep database!No one gave me any items free in exchange for an honest (or other) review -- but I wish they had.
"
"
Started buying Deva products through our stylist, then through Ulta to be able to get the reward points.  I was hesitant to buy online because I'd seen some reviews about Deva products being watered-down, but the gel we purchased came in exactly the same consistency as the bottles we've purchased in-person through Ulta and at the salon.  The savings far outweigh any reward program at the beauty store, so we will definitely be purchasing our Deva shampoo, conditioner and gel through here in the future.
"
"
I have REALLY THICK hair so my curls are always weighed down. I used this product and it brought out my curls! I really love the fact that it doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy or crunchy. Feels like my regular ol natural curls!
"
"
I was so excited to try this product after seeing so many positive reviews. Unfortunately, I did not have the same experience as most people. I bought the smallest bottle because it was pricey and I did not want to spend too much without trying it first. I followed the instructions, but because of the size of the bottle, I did not use too much. No product has ever made my curls look so ugly. It is somehow even worse than when I leave my curls alone. Once I decided I was not happy with the product, I decided that maybe the problem was how little I used it, so the second day I applied the product liberally.... My curls looked better but by the time my hair dried, my curls looked frizzy and matted. I do not at all recommend this product. People have always complimented my curls when I'm using products such as John Freda or even Suave (cause sometimes I'm broke!!) but both days I wore this product, I had people asking me what was wrong with my curls. It's a bad sign when your husband ask you ""did you go to work looking like that?!""
"
"
I was skeptical of this stuff. I do not spend money on myself, especially $30 for a hair product I've never tried before. But omg I'm so glad I did! I have actual curls now instead of stringy waves. It does dry my hair out kind of after 2 weeks, so I take a day off once every 2 weeks and just use a leave-in (Shea moisture). I was so nervous using a GEL but it works wonders and once you scruch out the crunch, you're left with soft, gorgeous curls!
"
"
I’ve used this product for years. There’s no way they did not change the formula. In recent months, I noticed a change in the look and feel of the product. I didn’t think anything of it. However, I wish I had. Deva curl products have ruined my hair. It’s as if they put relaxing chemicals in their products. Some strands of my very curly hair have become completely straight while others have just loosened. It has also changed the texture of my hair. I am mortified. I saw that people were speaking out but didn’t stop using their products because I didn’t see a change in my own hair but I trusted them too much and now my hair is damaged. Even if you haven’t seen a change in your hair, please stop using these products. It’s not worth it to wait and see if it will ruin your hair too.
"
"
My hair with no product is wavy & very frizzy.  This product did put more curl in my hair which is why I gave it 2 stars but it did nothing to help with the frizz. For the expensive price I was expecting it to help with the frizz too & was hoping it would be the only product I would need to use.  I tried putting the gel on as soon as I got out of the shower while my hair was still very wet & before I put on the towel & I tried putting it on after I had my hair wrapped in my towel while putting on makeup. (I use t-shirt material for a towel) Neither way worked. I'm going back to the combination of products that have been working for me.
"
"
I have thick coarse wavy, sometimes curly hair (think of coochie hair on the head).  This product isn't all it's cracked up to be. It didn't keep my hair from frizzing after it dried. Once it dries, it leaves this funky feel to your hair and forget capping or wrapping your hair, sleeping and waking with something manageable or pretty because I haven't. God forbid if you brush it. This product was recommended to me but it just wasn't a good fit. On the positive side, hence 2 stars, it smell wonderful,
"
"
I am a gel junkie. I tend to use Eco Styler with great results but was looking to try a softer gel to reduce the crunchiness of my hair. This gel dired out my hair with ZERO definition and very little hold. I do not recommend. I tried using less, and I tried using more. Now to use it up, I use it to hold twists in place when I'm protective styling - and even then, I can tell by how my twists feel that my hair is completely dehydrated.
"
"
I have thick, long, wavy hair that's in-between the wavy and curly side. This product is ok, but I found that it easily gets my hair into almost irreparable knots if I'm not careful. It gives a nice hold, but if you aren't careful with your timing of when you put it on, you can just end up making your hair look messy. It's not bad enough for me to quit using the bottle, but I'm not sure I'll purchase again,I've read a lot of positive reviews, but maybe this isn't for my hair type.On the plus, this bottle has lasted me FOREVER and, while it may seem like a big purchase, a lot less gets you a lot farther and you;ll probably save money in the end.
"
"
Love the smell of this gel and absolutely amazing the curls I get. I have cut my hair from the middle of my back which gave amazing curls to a long bob and it still gave me defined and cute curls. The gel itself gives great curls.
"
"
Heard about the product through r/curlyhair and wanted to try it out. However after just one use, this product has made my hair texture go from smooth to rough, dramatically increased the frizz in my hair, and barely maintained my curl pattern. I wanted to love this product - but I do not, whatsoever. Currently exploring options on returning this, because this product does not work for me.For clarity; I have South Asian black curly hair.
"
"
This is the real deal!  I watched the YouTube video to make sure I was applying it correctly to get the best curls.  It is amazing!  I got so many compliments on my curly hair the next day at work, I quit counting.  EVERYONE said I should wear my hair curly.  It is usually a big fuzzball that I flatten down with the straightener.  I have so many hair products in my closet that did not work.  I did not use their brand shampoo and conditioner first either.  !!  So happy with this purchase.
"
"
the absolute best and only curly product i use after trying many many many different things. Put it in your hair when your hair is SOAKING wet, and IF it's at all crispy when it dries, clap your hands over your hair. You look crazy for a second but then crazy GOOD all day! ;-) splash your hair with water the next day to reactivate and get a 2-day 'do out of it.
"
"
I bought 3 of deva curl products and this was one of them, I LOVE the way it leaves my hair and how it defines my curls, at first when you apply it and defuse your hair it leaves a little cast, not too much, then when you scrunch the crunch it leaves your curls soft and defined, I was amazed how long my curls lasted and I only used a little bit, I will be buying this gel again and recommend it to all my friends.
"
"
I use this along with the DevaCurl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam as a finishing touch for fly aways after using a diffuser. My hair doesn't curl very well with using the gel wet and allowing to air dry like the instructions suggest on the bottle.  This gel gets a little crispy, which isn't my preference when use it with my diffuser, so like I said, I generally use it as a finishing touch vs a main product.
"
"
I bought this because of the good reviews and because it was cheaper than Ouidad Curl Quencher Gel (which my hair LOVES!).  This stuff is AWFUL.  It feels very heavy on my hair.  Now I am stuck with a Liter bottle.  I will use it to completion because I cannot afford to buy anything else now, but this stuff is truly awful on my hair.  Kudos for the peeps who CAN use it!  I just cannot.
"
"
So happy I bought this. I finally took the plunge and went to a curly hair specialist recently and he was a miracle worker but the biggest shock was his liberal use of hair gel. Hair gel is scary and makes your hair weird and crunchy, right?? Wrong! Watch some videos about gel casting your curls and then buy this giant tub of gunk and never look back.
"
"
Read great reviews and tried the travel pack of Curly girl method and this product. I actually really liked the travel product. So I bought the large bottles in NoPoo, Conditioner, Gel and Cream. And it’s awful!!! My hair is always so greasy by the second day! I typically don’t need to wash my hair but every other or two days when I use Herbal Essence. For the money I think these products are NOT worth it. My hair was fuller which I like but it does not work as advertised by all the “curly girl methoders”. Also my conditioner arrived leaking in the box which I have YET TO RECEIVE AN EMAIL BACK O.
"
"
I love this gel! I just started learning how to deal with my curly hair and this product is wonderful. I put it on while my hair is still wet - before towel drying - and let my hair dry naturally or use a diffuser. When the hair dries completely it is mildly stiff depending on how much gel you use, but after you scrunch the hair up it softens up right away. No residue at all!
"
"
Great product.  Holds up to its claims.  After I apply this to my wet hair and scrunch it, I don't touch my hair again until it's dry, then I scrunch it again to release the crunchy gel hold, and my curls are soft and beautiful!  The other DevaCurl products I've tried have all been great, too.
"
"
This product did not do anything to help my curls. I have natural 3b corkscrew curls and a LOT of hair. I was hoping this product would further define the curls and leave them with their beautiful natural shape all day, but it really dried out my hair and left everything limp. I followed all product directions and tutorials on the Devacurl website and nothing I tried gave me my natural curls back. I returned the product and went with my tried and true - B'leav-in. It gives me the volume and definition, minus the crunch that never really went away even after I broke the cast with the ultra defining gel. If you're struggling with this product, try the other instead.
"
"
Very well pack to prevent leaking. I initially thought I'd be returning or selling this product after the trying it twice and not getting the results I'd expected. Then while complaining about it I happened to glance at the instructions. SO HAPPY I DID. Keeping my hair saturated as opposed to towel drying it before apply made a TREMENDOUS difference. Not only for the day. I no longer have bushy bed head when I wake in the morning. More than pleased. ELATED.
"
"
This product is the worst product I have ever put on my hair. I, like most people, go off of reviews to make an informed decision on what products I choose to buy, and I have never been more disappointed.I bought this product a while back, (September 2019), and from the first use I noticed that it made my hair feel rough and wiry. I thought maybe it was the shampoo or other products I was using because over 2,000 good reviews couldn’t be wrong. Fast forward to December 2019, this DevaCurl product has made more damage to my hair than Anything else I’ve ever used.Damage done by this product; rough, dry, brittle, wiry hair, and density loss.It is now February 2020, since not using this product my hair has had significant improvements.
"
"
This was my first time trying deva curls for myself and my kids, My curl pattern is a 2b and my kids are a 3b-c. Works incredibly well in both of my kids curls, defines without making them crunchy. Didn’t do as much for my curls, Might be a little too heavy for curls in the 2a-c range. Def works best if applied to hair while really wet, and it smells SO GOOD! Next time I’ll buy the bigger size since it works so well for both of my kids curls! I should also note I used it along with coconut creme.
"
"
So this gel has some pros and cons. Pros: it smells nice. I love the amount of product you get (its huge!) And the pump is great.Cons: the gel is too light for my hair. No matter how much product I use I cant get enough definition and my hair frizzes within a few hours. For this reason alone I feel that it is much too pricey of a gel that doesn't even define or hold.
"
"
This left a texture similar to if I had applied regular hair gel through my strands. My hair appeared kind of crunchy and wet all day until I brushed it out, which make it look like I hadn't put any product in at all. Using less product didn't resolve this issue either. While I don't have super curly hair, I do have defined waves that need frizz taming, but this product just didn't do it for me. I guess it's good that the product size is so small so I won't feel so bad about wasting the rest. Oh well
"
"
My hair is a combination of type 2C and 3A; my hair is thick, coarse and no porous. I gave this product a year so allow type my hair to adapt to it. This product doesn't work for me. It doesn't provide hold(nothing: no light hold, no hold at all). I used the entire line and it let my hair to air dry, after my hair dries it looks frizzy, and brittle. There is no way I can get a second day when using this product, I have to completely wet my hair and start all over again.
"
"
Love love love this!!!! I've been searching for years to find a control gel that didn't leave my hair crunchy.  This leaves it soft!  I run some through my wet hair and then run a drop through my dry hair.  AWESOME!!!
"
"
The Ultra Defining Gel is not what it used to be. I used to be able to use it in my hair and go days without washing it, just use the One Conditioner and reapply the gel, but the product leaves much more of a residue/stickiness to my hair.. I will be switching to a new product line, because I have been hearing things about the quality of their products going downhill. Such a shame, since I had thought I'd found a product that I would use for life. I tried to post a review to the DevaCurl website, but after I clicked ""Submit"" and went back to look for my review, there are only 5 star reviews there. Shady shady...
"
"
It seems to work just like the one I bought at the store! I was worried after readying and hearing that u can get bottles that will have added liquid so it’s not completely the product but it seems to be the real deal all the way!
"
"
I have short, thick, curly and frizzy hair. I used a quarter size amount of gel to hold my curls in place. At first it worked great. I liked how lightweight the gel felt on my hair and it didn't crimp like other gel products do. But the gel didn't hold up well in the humidity. My hair was still frizzy and I would add more gel to fix it, but I didn't like how my scalp felt with the product build up. I might try the brand again but with a stronger gel.
"
"
If you love Devs Curl gel, this is a good deal. The pump works really well and makes application on wet hair a breeze, as you don't have to pick up the bottle. I keep one in my shower for wash days and one in my room for refreshing. It was worth the money to have one of my favorite products right where I need it! The pump helps me use the perfect amount too, so it is lasting longer than if it was just in a regular bottle.
"
"
So i tried rhe light defining gell and 8t worked okay on my 3a/b hair but this works sooo much better at defining my hair and it actually last the hole day! The bottle size it pretty good right now (i just cut my hair to my shoulders) overall really good product. Bit on the pricey side but since i dont use that many products its not too bad
"
"
I love this line. It really works will with the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream.*****UPDATE 3.21.18*****So.. though this line is amazing and it really does define your curls. I would recommend using the cream first and then the gel. The gel really dries your hair out so if you need extra moisture definitely use the cream first then the gel then possibly another cream after. Then when you toss your hair after air drying, make sure to toss with an oil or anti frizz to help with the dryness.

Absolutely LOVE this product! For years I hated my curly hair because it would always frizz up and have that awkward wave look to it. But for the past year or so I decided to stop using heat on my hair so I not only would have healthier hair but to try and grow it out pretty long. This has been my saving grace! When using this I have beautifully defined curls and no frizz! To top it off my hair stays very soft and flowy. I will be using this as my forever hair product and will recommend this to whoever I know has curly hair. ☺

"
LOVE this gel. I have curl hair and have tried practically everything. This product comes at a slight premium but I think it's well worth it. I put it in at night after I wash my hair and let it hair dry. I wake up in the morning, scrunch my hair a bit and I'm good to go. The curls look great and they last all day. I have it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it helped a little more with frizziness.

Works great for slightly wavy hair to make it wavier - it's never crunchy!
"
"
I works great to define my curls. I have porous wavy/curly natural hair. I use this gel in my routine after I have sealed my curls with Shea Butter and scrunched with a light amount of Kinky Curly Curling Custard. The custard provides the hold but this gel makes the curls come out. A little goes a long way. It is water soluble is not sticky at all. A bottle lasts a really long time. I would recommend this gel to all the curly girls I know.
"
"
I've gotta agree with the other curlies on here. This actually does work. I have really fine but thick hair. The trick really is letting it dry ALL THE WAY before you tousle your hair, otherwise it can look a little limp. If you follow the directions if wont be crunchy. Enjoy!
"
"
Makes your hair SUPER DRY!! Felt like dry ramen noodles and looked like it too. Terrible product and a complete waste of money
"
"
I wanted to love this product to the moon and back, but I just can't. However, I will definitely be trying other DevaCurl products.This particular one made my hair feel very heavy and very oily the entire time it was on my hair. I've got long, dark, curly/frizzy hair, not to mention THICK hair and this product somehow always felt like I was putting too much in, even if it was ever only a nickle sized amount.
"
"
I have to use a lot more of this one compared to the same gel I purchase at Ulta, so while it’s cheaper I think it’s watered down or something, you end up using more, might as well go to the store and pay full price. Smells good as always though.
"
"
I just bought this about a week ago. My hair is naturally curly but this gives it the 'oomph' it needs to make it a kinky curly. I don't use the amount the directions indicate on the bottle. I use about 6-7 pumps because I have long and a lot of hair. This is why I bought the 32 oz considering I use a lot product. Once I feel I have enough gel and have scrunched up to my roots, I use a microfiber towel to dry the excess water and let it air dry. I absolutely love this product and will be buying again once I run out, which will be soon. :'(
"
"
Love it. Helps to define your curls. A little goes a long way.
"
"
Besides shampoo, this gel is the only hair product I use.  I have a shoulder length bob and it keeps my hair styled from washing to washing.  I do not need any hair spray and my hair is never sticky.  I have used it for about 6 years and love it.
"
"
I have being using the product and noticed that my curls are much curlier than before.  If I want a more defined look, then I put more but if I want a more natural look I apply less.  I used to wait 45 mins to start drying my hair but with this product I find myself starting at 30 mins.  Saves me 15 minutes, enough time to make another cup of coffee.  Love this product.
"
"
I really really wanted this gel to be the answer to my hair needs!  I read so many of the reviews and had great hopes for it.  I followed the directions and tips but this just didn't work for my hair at all.  Left it still dry and frizzy. I will be returning it.  I do have to say it smelled great!  I am truly bummed that this gel didn't work out for me.
"
"
Product does hold curls...next day, curls still good with a little scrunch from wet hands!  makes my scalp a bit itchy.
"
"
It was a let down for me. My go-to gel is Ecostyler Argan Oil and that leaves my hair soft and shiny as well as great hold for 3-4 days which is amazing because I go to the gym 5 days a week. From other reviews I thought the DevaCurl was going to be even more amazing but I found it went on while watery, dried leaving a sticky and crunchy texture and gave me 1 day hold. I've already given it away. I'm very disappointed in this product.
"
"
OK, this stuff is great!  First of all - it's vegan, so how great is that?  Not tested on animals either! (GO Devacurl!) I have fine, curly hair and it gets frizzy really easily.  I have medium length hair and I use a bit the size of a small bean.  I scrunch my hair with it and it really helps to keep my ends together and lessen the frizz.  A light pick softens it and my curls look great.  I really love this stuff!
"
"
I'm trying to get away from using hairspray, so purchasing this gel i was trying to see if my hair would still frizz at the ends and sides or would it really hold my curls and last all day. I use this on days i really don't care how my hair looks or not ""all day hair"". still in search for products.
"
"
I bought this product after my Deva hair stylist used it on me with amazing results. I was so happy that using I was able to achieve the same results at home with this gel. My curls are defined and last for days. Just make sure to use plenty of gel (more then you think you need) on super wet dry, then ""scrunch out the crunch"" once dried.
"
"
This might be the only hair styling product I've used that actually does what it says it'll do. I've been using DevaCurl products for a few years now, but I was styling my hair with the cream instead of the gel. I've always been wary of gel products because I hate the crunchy hair look, but this gel leaves your curls soft and defined. If you have curls from root to tip like I do, this will help them keep their shape all day long. The cream just didn't have the hold I needed, but this gel definitely does. Highly recommend it!
"
"
This was a gift for my daughter.  I was excited to find such a large bottle at a great price.  However, after being delivered to the wrong address and making it's way to me in it's crushed box, I opened it to find a Large bottle filled with clear gel and no label.  It appears to be a knock-off.  I also, can not give this as a gift because it looks very cheap without the label.  No indication of what is in the bottle.  I will not be purchasing DevaCurl products via Amazon anymore.
"
"
I love this gel! I used to struggle finding a gel that made my curls look voluminous, but not frizzy, until I found this product. I will be repurchasing this again and again!
"
"
This is my favorite gel ever. I wish I had this in the 80's! Make sure to keep it in the shower and apply to soaking wet hair. It will feel hard once it dries, but softens as you scrunch and release your curls. I apply a cream over the top of the gel.
"
"
Quite possibly the worst thing I've ever put in my hair.  I was looking for more body, and haven't had an issue with my curls being frizzy or unmanageable.  I used this and suddenly I look like the Lion from the Wizard of OZ.  I'll stick to Carol's Daughter.Way too flaky, sticky residue, fragrance, and made hair super dry.
"
"
This product cannot possibly be real...I can't picture devacurl making something that basically ruins your curls instead of improving them. This gel dries your hair out and makes your curls flat and straight. It makes my hair feel worse than a brillo pad. Please save yourself the hassle and buy only from the devacurl site.
"
"
I bought this for my daughter and myself. I did alot of research, talked to others who use it and watching every video made about this product. I personally felt it weighed heavy on my hair and I didnt care of it.
"
"
I like this gel but it is definitely a little more stiff than I am used too. I prefer the arc angel. My hair length is very long and this doesn't really give me the flexibility I am used too. Still love all things Deva over anything else for curls :)
"
"
I have type 3C/3B curls and low porosity hair, this product is great for defining my curls and holding them for at least 24 hours. The reason why I’m not going to use it anymore is my curls always felt dry after styling despite having great hair care products & routine
"
"
Perfect! Switched from Aveda Confixor liquid gel which was way too sticky and left my curls crunchy. The devalcurl ""ultra"" defining gel is just right with defining the curl and keeping the freeze to a minimum. I have yet to try the devalcurl light defining gel... Would say this is a must if you live in a humid climate like we have in North Carolina.
"
"
Love the fact that it's silicone free!  It works great in my hair to keep away frizz all day long.  Keeps my curls defined.
"
"
I can't say enough good things about this gel. I have a 3b/3c curls , Halve of my hair is curly and the other halve mildly relaxed and I was about to cut it. I v been using this gel since a month with devacurl no poo and one conditioner and deep condition my hair with a free silicon deep conditioner once a week, my curls are back and my hair is unbelievably soft and bouncy . Am in love with my curls 😍😍😍
"
"
REVIEW UPDATE: It was suggested that I try this gel on soaking wet hair and I must say that made a huge difference!  I put a full palm fulls in while still in the shower, wrapped my head in a microfiber towel for about 15 minutes and then gently finger combed my hair and added a little more gel where needed. I now have clumpy ringlets which is what I like.  I upped the rating to 4 stars.  This may be my go to gel now :)Downside = I found this gel to be just OK - it's holding power wasn't as strong as I had hoped for.  I have super thick 2c/3a hair and I need a harder holding gel.  I think it would work better for someone with wavy hair.  Upside = It smells divine.
"
"
Works like a charm! Trying to embrace my natural curl/wave. I did my research and after a couple of other gels, tried this. It defines the ""s-curve"" nicely and beautiful after scrunching to give my hair a very pretty naturally curly look. Doesn't dry out my hair either!
"
"
Product gel hold is amazing with no crunch effect like other products. The hold feels natural than other products. For years I was looking for a product like this. Also since using product, I no longer staightened my hair bcuz my curls have improved amazingly. For better results I do use the ✋ hair blow dryer. The two diva products that maximize my curls to look amazing the gel and mousse. I've been getting many compliments. I've so far also tried the conditioner which also is great.
"
"
Omg LOVE IT! When I use this hair gel it makes my hair stiff feeling initially but with lots of body. If you follow the directions it will work. My hair is more wavy but Made my hair a little more curly.
"
"
I wish I could give this item no stars at all because it is not real DevaCurl. The consistency is cheap and not moisturizing whatsoever. My hair felt like hay after using whatever this product even is and if you have curly hair, you know how much that absolutely sucks. I’ve used DevaCurl many times before and this was most definitely not it. Don’t waste your money or go buy it in an actual store or on their website instead.
"
"
I feel like I have cracked the curly hair code on this one. I have been fighting the war of the curl for years. This is the BEST defining gel I have ever used. Believe me I have wasted tons of money on what has not work. I first put in the Deva daily conditioner and got back over with this gel.
"
"
I have been using the Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel for at least 2 years now and I can't live without it!  I put a 3-4 pumps on my wet hair (after squeezing a little of the water out first), scrunch with a microfiber towel, and then let my hair air dry.  Once my hair is completely dry, I scrunch with my hands to ""release"" the stiffness of the gel.  I'm left with perfect, frizz-free curls all day.  I used to fight my curls and straighten my hair every day, but now I love them and this gel is a huge part of the reason!
"
"
Sadly for me, it does not feel moisturizing at all and it leaves my hair looking AND feeling dry. I have color-treated and fine hair, so I prefer the Ouidad climate control humidity gel because it makes my hair feel soft, shiny, and moisturized. I wanted to give this one a try because of the great price. I still have the full bottle and regret the purchase though.
"
"
Well I tried to get a new bottle but it was from a third party so Amazon wanted nothing to do wit it. I tried the pump after washing it. But anyway it’s a good gel. Holds my hair. It is a little hard to get my hair soft when I use it. I wait til it’s dry. Yet still it is stiff.
"
"
I've tried a lot of deva curl products. The shampoos and conditioners do not work for me. Honestly, Garnier's Curl Nourish line works better for me and is way cheaper.But I can't find anything better to style my curls with on a daily basis than this gel (which does not look at all like crunchy once your hair dries). This has a strong hold and makes curls look great. If I want my curls to feel moisturized too, I use a leave in conditioning serum along with this product.
"
"
For the price, this is not a great buy. The product is nice for curls, but you can get equitable products for much less. The gel goes quickly! Probably won't buy again.
"
"
I swear by deva curl products, I have had super curly hair my whole life and had always had a problem with the curls looking flat or frizzy. After hurting my hair very short and a long process of straightening daily my curls just weren't the same. A friend recommended the deva curl line to me and I will never go back to anything else, my curls have never looked better. This product keeps my curls looking great all day and even for the day after if I needed!
"
"
I don't like the way this holds my curls. They seem very loose and doesn't tighten up like usual. Although every hair is different it's just not for me. Smells good though and is not sticky.
"
"
Works well on my thick, wavy hair. This was recommended by a friend whose curls looked great. I ordered it right away. The first time I used it, I was pleased with the good shape and frizz control, and the spirally waves in my long hair. Not a greasy look or feel at all, my hair feels soft to touch. This is at the height of a hot, humid summer. I expect in winter I can use the same gel, just less of it.
"
"
My curls have never been so define and lasted so long without friz before. Out of all the curl defining jells and creams I've used this one leaves no residue behind. The first 2 days ur hair might feel a little crunchy but it does soften up and it holds the moisture from other products. All in all I believe it was a good bye for my tight curl patterned fro. Give it a try if ur curious.
"
"
If you are new to transitioning, it might feel too brittle for your hair but as time passes and you use it with a slip leave in or cream it will be great.. as yes scrunch out the crunch either solo or with a little of your favorite oil. Oh the scent is very strong
"
"
Literally the best gel for creating a curly mask, that I've EVER used. And I've tried 9 zillion kinds. I love how defined it makes my curls, while also keeping it soft rather than crunchy! Found my new go-to!
"
"
I saw the reviews stating it was the real Deva Curl product, but it smells the same as the product in Ulta and works as expected! Doesn't make it crunchy (if you do it correctly), and doesn't make my hair feel dry or sticky. Good price for the amount of product!
"
"
I’ve used Curvaceous by Redken for the last 15 years and after trying this product, I’ll never go back to it! I shower before bedtime and let my hair dry overnight. Very low maintenance and beautiful curls.
"
"
The best water soluble gel for naturally curly hair! I use the “rake & shake” method for getting those ringlets, and it stays for a few days! Use DevaCurl’s Mist’r to refresh those perfect curls when necessary!
"
"
First time using deva curl and I had high hopes. I have medium length natural curly red hair. It didn't leave my hair with soft curls but crunchy curls especially on my ends. It did hold my curls well for about 3 hours then got very poofy. Felt like I could of bought a cheap moose to get the same result that it left me. Crunchy is not what my hair is used to and not a good look. Will try it again with some of my normal styling products and hopefully achieve that beautiful deva curl look I've read and seen so much. Here's hoping
"
"
I wanted to try this after I started experience a ton of breakage after I had our son. I figured I better lay off the flat iron and figure out how to style my naturally wavy hair. I used WAY too much product the first time after reading suggestions from other reviews. But once I figured out the right formula for success it seems to be working!
"
"
This was not deva curl. I should have known better because of the price. It was a rip off
"
"
works well with curly hair.  i have been using it now for a few years, and nothing compares.  it give my hair some hold, but still always it to bounce and have a more natural look.
"
"
I find this product drying, but it does do a good job of creating curl without leaving the hair feeling tacky and dirty.  Some curl creme on the hair after it dries after using this product has been a good combo.
"
"
I have thick, curly hair and have difficulty finding a hair product that helps control the curl and friz. This gel does exactly what I have been looking for! I have recommended it to several of y friends with curly hair and they love it too!
"
"
Love the product was so excited to see a 32 oz bottle for $10, amazing!!! Received my order  today, it is a 3oz bottle! Don’t get tricked!!
"
"
Love this product. If you have curly hair I think it's a godsend. Best curly hair product I've used. My hair is curlier than ever and curls hold even through the windy-est of days
"
"
This gel has been a game changer for my curly hair.  I have struggled with finding a gel that isn't too ""gloopy"", too crunchy or that doesn't dry out my hair.  This product is perfect.  It provides the exact amount of control to prevent frizziness without drying out or weighing down my hair.  I LOVE this product.
"
"
My daughter is mixed race and we have had a very difficult time finding just the right product for her....until now.  Thank you DevaCurl!
"
"
leaves hair crunchy , but what i did was put some coconut oil first and then just a tiny bit of this hair gel, and i will go ahead and use it, but it is not really what i wanted, i prefer the bleave in.
"
"
This larger bottle is worth the money. The gel helps my curl, but it takes some practice to get the amount right. I use it daily, mixed with the cream.
"
"
My fellow Curly girls rejoice! this is our  best hair product ever! A little goes a long way. 1 pump in wet hair, run it thru scrunch with micro fiber towel, sit under dryer then shake out from roots. and WOW, you are ready to bedazzle them all
"
"
Do not use!!!! It causes hair damage, hair lose and pattern lose. They are being exposed with a lawsuit on how this brand has damaged people’s hair.
"
"
Everyone's curly hair needs are different, but this is the best stuff for my personal kind of very curly, but somewhat fine, hair.  It doesn't weigh it down, but keeps curl consistency and integrity while reducing frizz and unpredictability.  And no crunch!  Hair soft to the touch!  I used to use Ouidad's gel, but it was a little too heavy for me.  Like with Goldilocks, this product is JUST RIGHT for my hair's needs.
"
"
I don't know how I lived without this gel. Highly recommend using in conjunction with no poo and one condition. Apply to soaking wet hair in the shower, scrunch then use a microfiber towel to absorb the excess water. Don't touch it again until it's completely dry then shake curls from the root and scrunch to break the gel cast. It leaves my curls so defined and full of volume!
"
"
Awesome product. It's a little pricier than drugstore products, but creates amazing curl definition in my wavy/curly hair. Note that it's supposed to create a curl cast that you then ""break"" when you hair dries by scrunching--so if you hair feels crunchy, and is dry, try crunching it to release That cast!
"
"
I mix it with the cream so I get a hair cocktail that holds without crunchiness
"
"
I was always iffy to try devacurl because it was a little out of my budget, but let me tell you it’s worth every penny! I have defined, frizz free, beautiful, bouncy curls! This does not weigh down my hair or make it greasy! It’s amazing! I’ve already bought so many bottles & devacurl products.
"
"
I always thought my hair was fine and thin. Turns out I have 'heavy' hair. Things you learn when one changes hair stylists. I've tried many products, and this get is magic for my waves/curls! It will now be the main product I use! Thank you, DevaCurl!
"
"
My wife has very naturally crazy, curly hair and loves this product! It doesn't leave her hair sticky or stiff like other brands. Her curls stay in tact, soft and frizz free.
"
"
This is the first time that I purchased my gel from amazon and I think I may have a fake in my hands. It sure isn’t holding as the one I’ve purchased on the website
"
"
Even though a lot of people said it doesn’t leave curls crunchy, i felt like with my hair it does. But I’ll try using the light weight gel next time.
"
"
It does define curls but it’s not worth it. Makes my hair crunchy and hard. I usually buy styling gel or less expensive gels and works better then this.
"
"
I am now recovering from this brand that is making women’s hair fall out all over the world. PLEASE look at further info about this product online. You can follow the curl ninja on IG and YouTube for more information.
"
"
My daughter has 3C curls.  Every morning we wet her hair, add a little leave in condish, and then use this gel on the ends and let air dry.  Her hair does not get crunchy and the curls stay defined.
"
"
fake product. it doesn't smell like the real product I get from Target and it does not hold or define the curls as the original product does
"
"
Makes my curls super soft and bouncy
"
"
My friend let me use this product once and I HAD to buy it, I was hooked! It’s a very lightweight gel and it smells great! The bottle is filled to the brim and for $13 it’s a great deal. I love DevaCurl products and was more than pleased with this purchase.
"
"
love this product. Smalls great and provides decent  hold without making your hair feel hard. Doesn’t dry hair out.  My only wish is that they would make a stronger version for fine hair. Until then, I’ll keep using this.
"
"
I have B3 type hair and I absolutely love this gel! My hair doesn't have any ""crunchy"" feel to it nor does it flake after days of having it in. I'm also finding my hair has so much more curl to it because the product doesn't weigh down my curls in any way. I also loveeee that it doesn't leave a sticky residue on my hands from playing with my hair throughout the day. I went from using 2-3 products to style my hair to using ONLY this gel. I highly recommend it!
"
"
I've used this product for a long time and always purchased it at local stores. I recently realized that buying this size is much cheaper and lasts longer.
"
"
I've tried a bevy of products for my hair. I had hopes for this product, but it does exactly what I don't want gels to do.  I have naturally curly hair which tends to be dry already and this gel just dried my hair out more.  It also gave me that 1980's ""wet look"" hair of my adolescence, which I hate.  I really regret buying this product because it was expensive and now I don't intend to use it ever again.
"
"
I've been using this for a long time. And, I have liked it for a long time. Recently I bought a wig because my hair is thinning very badly and my curls are just not the curls they used to be. I still wash with No-Poo,and conditioning with One Condition, but I have been leaving out this gel. Drying it I have not been caring/careful to maintain the curls. TO MY SURPRISE, my hair feels softer and the curls are fuller. Still thinning, but I like my hair better without this gel.
"
"
It’s the best. My waves are really beautiful curls. I’m hair inept to. I can’t style it but loook I didn’t even try and it looks beautiful.
"
"
The product is amazing.  I have a lot of skepticism when it comes to buying products for my hair.  I used to just let it hair dry, but it would turn out extremely frizzy and corse.  This product was reccommended to me by my roommate and also one of my other friends who have curly hair and I was very impressed.  Not only does it make my hair feel silky smooth it also makes my hair smell amazing afterwards.
"
"
Makes my hard feel really dirty and rough if I use just this product, so I mix with the curling cream from DevaCurl.
"
"
Ok, so I was cautiously optimistic about this product due to past disappointments with other curl defining products. But boy, I'm glad I took the chance and ordered this, because it's amazing! I have frizzy/wavy hair that tries to curl, but never succeeds. I followed the instructions closely, applied the gel and waited for my hair to dry. After it dried, it was CRUNCHY. I was a little worried, but I flipped my hair and gently tussled it and re-scrunched it. When I flipped upright, there was no more crunch and my hair had beautiful volume!!I'm sold!!
"
"
My favorite gel from the DevaCurl line -- this one has a stronger hold than other gels, which I need for my hair type. I keep this bad boy in the shower and apply right after. Having the pump is so helpful. The price is right on -- if you use this stuff as much as I do, it's definitely worth it (and a better deal money-wise) to get the big one!
"
"
I was overly excited to try out this product, but I'm pretty disappointed with how this made my hair feel. After applying to my hair, I noticed that it made my hair feel dry and brittle. I tried using after a leave-in conditioning cream which helped a lot, but I'm still disappointed with how it turned out. Not to mention, my curls weren't as coily and bouncy as promised.
"
"
This is the hair product I have been looking for!  I have hair type 2b or 2c (not quite sure), and I don't see myself ever using anything else.  It has a strong hold but does not make my hair look ""crunchy.""  The hold lasts all day!  Truly a blessing to have found this. The search is over lol
"
"
I love this gel it’s so amazing for my 2C hair and I love the scent. It’s not too heavy and just the right hold. The only problem it’s kind of expensive and that the product came open and spilled :(
"
"
Just got this today. Took a shower and styled my hair with this gel. Was very skeptical,  but followed the suggested use instructions and I am SO pleased. I have curly hair ,but had it cut short (stacked bob) for the winter because I blow it out. Suffice to say, I've been wearing my hair up for months because my hair is in that awkward growth stage. NOT ANYMORE. Threw out the mousse I just bought. .
"
"
Wonderful light styling gel for curly hair.  Almost weightless and it holds all day. It also last forever. I don't use the full amount rec commended because a little goes a long way for me. My stylist told me to use a huge amount and it totally weighed my hair down, not necessary.  Great product!!
"
"
Love the bottle it comes in, makes it easy to use and get more without getting gel all over the bottle. I used to have to use mousse and hairspray and my curly hair would be crunchy. Now I only use this product and my curls are soft. LOVE!
"
"
My curly hair has never looked better than when I started using DevaCurl products.  Their Ultra Defining Gel gives me smooth defined curls without frizz. No flakey residue or hard crunch. Of all the hair products for curls I've used this is the brand that delivers.
"
"
the only gel I will ever use again. Holds curl without being too stiff or sticky. I have naturally wavy, long, thick hair. I'll put some of this on in the morning while my hair is wet, and it dries nice and curly without being stiff. I love it.
"
"
I didn't think I'd like this gel because I have thick hair and normally use a very thick gel to control it.  This gel is runny, but I LOVE IT!  It has great hold that lasts!
"
"
I love my ultra defining gel. It gives my curls this amazing shape and shine without having to layer on product after product. The gel does leave a cast sometimes, but honestly it's nothing a good shake doesn't get rid of.The reason I took two stars away though was because of the packaging. I receive the product without any sort of attempt at sealing the top and about a third of the product was wasted in the box.
"
"
I wanted to like this.  But it makes my hair feel dirty and coated.  I eventually had to just tie my hair back because I couldnt take it anymore.  Im normally a big fan of DevaCurl products.  Now Im stuck with a huge bottle of it.
"
"
This did nothing more for my hair than the $3 herbal essence mousse. Not worth the price. Dried crunchy not soft.
"
"
Terrible. Feels like glue in your hair after it dries (and I use the recommended amount or less). It also leaves my hair super oily much sooner than any product I've ever used. Disappointing as the curl reviving spray is awesome.
"
"
I thought it would have a lot more holding power. It doesn't have e much, but smells nice.
"
"
For the first couple of days, it was fantastic. But after about a week, my hair is more frizzy and dry than it's ever been. My hair also had more tangles in it now than I could have ever imagined. Although I have never used this product before now, I do not believe that I received a real product.
"
"
I have been experiencing a lot of hair loss. It’s noticeable in my temples, and overall very thin. And now I see on the news that Deva Curl could be causing the problem and there is a class action law suit out against them.  I will stop using this product immediately!
"
"
Makes my girlfriends natural curls even better. She swears by this stuff. She got a better deal ordering some kind of duo pack.

Have been buying from this seller for awhile. Great price! I have been using devacurl now for 2 years and LOVE IT! I have always struggled with my curls but not with this. If it is your first time using this brand be patient! Your hair has to adjust to not having alcohol and harsh ingredients. It'll be frizzy for about a week or two but then will be awesome!

"
This is the best stuff for my wavy curly hair.  I have had such issues like frizz and unruly not able to keep calm hair all my life.  Devacurl and DevaCare have saved my hair and now I even get my hair cut by a Devagirl!!  NO more blow dryers or straighteners for me.  I get compliments all the time about my copper red curly hair and I love it!! especially since I am a since confident woman.  Thank you DEVACURL
"
"
This is the best gel I've ever used for my curls. I use liberal amounts but it isn't heavy or sticky. Locks in a nice curl for the day.
"
"
As a curly-haired woman who's tried pretty much every product on the market (well, not quite) I can say this & DevaCurl No-Poo are my favorites.  I get lots of compliments on my hair, mainly from other curly-haired women.
"
"
Great gel but too heavy for my fine hair.  And I was nervous about all the bad press.  Sent it back.
"
"
I tried this based on a referral that I saw on a social media page.  It is good although I have tried products that I like better.  You must use it as it says to get the best results.  Do the whole scrunching thing...before (while hair is wet) and after (when hair is dry).  I do enjoy the look it gives....curls are definitely bouncy and non frizzy!
"
"
It's good for my frizz/curly hair- I think I used to much (only used it once) so the curls were way to stiff. I actually didn't think I used a lot.Next time will use even less and it may earn 4 stars because it does eliminate frizz and definitely defines curls. I have very long hair and used it after a towel dry. I

I used to have very curly hair, but I've noticed that as I've become older, my curls are becoming more flat.  I've tried so many products to get my curls to hold again but not make them crunchy.  This product creates the exact look that I have been aiming for.  Highly recommended!
"
"
I love this product! It literally changed the way I understand my hair.I love all the Deva Curl products but this gel is a must! I tend to bounce around with other curly girl hair products as far as shampoo/conditions and leave ins but I always come back to this get. I’m considering getting the arc Angel gel but I’m getting nervous about getting counterfeit product!
"
"
I love the whole DevaCurl line. I am so glad I was introduced to it. Nothing else makes my curls quite as nice.
"
"
I love this product! I have naturally curly hair and this product works well to stop frizz. I put a little bit in my hair right after a shower when my hair is still damp. My hair does not get crunchy or crispy but has nice, defined curls.
"
"
Great product for waves or curls to air dry; the instructions not only tell you how to apply the product, but what to do afterward to make sure your hair looks its best!
"
"
Love this. Defines the curls, smells fresh and great value. My go to.
"
"
I even got the bottle with new Design. It doesn't make my hair crunchy even when I use a lot of product. It gives a lot of body to my curls.
"
"
One of my favorite products, an absolute staple in my curly hair routine. I put this on straight out of the shower, ""plop"" my hair for about 30 minutes in a microfiber towel, then let the hair air-dry and shake off the cast. I follow it was a small amount of hydrating cream. Couldn't live without it!
"
"
This product is so great for my curly hair! It smells great and gives my curls good lasting shape!!
"
"
I live in south Florida and I really have tried it all when it comes to products to keep my hair curly, but have settled on crunchy because it's the lesser of two evils. But I have to say, this gel really does the job WITHOUT making my crispy. I put it on wet hair yesterday with no other product and I just need to touch it up today- better than most I've used. #worthit
"
"
It's not like the gel you get at Ulta. Left my hair frizzy and unpolished looking.
"
"
I absolutely love the way my hair looks with the DevaCurl Products. I have very thick hair with a little wavy and it gets very frizzy if I do not blow-dry and straighten (which takes an hour)...Now thanks to my new products I can have beautiful curly curly hair in a few minutes. Saves me soooo much time and I love these products.
"
"
I have been using this Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel for years, won't try another! I have curly hair and it is an amazing product! It holds the curl structure with definition but without a hard or crunchy feel or look. It ""locks on"" to the hair when wet, but dissipates as it dries, helping the curl well defined. If you do happen to apply too much and it does feel hard or crunchy, it is easily corrected just by touching, pinching, our pulling the curl down.  If you want less hold, they have a regular gel as well.
"
"
Curly haired daughter requested as Christmas gift for herself
"
"
Based on the reviews I was hoping this would work better with my hair. Instead, it just makes my hair sticky/stiff regardless of how much or little I use. Doesn't really define the curls more than anything I can buy at the store either.
"
"
My hair is fine and wavy. This devacurl product weighs down my hair. Kinky curly knot today curling custard is stronger, although it leaves more residue. Still looking for the perfect product!
"
"
This is very stiff and does not control frizz for my hair as well as Ouidad.
"
"
It's so hard to find a gel for curly hair that isnt too heavy or sticky....this is IT. Smells amazing and works wonderfully. I'm never changing gel again!
"
"
I love this product! It took me a few tries to get it exactly right but ultimately once you follow the instructions to the letter you get great results!! I love my hair after I use this product and there is still a bit of curl left even after I sleep.
"
"
DO NOT buy this off of Amazon. I have used this exact product for years and it’s the only product I’ll use. I decided to be cheap and try it off of amazon and it’s absolutely fake. It made my hair feel crunchy, flaky and almost chalk like. It’s not the real stuff. Save yourself and get it right from Devacurl or Ulta.
"
"
Received product timely but shipping box was completely open and damaged and so was the product container. The lid was missing and more than half the product was missing and all over the box. It was a huge mess.  That’s pretty disappointing to pay for 32 oz but only receive about 10 oz. I love the product though!
"
"
Product has changed since I started using Deva many years ago.  Scalp is scaly and itchy, hair is limp.  I have stopped using all Deva products.
"
"
Best product! My curls are defined but not crunchy.
"
"
Wow, I’m very dissatisfied in this product. Love devacurl’s supercream and thought this would help keep my curls in check but no. Great price on amazon which why I’m giving it 2 stars but the product is not worth the price.
"
"
This is a great price for a real DevaCurl product, but they sent the wrong version. I ordered the Ultra Defining Gel, but received the Light Defining Gel. Only I didn’t realize until I already opened the bottle so didn’t feel right sending it back. The packaging is very similar and clearly I made the same mistake. So I will order again once I go through the wrong bottle, because it is a great price and the real deal, but not happy with my fluffy “lightly defined” waves.
"
"
I didn't want to buy yet another hair product so I didn't purchase right away even though the reviews were good.  This stuff is fabulous.  It makes your hair not frizzy and beautiful texture.  Get it and try it don't wait!!!
"
"
Love this product for my curly hair! I had been purchasing this at another Beauty store for more money, and I was a bit skeptical after reading other reviews that I would be getting a fake product. I purchased from Beauty It Is and my product is the real deal! I will purchase again!
"
"
On the more expensive side but works well in my hair with the deva curl conditioner and coconut stretcher. A little goes a long way and curls are best solidified when hair is wet
"
"
This is the worst hair product that I’ve ever used. It makes my hair super dry, frizzy, sticky and strangled. My curls don’t even look like curls! It is impossible to give them any shape. I made the biggest mistake ordering this product because I’ve been hearing so many great things about DevaCurl, but it is such a waste of money!!
"
"
Small bottle for the price. Also, Something in this product made my scalp itch and brake out in hives that extended to my forehead and eyelids
"
"
It holds a curl without any stickiness. My hair looks natural.
"
"
I have a mixture of 3c/4a hair and this works WONDERFULLY. My curls transform with this gel. I use it on my daughter as well who has 3a/3b hair and it works well for her too. I use it sparingly because it’s expensive lol and a little goes a long way.
"
"
Tried a sample and love it.  Glad I could find it here.
"
"
I wanted to like this but it dries my hair out so badly. It worked great the first couple of uses but it then started drying my hair out and caused dandruff and flakes. This picture was when I first tried it. It looks great but when you feel it, you can tell my hair is thirsty.
"
"
The only gel I will use on my naturally curly hair. When applied after my leave-in conditioner and left to sit overnight, I wake up with the most beautiful curls! I do use it up quickly, but I also have lots of hair. I can't recommend this product enough! I've tried so many different products, but I keep coming back to this one. You won't regret purchasing it!
"
"
The smell is too strong and is an overkill. However, it doesn't stay on hair for that long. The gel itself works great, it's not oily and the hair is not greasy. Love my curls!
"
"
“Provides” more curl, but makes my hair look grassy and dry.
"
"
Light & curl defining!!  Not a heavy gel whatsoever so your hair wont feel weighed down!!  Best curl product I've found yet!!  I'll never use anything else ...
"
"
Love this product. It helps curls to stay curly but without making hair hard crunchy.
"
"
Works well but it's a process.  I highly recommend watching tutorials on you tube because this is like regular gel.
"
"
My hair loves it! Once it dries and you rescrunch your hair all the crunch is gone and soft curls remain.
"
"
Super soft feeling and holds curls well
"
"
This is a nice light product that gives my curls shape with no frizz and rates well on EWG.
"
"
Don’t like the smell but does the job wish it would help more with the frizz. Gives me soft curls I also use curl cream before the gel
"
"
I love the gel. It works wonders on my crazy curly hair.
"
"
I love love this gel!!Amazing for curly girls!
"
"
It's a good product, but it doesn't work with my hair. It makes my hair feel like I haven't washed it for a week.
"
"
I decided to try this product and so far it has been my favorite product to use ! Does not leave my hair sticky like the others I have tried .
"
"
My daughter (age 26) swears by this stuff for her long curly hair, and got me and my sisters (old ladies with short wavy hair) using it, too. Gives your hair body without making it stiff.
"
"
first time trying devacurl and I like it. I will still probably stick to my more inexpensive products but it was great to try. I have a lot of hair and felt like I had to use a lot of the product in order to reach all my hair.
"
"
It doesn't have a super strong hold, but it smells delicious.
"
"
I love this product for my curly hair and the smell is amazing. The transaction was also very easy and it shipped on time.
"
"
My beautiful naturally curly headed wife loves this entire product line.
"
"
This product is not for me.
"
"
Be careful! The product I received was not Deva Curl. I have been using Deva Curl for years and just love it. I bought it on Amazon because it was cheaper. I had to throw my whole bottle away because my hair went frizzy as soon as it dried. Be very cautious when buying this product on Amazon!
"
"
For tamed unfrizzy curls. Works best right after shower
"
"
I have curly, fine, thick hair and I'm always looking for the right styling product. I usually use Aveda but they're on the expensive side so I wanted to try something new. This product has a nice light floral citrus scent, not overbearing at all. It's a little gunky going on, but after my hair dries there aren't any really stiff parts and the curl is good. It seems to last most of the day, too.
"
"
I have thick, frizzy hair. 2C curls. I don't know if am applying it wrong or what, but it does not work for me, at all. I have to use it together with whats left of my Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner and it looks good. I was hoping to fully switch to DevaCurl but it looks like I won't be.
"
"
Love this gel! It’s my all time go to!
"
"
I bought this product after it was recommended on a YouTube video by mini_marley - I am trying to go natural and get back my natural curls. This product worked great. My curls stay, look heathy and are bouncy- just the look I was going for.  Keeps my curls nice and shiny
"
"
Love love love this gel. My hair isn’t stiff after I use it. A small but goes such a long way. Smells like citrus but not too strong. Devacurl gel for me from now on.
"
"
Best product ever. I slept on my hair and woke up with my curls perfect.
"
"
I've just started using this product, I do use several of the other hair care products that they sell for curly hair. I've been dealing with my curly hair my whole life, and this is the first time that I get compliments on my hair. People ask me what products I use because my hair looks so pretty!These products have saved my life!
"
"
My bottle had a piece of tape holding the lid on the bottle. It was unscrewed a tiny bit and some hair gel had oozed out a tiny bit. The lid and the area surrounding the lid is now sticky. In the past I have received my bottle of gel and it was shrink wrapped and never had this situation.
"
"
Received my gel today.  The top was loose,  and it had leaked all over the package.  I lost a lot of the what was in the bottle.  I love the product,  but paid for a full container,  not one that is already empty to the packaging line.
"
"
Love it. So easy on the curls and not stiff at all.
"
"
Great tool, if you know how to work it.I have read a lot of negative reviews about this product and I get what they are saying but I am also wondering if they know what they are doing.Watch the videos on YouTube! This product performs perfectly as it is suppose to when used as directed. Apply liberally (use a lot!) to dripping wet hair and scrunch it through while your head is upside down. Scrunch as much water out while you are distributing it throughout your hair. Use a deva towel or soft tee shirt to scrunch more water out and then let it be. Air drying seems to provide the best 'cast' on my hair without any frizzies. Once it's crisp, scrunch the cast out. Shake you head upside down, side to side to loosen it all up. That's it. No stiff hair!My hair only needs a little refreshing mist the following day to look new. I only wash twice a week but rinse with the one conditioner every two to three days.  On those condition days I repeat the above process w/the gel.My curls range from s'wavy to Botticelli to corkscrew.

Hair started to fall out
"
"
Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel has been a lifesaver!!  My daughter has the most frizzy hair I have ever seen!  I have spent the last 6.5 years trying EVERYTHING!  Frizzease, Fruictise anti frizz serum and dozens more!  Nothing has come close to the result of this gel!  The price seems high, but when the bottle comes you quickly realize just how much gel you are getting for the price (32 oz). Now, for the results: after washing my daughters hair, I put 2 pumps of this gel into my hand and gently massage it into her damp hair. Once dry, her hair is frizz-less (happy dance!) and looks fantastically SOFT (not crunchy and stiff like other gels). I HIGHLY recommend this gel to anyone who has long been searching for the best anit-frizz gel or anyone who recently started looking.  Look no further, this is for you! I will be purchasing this again and again and again in the future (but not for a while…this bottle LASTS!!!)!
"
"
I love this product, especially on very humid days.  It keeps my curls from getting frizzy and doesn't leave them feeling crunchy.
"
"
I think it depends on the humidity how well this does in your hair. I come from a really dry place, so it just makes it more crunchy. Even when I fluff it out, during the day I will find stiff curls. When I have gone to more humid places, it works much better and isn't so stiff.
"
"
It arrived on time and in not leaking...which has been a problem with other companies. The gel works great for curly hair.
"
"
I've been trying new hair gels to fgind the perfect one for my curls. I really like this one. It's taken me a bit to figure out the right amounts and the right way to use it, but I'm really liking it now. I'm thinking about giving up my Miss Jessie's gel I used to use.
"
"
It really helps my curls to come out...
"
"
I'm throwing this out.  It made my hair stiff, stringy and dull.  There are much better products out there for defining your curls.
"
"
AMAZING!!!! my daughter is half-African American. She has my hair texture (Fine hair) but my husband's curls. Her hair is the typical ""gets frizzy"" curls. This product makes her curls look AMAZING. I get so many compliments.
"
"
I originally used the light gel and wasn't a big fan.  I could never get the ""cast"" that keeps my coarse thick wavy/curly hair in shape all day.  This product did all the things that I wanted it to do.  For me, it works best by using a lot of product on sopping wet hair.  I diffuse and then scrunch out the cast one my hair is fully dry.  I'm finally weaning myself off of my hairspray addiction with the hold this product gives.
"
"
Devacurl products are one of my favorites. I have naturally curly hair and finding products to help me control my hair is very difficult. I like this gel because it is never stiff or sticky and still allows my hair to move! It does define, but it seems to do so without the look of tightly wound curls or ones that look overly coifed. So, what I end up with is soft curls that are manageable! HIghly recommend.
"
"
I personally did not like the effect. It made my 2c_3a hair very much crunchy. My hair felt somehwat sticky as well. My hair did not feel smooth after using this.
"
"
Didn't give the volume I was looking for!
"
"
Works great for curly hair.
"
"
I love this stuff!  Use it each time I wash my hair.  I have recommended it to others.  The product came in earlier than expected.
"
"
I like the product I just wish they would send it to  you witrh a pump that works!
"
"
Great product
"
"
love this stuff! I've struggled with mouse being too flexible and gel being too crunchy for decades! It's a miracle product for curly hair!
"
"
I normally have wavy to straight-ish hair. Very little goes a long way. I dab pea sized amounts onto my fingertips and run through my damp hair after getting out of the shower in the morning. Then scrunch and let air dry. My hair is soft, wavy and frizz free by the time I get to work.
"
"
I love my curls after applying this gel.
"
"
Devacurl  ultra defining hair gel is perfect for my hair. It boost my curls and makes them look so shiny and healthy. Can’t live without it
"
"
I have been using this product line for years. I have fine, long color treated hair that has big loose wavy natural curls-only if I work very hard to get them. This is my favorite gel in their line and it gives my hair a great hold and shape without being crunchy.
"
"
It was pretty good but not worth the money. I have used better for cheaper. I do love that it is silicone free. Just not enough control for me
"
"
I use the devacurl styling cream and I bought this to try it out with the other. I haven't found it necessary for my hair. I haven't used it by itself without the cream but I wasn't super impressed.
"
"
Great price for this product. The only thing wrong was the top had loosened on the gel and some had spilled out. So it was quite a mess. Thankfully it was in a bag of it's own.
"
"
Doesn't work as well as the regular formula. Not worth the purchase. Buy it at Ulta, more expensive, but better quality. It's almost as if it is not the ultra.
"
"
Arrived promptly as promised. No problems in shipping.  Couldn't wait to try this out.  Where have you been all of my life? This gel will be a new staple for my thick curly hair. It is very light and as others have said in their reviews. It is not sticky at all. Leaves me with soft curls when applied to wet hair. I don't need a lot of this gel for the soft curls, but if I wanted hard curls then I'd have to slather this on. Since there are other far cheaper products that will do that, I don't recommend it for that purpose. Use if you want natural looking, soft, bouncy curls. The product does not fix my dryness and I still need to use an oil, but its great for a wash and go. Enjoy!
"
"
rip off. i mistakenly purchased this in a rush without reading carefully. it’s a tiny travel bottle for $10?!?!?
"
"
Recommended by my salon stylist. Better value than retail.
"
"
Best
"
"
Defines hair good went from wavy to spirals but if you use too much you can feel it when you touch your hair
"
"
Good product, but doesn’t hold all day and I have to use heat to set it, which I hate. When I let it air dry it doesn’t hold hardly at all, but it does OK when I use the hair dryer. But heat dries out my hair, so I feel like it’s not worth it. It’s ok, but kind of expensive and there are cheaper and better options out there.
"
"
My hair loves this stuff. My hair feels to hydrated, and it really fights the frizz in my curls. I use on wet hair in the shower, and air dry.
"
"
Feels like it weighs down my hair... Nice definition though, just not for me with how wet it looks throughout the day. It's not crunchy though.
"
"
I absolutely love this product!!! I have 3c/4a hair and I was a little worried about ordering this product since I’ve never used it before and I am so glad I did! My curls are so defined and the best part is that my hair is not crunchy after using it! By far the best product I own.
"
"
Excellent product. I always get disappointed by the hair products, but this one is really good. The smell is nice and it is easy to apply.
"
"
I have curly/straight African American hair.  This product worked well as long as my hair was short;  however it didn't curl my hair once  I let it grow out.  It did not add a stickiness nor did it dry my hair.  If I go short again, I'll use it.
"
"
This product dried my hair out and broke my hair to the root.  Very dissatisfied.  Wish I could get my money back.  When I realized what was causing my hair breakage it was too late to return.  I have many Devacurl products that I can no longer use.
"
"
Leaves hair a bit ""crunch,"" but casings break pretty easily.  Gels are not my preferred final product, but this one isn't bad.
"
"
I bought this product based on DevaCurls recommendation and my curls get stringy and flat. Does nothing for hold and my hair ends up feeling gross at the roots when used with their shampoo and conditioner
"
"
I love this styling cream. It is lightweight but holds my hair. I like the scent of it too.
"
"
Smells great, and leaves my curls bouncy without the sticky crunchy feel. The gel was shipped with another item I ordered and was in a separate box to protect the product from leaking, or bottle breaking. Value for the product is excellent.Thank you,Andi S
"
"
These products made me lose my hair by chunks !!! In less than 2 months I was bald on the sides . The amount of hair that I was a ball as big as the palm of my hand
"
"
This gel smells like skittles! It has a thick consistency that dissolves into wet hair and leaves a nice, touchable hold. It doesn't leave the hair feeling heavy or weighed down. However, if you have a curl pattern that is very weak or prone to frizzing, this gel might not be thick/dense enough to clump and define your curls. It also doesn't do much for shrinkage. I prefer this gel for days when I want really big, voluminous first day hair or for smoothing and redefining second day hair.
"
"
Yes, I have received the REAL DEAL- THIS IS NOT A FAKE! Great price, as it's $46.00 at Sephora and EVERYWHERE else. Wonderful buy!!!
"
"
I love this gel. I return to it often and find that it gives me consistent results but it is pricey. Cheaper gels don't work as well which is why I come back to it when my hair is being difficult.
"
"
This gel smells nice and has a nice texture to it. It feels very light and the hands. The problem is it does absolutely nothing to control for is on my hair. My hair looks like a frizzy mess. I guess I'll have to go back to using stronger hold gels.
"
"
Defines curls nicely. I have 3c hair.
"
"
Yes
"
"
I have 2C/3A curls and found this gives me a lot of fly away/ frizz.  Felt like a residue and heavy all day long.  I got much better control and definition with Ouidad Climate Control.  I will use up my supply and go back to Ouidad.  Ouidad is non sticky/crunchy and weightless.
"
"
Maybe my hair is just too stubborn, but this gel seemed to do nothing for my hair. It just added a lot of product to my hair and made it heavy. I'll try it a few more times, but I think I'll have to find another product.
"
"
Great product. Love the way it defines my daughter's curls. And you can Spritz water on it the next morning and they appear to cling back up. Will be purchasing it again
"
"
I have used this for so long on my fine curly hair and love the definition I get!  I wish I would have thought to order this on Amazon sooner, so much cheaper!!
"
"
I've been using the DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel for about a year now. It has a great hold in my hair, and my curls look amazing for days. I also like this gel because it doesn't leave my hair all crunchy...it softens up the more you touch it. It might be a bit more expensive than other gels out there, but I'm going to stick with it because it's working for my hair.
"
"
This product is changing my daughters hair. I made her stop using it and have read that diva curl is making hair fall out. Can I send the products back to you?
"
"
It doesn't help on keeping defined curls
"
"
Love this stuff!! Fun, wavy hair!
"
"
I have thick wavy hair and find it hard to buy products that don't weigh my hair down.  this is great without making it crunchy or heavy and it also smells great, very clean smelling.
"
"
This gel is really great. It holds well with no crunch and doesn't dry out your hair! I follow the curly girl method from Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey and my hair is the best is ever been I get comments on it almost every day. I have ash blonde hair which I think is considered 3a. This isn't the only thing I use to style my hair but definitely does is job for the gel step. I only wish they made a less scented version as it smells very  fruity and flowery but if that doesn't bother you then you will like this.**This is now several months later and I have come full circle. The only thing that bothers me about the gel is the strong scent which, though this probably won't be an issue for most people, I am just used to using unscented products. In any case, after I ran out the last time I tried several unscented gels and ""lived"" with them for a while, then I tried the Deva Curl coconut Supercream but all that did was ""grease up"" my hair a bit (though not actually greasy, is like ""lotion"" in my hair which made it not dry all day and gave a bit of a wet effect). I also had used coconut oil in my hair (not the kind you eat but a kind that is for your hair and has a very sticky consistency) and for the first day it looks beautiful, my curls are super defined and no frizz, but then the second day I don't know what to do with it as either have to put more coconut oil in, or cleanse my hair every day. So I finally re-bought the deva curl gel yesterday and used it today and I have SO many complements. I conditioned my hair with the Deva Curl One Condition and rinsed out about half of it. Then, in the shower, I scrunched in the gel and kept scrunching till I got as much water out as I could. Then I scrunched out the rest of the water (that I could) with a t-shirt and let it air dry after that. It is such a perfect balance. The hold is great but doesn't weigh down your hair AT ALL. My curls are fluffy and soft, not crunchy at all but also virtually NO frizz. I think I am committed for life. Deva Curl, if you came out with lighter smelling one I would probably buy a lifetime supply, but for now I will have to put up with the smell as literally nothing else has worked. Buy this gel.
"
"
love devacurl... perfect hold, not crunchy
"
"
I have naturally curly/frizzy hair.  I really love this product because I can wash my hair, apply the gel, let it air dry (do not use a brush on hair) only finger comb....and it looks great!  It has only taken me 63 years to find a product I like.  Now instead of hating my curls....I'm loving them.
"
"
Doesnt work well and left my hair ao sticky and stiff had to jump back in shower ro re wash my hair because it left it feeling in manageable
"
"
Works well with my medium curly hair!  Tried many products and this gel, used after my leave-in conditioner, works great!
"
"
The product is OK but the packaging was not. It was inside a plastic bag but product had leaked out into the bag. Quite the mess.
"
"
No buildup, leaves my hair feeling light and doesn't feel like a gel at all, but smooths like one. I will definitely purchase this again.

This is my favorite curly hair gel. I have very fine hair and it doesn't weigh it down or look like I have too much product in my hair. I live in a humid climate and it helps with frizz control also
"
"
Stuff worked well but it leaked all over and I lost a good amount due to the shipping.
"
"
I liked this better when i had longer hair- i recently cut it (just past shoulders) and now its too heavy for my hair- i switched back to the light defining gel.  I have fine, wavy hair and when it was 3/4 down my back the ultra gel made perfect curls with no frizz! I paired it with a small amount of the deva conditioner (i used it as a leave-in).
"
"
Not sure, but his leaves my hair stiff and sticky.
"
"
The Devacurl products are expensive but well worth it for curly hair. I usually use it 2-3 times a week and it lasts a long time and keeps my curls looking great and soft. I also use some hairspray with it to make my style last longer.
"
"
My hair is frizzy and this product takes the frizz out
"
"
 Love the product, but not satisfied with the packaging. It was a leaky mess when I opened it.
"
"
No sticky feeling on your hands afterwards. Wow! My curls were popping after I used this and followed the directions on the bottle. I know this is a little pricey compared to grocery store products, but this is not like what you would buy there.
"
"
excellent
"
"
This product didn't work for me, but it may just be my hair type. My hair is naturally wavy/curly, but not tight curls. I was hoping it would give my curls more definition, and it did not. For now I'll stick with sea salt gel, because that works better for me.
"
"
Nice
"
"
I love this stuff! It works amazing on my hair. I have naturally wavy hair and it makes it really curly and adds definition! Will buy again!
"
"
Perfect to tame curly hair. Lightweight and smells great
"
"
I have always had wavy hair.  By using this product I was able to get it really curly and it would hold all day.  I could also keep it wavy and it would hold all day as well.  Does not leave your hair with that crunchy feel
"
"
So Deva Curl products are amazing in my book. I use this on my type 3c hair. I have lots of spirals mixed with some waves, hair that frizzes easily, and it appears thick but is actually not. I use this exactly as instructed. Apply after shower using a head upside down, scrunching motion. Wrap in a microfiber towel. Allow to dry in the towel about 30 minutes and then air dry a little followed by a diffuser. While I'm diffusing I shake off the cast! The cruncy stiff feeling is gone and I'm left with soft spirals. I also use a small amount of non foaming mousse before wrapping in the towel. And after diffusing I'll use a light anti frizz cream. But this gel is the key for me!
"
"
Left my hair dry even on wash day. Watch the YouTube videos on this product and believe the bad hair ones.
"
"
THIS SMELLS GREAT!! And it does wonders for frizz and curls
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
I've been using this stuff for years, it's the only product that holds my curls softly without crunch.  Love it!
"
"
Recommended to me by my stylist and I love the way she does my hair so I had to purchase it
"
"
This is a great product, even for white-girl hair. I have the type of hair that is frizzy if left on it's own and straightening it takes so much time in the morning. With this product and a sea salt spray I can now scrunch it and let it dry and go. I love it.
"
"
Works great
"
"
This isn't what I expected. It is definitely a gel but it doesn't do what I'd like for my 4 year old's very curl/frizzy hair. Maybe because she's 4.
"
"
The cast is perfect! It lasts me three days with lavender root refresher!
"
"
Really love this so much!! I had tried another gels, mousses, and creams. But This is it! It Works fantastic, and my hair had a perm, I'm not naturally curly hair!
"
"
Does not keep my curls together . Very disappointed. First time this happened,first time buying 32oz bottle
"
"
Great hold and scent (I have 3B hair with lots of breakage in the front of my hair)
"
"
I got a small sample of this gel from Sephora and I love it so I went ahead and bought the 32oz bottle here, big mistake it dries my hair out and it makes it really crunchy, I don't like it at all, I think Is not  the same formula compare to the one I got at Sephora I want a refund.
"
"
This is the best gel for curly hair! I have tried others, but this one is the best.
"
"
not exactly sure whay happened here.... I was very disappointed to get this product and have a huge mess in my hands just to use it
"
"
This gel works better than the crème for me. It has more control and prevents frizz better. My hair is softer and I feel like I am having less breakage. However, it is good at controlling frizz, not great and it still has some crunchiness to my hair.
"
"
Speedy delivery. Good product. Makes my wavy curls pretty. Smells good too.
"
"
Seriously if you have naturally curly hair and are frustrated with trying to find the right product for your hair, give this a whirl. It doesn't make your hair 'crunchy' but actually has made mine look healthier than with other gels. It smells good, too. I've recommend it to several curly haired friends.
"
"
Great buy, I’m mixed and it keeps my hair from frizzing
"
"
Striped my hair and smells weird
"
"
This stuff is absolutely fantastic. It does make your hair a little crunchy though, so I use it as more of an over night thing and then put another product in my hair to combat the frizz that was produced over night. It really brings out your curls, love it! Very satisfied!
"
"
Hands down the best curling gel I have ever used.  After my hair dries, I break the cast and my hair feels wonderful while retaining the curl.  I typically use just a little hairspray after.  Cannot rave enough about how much I love this product.
"
"
Been using the same 5-star product for years and this is NOT it. Doesn't work and doesn't smell like my last bottle. Also arrived open and leaking all over box.
"
"
Love the Deva Curl line.  However not sure if I will be purchasing this again.  Dont really notice any typical gel hold or like crispiness.  Not that I like my hair to be crispy but I need something to tame the frizz a little better.
"
"
Loved the product makes my curls even curlier! As for the delivery, the first time I ordered, the gel spilled in the bag like some of the other reviews. But the second time it was in tact. Happy with this product.
"
"
This was the first time I used Alexa to order. Alexa said it was time to order more Deva Curl conditioner. I said okay to order it, and I got Deva Curl gel instead. I like the product, but it's not what I ordered.
"
"
Love this gel!  I accidentally purchased a different version (deva care gel) and can't wait to use it up to go back to this version. Smells great to. I use as part of the Deva curl system with No poo and One condition and thrilled with the results (and all the compliments)!
"
"
need to get the whole line ladies!! i have been using it for about a year now (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam, Mister right, and soommmmee times  the set above! It is A MUST TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED! Lucky me my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free, you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!
"
"
This product works great for curly hair especially if you use as directed - leave a little bit of Devacurl conditioner in your hair, your hair should be soaking wet, flip your head over, scrunch a few pumps of gel into the ends and roots of your hair, and gently dry with a soft t-shirt.
"
"
It doesn't feel heavy on the hair and smells great, I don't really have something bad to say about it.
"
"
Great product for anyone with curly hair! I will buy again!
"
"
I am very disappointed with this product. I had less curl with this. My curls look better with mousse.
"
"
This product came at a great price and quickly!! I love Deva curl products and I tell everyone I know that loves my curls!
"
"
This is a great gel - leaves no residue, does not make my hair crunch, and really gives me nice tight curls.  I bought this thinking I wanted the extra hold, but I think I prefer a lighter hold for the curls I want (they used the lighter hold gel during my devacurl haircut...I now realize). However, great product, great company
"
"
I've tried EVERYTHING for my long curls, and this is BY FAR my favorite. I hate the feel of gel, but this doesn't give that crunchy texture. Highly recommend.
"
"
great
"
"
Disappointed in this product, have bought several small bottles and loved it. Decided to buy the large one and it’s not the same gel as the other bottles. Takes me twice as much product and still don’t get the same results.
"
"
My hair felt like straw with this on it.  Didn't control while still feeling touchable.  Felt like hair was more straw and stringy looking.
"
"
DevaCurl is one of the very very few gels that don't weigh my hair down. Creams just don't work for me. It has an ultra strong hold without making my hair heavier. I have thick hair and a little goes a long way. It's pricey, but worth it!
"
"
The product smells awesome! Tried other products but this one is perfect for my hair type.
"
"
This gel is so amazing. I purchased the whole line of Diva curl to get the best results. This gel leaves my curls defined and frizz free all day. I have received so many compliments on my hair. I would definetly recommend this product to all curly hairs out there.
"
"
This isn’t the real ultra defining gel. It’s leaving build up on my hair making it look dull and feel icky.
"
"
I really wanted this to work, but it didn't for me.  I used this several times as instructed.  It did reduce frizziness, and my hair was a bit wavier, but my hair had no shine and was dry and somewhat stiff - even after breaking the 'cast.'.  I even tried it again using a leave-in conditioner first, then Devacurl, but it didn't help.  I can't use something that dries out my hair even more.  After 3 uses, i just threw it out.  Wasted money.
"
"
Good hold, but made my hair feel dried out and crunchy.  Fruity scent smelled like a truck stop bathroom air freshener.  Overall pretty disappointed.  Not the product for me!
"
"
If I could give 6 stars I would.  Finally I have found the holy grail for my hair. Frizz no more .  I use it on wet and dry hair.  Follow directions on their video. The less you touch your hair the better results. Thank you.
"
"
My hairdresser suggested that I get it (and order it through Amazon). It really helps me organize the curl in my hair when I wash it! It isn't sticky or heavy and is mildly scented.
"
"
This makes my hair gorgeous. The only thing I would change is making it fragrance free. My hair smells strongly of grape candy, but I tolerate it because...I guess I'm a bit vain!
"
"
to define curls in my grandaughter hair
"
"
I have very fine thin curly hair. This word really got on my hair and lasted all day.
"
"
Great product- great price
"
"
Works good, still  haven't found my holy grail
"
"
This is the perfect light gel for curly hair.  It defines curls, but it never leaves you hair feeling crispy.  This large size is awesome because it comes with a pump for dispensing.
"
"
I love this product. So amazing. I have thick full wavy/curly hair. In the summer it is out of control, super frizzy. This product help me tame the summer frizz. Great hold, great curl definition, excellent frizz control.Hair feels soft and natural.
"
"
Brings out the spiral curls without that awful crunchy, wet look.  Works even in humidity.  I have color-treated, thick, coarse hair and had previously used Aveda and Bb and Phyllo.  I've switched to Devacurl permanently!  Great fragrance.  Not sticky.  It works for air drying, but I get better results with a diffuser.
"
"
I received this item damaged, the gel was leaking into the box and put out a strong aroma of the gel product. Very messy when I opened it up.
"
"
Made my hair really dry and brittle feeling. Cannot believe I spent so much on this product. Defiantly not worth it.
"
"
Nice defining gel, it works great and it doesn't form dandruff
"
"
I have so much curly hair. My stylist recommended this and it's great.  It holds my frizzy curls without making them crunchy. Finally!  A product that can do both!
"
"
Love how this gel holds my curls in place but doesn't feel crunchy. I love devacurl products for my curly hair.
"
"
simply one of the best curly hair products I Have ever used. My curls are springy and bouncy and not weighed down or stiff.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Normally, Gel doesn't work too well with my hair because it's so thick. This Gel works perfectly (I am African-American) and gives me a good hold when I need it to and it doesn't clump up in my hair.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Arg. I so wish I could give this 5 stars because it:-creates amazing curls without even having to defuse my hair, and-makes it possible to wear my hair 2-3 days by just touching it up with a little bit more of this productUnfortunately:-like other reviewers said, it makes my hair very dry(hint: do NOT run fingers through hair after it is dry - you shouldn't with curly hair anyways, but there's an added frizz nightmare with this product)That being said, I think the dryness is still way less damaging than using a defuser every day, and this product makes defusing unnecessary.
"
"
I know the quality of the product from my haircut at devachan but what is up with this busted bottle that isn't even full? So expensive for not even a full bottle... Feeling like this is a black market version of the real thing.
"
"
Works great for my son's curly curly hair.
"
"
Calling all Curly Girls... this gel will change those unruly noodles.
"
"
My hair is soft and curly after using this product.  Curls have perked up!  I absolutely love this product.  I definitely recommend it.
"
"
love this stuff! it's always cheaper to get it through Amazon than stores that sell it.
"
"
I *love* this product and have ordered it a number of times. But, it arrived with a cracked a broken pump, and I'm so annoyed to have to deal with a return.
"
"
It made my hair a little ""crunchy"" but helped hold down the frizz.
"
"
Great product for ALL curly peeps!  Holds my curls in place for at least 3 days!  To freshen up, I simply mist water to bed-head, fluff hair and DONE!
"
"
Simply the best product for people with curly hair.  It is easy to use, it smells great, it doesn't flake, it's not crunchy or stiff.  It leaves your hair super soft and curly and holds all day!
"
"
I have long, curly hair and I live in the south. Suffice it to say, it's hard to have a good hair day. Devacurl is fantastic! It counteracts the nasty frizz and helps keep my curls intact, even on hot and humid days.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Purchased this after I read some great reviews. It worked well, but I've found other products that work and smell better (I LOVE Not Your Mother's Kinky Moves).
"
"
This was recommended to me by a hairdresser friend.  I was reluctant to use it because of the price.  I have super thick porous hair that tends to soak up product so I end up using a lot.  Most of the time I get so-so results.But...I really love this product in combination with the Devacurl Styling Cream.  I have found that the Styling Cream and Ultra Defining gel work super together.My routine for my porous thick sometimes frizzy spiral curls is simple:* Wash with cheap shampoo and conditioner.* Use a cheap leave in conditioner on my hair to comb out the tangles* Then I apply Ulta Argan oil to the ends to keep them from drying out as I have Ombre highlights in my hair.* Devacurl Ultra gel and run it thru my hair* I use about 15 squirts of the styling cream and work it in to my hair* Scrutch it and let it air dry for about 15 minutes to let the curls ""set""If I use the products together I can survive the 100% Houston humidity with style.I highly recommend you buy this with the Devacurl Styling cream and use this together for great results.  Besides, you can always send them back with Amazon Prime if you don't like them.  (Shout out to Amazon Prime too!)
"
"
Amazing product works perfect with my naturally curly hair
"
"
This product is the one product that has been great for my 3B/C hair. I used to have to use a mousse and a gel. Now I fingercomb a generous amount through my hair after applying a leave-in.
"
"
It leaves my curls crunchy for the first day although it says it won't... which I don't like. Second day hair is usually fabulous though!
"
"
This is a great gel and it doesn't leave that dark and sticky look in your hair after you dry it a bit.
"
"
Love this works amazing and my curls look so good and not crunchy sticky feeling
"
"
I'm lazy about styling my kinda naturally wavy hair and have scrunched and hair sprayed for many years when I'm too lazy to blow dry it straight, but frankly my hair just looked messy most of the time.  A friend who is a stylist always has beautifully defined SOFT curly hair, and I asked her so many times, ""Do you curl your hair?""  She just said ""no"" almost as many times but finally spilled her secret : Deva!  I bought it a couple of months ago and have never looked back.  I never blow dry my hair anymore and get CONSTANT enquiries and compliments about my curls when in public. Read the reviews about how to use it or look it up on You Tube to get the most bang for your buck, because if you're gonna towel dry your hair, you may as well just save your money  This is seriously life changing stuff!  Just find our how to use it correctly, and you'll thank your lucky stars that you found this product.  I've recommended it to so many people, I should be paid!  But really, I'm just happy to give people some hope!  I just used the no-poo and conditioner for the first time today & my results were even better, but if you can't afford it, just try the Gel.
"
"
Make my natural curls wonderful in the summer heat
"
"
The best!
"
"
I love this product. I was unsure, but very happy with the results. My hair was soft, and the fragrance was very pretty. It's priced higher in other places, but very reasonable on Amazon!! I will re-order!!
"
"
Gives your hair body & keeps it in place.
"
"
I like the product but sometime I feel it's a little too stiff. I have been diluting with water and for me that seems to work better. I am also going to try the Light gel.
"
"
love it
"
"
Great product.
"
"
I love this product since it keeps the hold on my curly hair but it doesn't make my hair hard. My hair is rarely frizzy when I use this. Great purchase.
"
"
Best product for my hair
"
"
Es el mejor gel para pelo rizado. Es ligero, y huele delicioso!! Además esta presentación es perfecta porque rinde y rinde
"
"
Ordered this after some great reviews. But the package itself was damaged and the product has spilled over .Would be updating the review on the product itself after using it
"
"
This gel work great with my curly and the cast I get works perfect and it crunches out easily.
"
"
Amazing product. Best I've ever used for my frizz/curls
"
"
I have dry, extremely tight curls and am prone to frizziness. This along with Shea moisture smoothie leave in, my curls dry so shiny and lock in the moisture. The only thing is that it can cause your hair to be crunchy, but just play with it a little and it becomes soft again. Love this product!
"
"
I read that this was one of the best gels, thus I bought so much. It doesn't hold up for truly curly hair. Around 2 pm I start to see frizz and my hair feels like straw if you don't wash it every night.
"
"
Love the way this product defines my curls. My hair stays bouncy and soft.
"
"
I've been using this gel as part of my routine after getting a deva cut. But, I found that it was making my hair very frizzy. I'm sure it works better for some people but personally it doesn't for me.
"
"
I love the product but it is a little too expensive
"
"
I am still somewhat new to this product, but on the second day after washing, it usually looks the best if I use it sparingly.  Sometimes it's not enough, and other times it feels like there is buildup, but my hair is pretty long, wavy, and sort of fine.  It's still pretty great stuff that doesn't get crispy.
"
"
Good gel at a good price.
"
"
If you're looking for hold without crunch for your naturally curly hair, then look no further! I use it with a diffuser and love the results!
"
"
Love the product, hated the packagingI was naive and thought after reading those reviews where their packaging was a mess and leaking all in the plastic bag. Oh was I wrong 🙄
"
"
Good
"
"
Love this product.. It has become the only styling product I use for my naturally curly hair.
"
"
Love how it makes the perfect curl and keeps it there all day!
"
"
This is my favorite hair gel for my ultra curly hair! Great stuff!
"
"
This has an odd hold  - I can't figure out the right usage to get the look I want. When I use a semi-decent amount its too stiff and crunchy. When I use less, it looks as if I had not even used the product. I went back to my Tresemme curl spray...
"
"
I'm wearing my curls down on day 2, after sleeping with my hair in a bun, and they still look great. Best curly product ever.
"
"
This works well on s'wavy hair.  It separates, defines and holds the waves in place.  It's a bit crunchy and wet looking, but if you use it on dripping wet hair, then scrunch your hair once it's completely dry, it softens up.  I haven't found anything better.
"
"
Love Devacurl!! Works great on my fine hair!
"
"
I like that it keeps the frizzy at bay and makes my curls look good
"
"
This product didn't work for me like I had hoped it would. It still left my hair super frizzy.
"
"
Hold my curls very good
"
"
Such a great product, wish it wasn't so expensive, but hey, I'm worth it!
"
"
Can't say enough about this product. keeps my curls under control in the florida humidity.
"
"
So glad youlls is a reasonable price and is the real Deva curl too
"
"
Box came all torn up but this is the only product that I trust in my hair
"
"
Omg! The best curl gel I've every come across. Try it out and I know you'll love it.
"
"
Really nice gel. I'm a black male with 4c hair and this holds my hair pretty well. I wish it held it a tad bit harder but it's chill.
"
"
Defines curls without making it hard
"
"
Best thing I've found to keep the frizz down without the hard crunchies!
"
"
Got this for my crazy curly hair. It is AMAZING! Will continue to purchase! Controls frizz and forms beautiful curls without giving your hair the horrible gel crunch other products do.
"
"
The smell is amazing! Other than that, there was no benefit to my hair. The product did not hold my curl pattern, and made my hair dry and brittle. I washed it out as soon as I got back home.
"
"
makes my hair too crunchy and dry. It holds the curl, but at the expense of stiffness and making my hair feel like hay after a day.
"
"
Love it. Use it all the time for big curls.
"
"
A gel that helps hold the curl without hardning your hair.
"
"
It smells great and it helps control my curls a little, but I don't think I can use this product alone for my frizz control.
"
"
When I received the package there was gel all over the bottle and the pump was already in the bottle and does not work.
"
"
I have used this product two times but after all the recent publicity, I am afraid to keep using it. What are my options for return?
"
"
Perfect product for creating natural wave and curl in my hair.  I absolutely love this gel as it doesn't make it crunchy.
"
"
I have wavy/curly hair.. it decides what it wants to do everyday. This Gel deff helps me create more ringlets in my hair. love it.
"
"
Nothing reallly special about this product. A little pricey for just regular gel.
"
"
Super good!! Smells amazing and really defines your curls
"
"
Love this gel, no flakes and keeps hair in place! Better then any Paul michelle stuff I've ever used!
"
"
Works absolutely fabulous for sculpting beautiful curls.
"
"
Great stuff
"
"
Using this with the Loo Poo and Conditioner. Works GREAT I have fine hair, s-wave to spiral curl hair. Love, love, love this line.
"
"
Helps my curls stay in place and controls the frizz I normally get.
"
"
good
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE these products.  I previously had the light defining gel but I think I like this one better.
"
"
This stuff is great! Used it for years. Best I've ever found for curly hair.
"
"
I love the product, except for it didn't come sealed with tape around it. When I opened the package the lid was completely unscrewed and the gel had spilled everywhere.
"
"
Amazingly effective. My curls tend to get very wild with the humidity but this product left my hair feeling soft and manageable.
"
"
For some reason, this product did not work for my curly hair. After using for two days my hair became very dry.
"
"
Definitely helps with frizz and you do not need much
"
"
Sorry to say it didn't work for me.  I use other products from the same brand.
"
"
I love what this does for my curls.  I use it apply it as the bottle suggests (in wet hair, flip head and scrunch, rescrunch when dry) and it works amazing.  My curls are soft and stand up to the toughest humidity!
"
"
Very disappointed in the product for the amount of money charged. No moisture at all added to the hair to the point my hair became extremely dry from the usage of all the Deva products..
"
"
Perfect for curly ladies that don't like the feel of hair full of product but still wanna get rid of that frizz. Would totally buy again
"
"
Gel drys out my hair a lot.  You have to mix it with other products to keep it moisturized but when  you do the gel may become flaky , so it  defeats the point.  Stopped using it overall.
"
"
Good light gel that does not make my hair crunchy, but strong enough to hold my curl. Initially I was wary of the DevaCurl line and wondering if it is worth the hype. So far I have been very happy with the results and this gel is a large part of the reason why. Easy to use and it leaves me with all day curl/frizz free definition.
"
"
El.mejir producto q he usado
"
"
loved how this made my natural curls. super soft and no crunch.
"
"
I have type 3c curls. This is the only gel that keeps my curls in check over the course of several days in between shampooing. A little goes a long way. It's the only gel I'll buy from now on.
"
"
This is a great product that was recommended to me by my stylist. I scrunch it into my wet hair and either diffuse it with the hair dryer or wrap my hair in a t-shirt to dry (called plopping). It leaves my curls soft, not crunchy.
"
"
Devacurl has really improved the ingredients in this gel! It used to have several really harmful ingredients, but they have done away with all but the synthetic fragrance, so I'm much happier with it. In addition, the fragrance that is in there now is not nearly as strong as it used to be (it used to almost give me a headache every time I got it out). As far as how the gel works, it still works great, just like it did before. You have to use a LOT of this (a whole palmful) for each use or it won't have the good effects it's supposed to, so the bottle can be emptied pretty quickly, and that hasn't changed either, but as long as your hair is well-moisturized or you use a leave-in conditioner first, it makes nicely-formed curls that are soft once it dries and you scrunch all the curls out. If you don't use enough gel, you'll likely have frizz and stringy, poorly-formed curls. Also, if your hair isn't well-moisturized before application, it will likely make your hair feel product-y and stiff like straw.
"
"
I heard so much good things about this gel but when I put it on it gave me a lot of knots this is not for curly hair is more like for soft wavy curls I will never purchase it again I’ll stick to my hair glaze
"
"
This is a good hair gel for curly hair types.  The label describes it as being an ""ultra hold"" gel, but for me it is more a light/moderate hold.  It is not sticky or heavy and does not make my hair ""crunchy"" or stiff or look like plastic.  It has a pleasant, mild fragrance which I find slightly fresh and slightly fruity...do I detect peaches?  Not sure, very subtle.  Does not compete with my perfumes.  The pump top of the 32 oz. size is very convenient and I plan to purchase this size with pump top from now on.  This is the best hair gel I have found.  Sometimes I wish it had a little more hold.  For instance, I never have to scrunch my ends once dry to soften the hold as one usually does with curly gelled hair.  And some of my top curlier locks can look a little frizzy sometimes.  But I have very long 3a/3b hair (below bra strap, long layers) and live in Florida where it is usually very hot and humid, so maybe I am expecting too much.  I would absolutely recommend this hair gel.
"
"
From this purchase I am considering getting other Devacurl products. It works great for curly hair and I didn't even use much of the product. I'm totally sold. If you haven't already, check out the Curly Girl Handbook.

If you are looking for definition, this is your product.  makes your curls shiny and holds them in place.
"
"
Does what it says. Didn't work for me.
"
"
OK product. It did not work on my hair.
"
"
The top was completely unscrewed when I received it. A good portion of the product had completely spilled out of the bottle.  Unfortunate, as I this product is pretty pricey.
"
"
Great product.  No crispiness.  Pairs well with coconut oil.
"
"
I’ve ordered several times as this is my favorite gel. However this time, the bottle was not properly sealed before shipping and most of the gel had spilled into the plastic packaging.
"
"
Did nothing for my curls :/. I have heard so many great things about this product from friends.
"
"
Best product I have found for curly- wavy hair. Doesn't crunch!!
"
"
this product is so trash and a waste of my money. it leaves my hair looking so bad and frizzy
"
"
I love this product! As a working Mom I love that I can put this product in my hair and give it a quick blow dry and it looks like I spent much more time (than  5 minutes) on my hair!
"
"
My go-to product. A better deal to buy the large size online than regular size in store all the time.
"
"
Not the best defining gel for my curls
"
"
great product
"
"
Defines my curls without the crunch. It's not sticky and didn't flake.
"
"
The Ultra Defining Gel works much better than the Light sample I received. If you put too much of the UD gel in, your hair will be crunchy, so a dime to a quarter sized amount is perfect. I should have this bottle for a while. Very pleased with this product.
"
"
The item arrived damaged. The pump for the bottle does not work properly (it doesn't pump) which is extremely inconvenient when needing to use the item.
"
"
I love this product. It makes my curly hair look awesome. It keeps the curl without making your hair look hard or crunchy. It is well worth the price
"
"
Item arrived broken and covered in its own contents. Pump is completely useless. Terribly packaged.
"
"
This product work fantastic in terms of really defining my curls but the alcohol content makes my hair very brittle.  Not great for long term use but is great for occasional use
"
"
It really doesnt make your hair crunchy if you use it right before you get out the shower and I think that's the best part
"
"
You might want to get the big bottle though. I use this gel quickly. It has good hold, but blends into your hair nicely and isn't too crunchy.
"
"
Works great to keep my curls unfrizzyAnd in place with a soft uncrunchy hold
"
"
My hair tends to be dry since I started letting the grey grow out so I was very happy to find this productIt left my hair refreshed
"
"
I've been using this product for 20 years.  Won't ever stop using it.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
not a strong hold but its okay.
"
"
Great product with out the feel of a gel hold
"
"
The hair gel works great! This is the first time I have bought it online and when it arrive about half the bottle had spilled in the box.
"
"
I think I have tried everything in the stores to help with frizz and curls. I love this products it does what it says it will do. Purchasing again for sure.
"
"
This stuff dried my hair out so bad and made my scalp itch something terrible!  I will never buy this again.
"
"
Best defining gel ever.  It works wonders for my thick, 3b hair.
"
"
Smells amazing but flakes really bad on my hair! It makes me look like I have really bad dandruff!
"
"
This is the best gel for my naturally curly (botticelli), long, thick hair that I have found.  Prior to discovering the Deva product line, I was using Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl.  It defined my curls as well as Deva Ultra Defining Gel, but it was super crunchy, and I couldn't make my hair look good the next day without washing it.  I then ordered the Deva travel kit which came with the Deva Light Defining Gel.  I liked it, but the hold wasn't quite strong enough.  So I ordered the Deva Ultra Defining Gel.  Both Deva Gels do not make my hair crunchy.  And what is really great about them is I can spray my hair with boiled water with lavender essential oil the next day and the curls come back to life without having to wash my hair and reapply the gel.  Also, I like the scent of the Deva products a lot better than the Redken Curvaceous scent.
"
"
Been using this for years!
"
"
I was expecting great results from this product because I love their shampoo.  This gel is extremely drying my hair became frizzy and hung with no bounce.  I have used it for just two days and won't use it again, it's just not worth it.
"
"
Smells great, but made my hair sticky and gross. I wold not reccomend this product.
"
"
I have 3b/3c hair and this works great, I would suggest using it with a leave in for extra moisture. The only bad thing about this is the price is too high
"
"
Love love love love this product. It's so amazing. I was originally using the light defining gel, but my hair's grown 4+ inches in the last year, so it was time to step up the hold with the ultra. Would highly recommend.
"
"
Great product for curly hair! You won't find better than the Deva Curl line.
"
"
works ok. Need to practice on my daughters hair more.
"
"
My hair absolutely loves this stuff. It doesn't leave any hard, crunchy and sticky curls---it is just right!
"
"
Devacurl gel is great for all hair types. It is a great water based gel when you just want to wash your hair and you're on the go, awesome wet look.
"
"
Love love love love deva curl. And this product especially since it does not make my hair crunchy. Leaves my curls soft and bouncy
"
"
I like it for my hair 2CBut after your hair dry, you have to shake your hair.
"
"
Like
"
"
It's ok... but much cheaper gels give you much better hold than this Devacurl gel.  Not worth the money.
"
"
The only gel I've ever found that holds up to the humidity and gives me great looking curls.
"
"
Works well, and I love the shake out without it being too crunchy or flakey.
"
"
I love this gel. If helps to keep the curls very well defined for days and it looks very natural. Just make sure you wear just enough of it because then the gel would leave your hair with some white spots.
"
"
Bottle wasn’t closed and product leaked into the plastic bag surrounding the bottle
"
"
I use this with Deva Curl Set It Free Moisture Lock.  I prefer the gel on days with lower humidity here in Miami.  If I use it on days with high humidity I tend to frizz up too quick.  The curls stay soft and crunch free.
"
"
Not too good of product
"
"
I would not recommend this product at all. It does not define your curls or hydrates. It leaves your hair dry. Don't waste your money...
"
"
Stopped using.found it to dry out my hair
"
"
Love how my curls look!
"
"
Muy buen producto , me gusta porque define mis rizos.
"
"
Absolutely love this product . The only thing I was not happy about is that I thought I was getting two ultra defining gels and I only got one and one light
"
"
Super shiny firm but non flaky hold
"
"
Doesn't come full. Looks like it was used because there's product missing. Would not recommend buying from here
"
"
Didn't work on my hair, but I don't think it's a bad product, just not compatible with my hair
"
"
Best gel ever, will be buying again.
"
"
This gel leaves my 2C/3A hair soft and smelling great! Has a medium hold and fights frizz very well. It’s now my go-to!
"
"
Tried every other product out their to try to define and revive my curls. Only one that has worked !
"
"
It is a light gel that defines the curls nicely!
"
"
This magical gel keeps my curls from getting frizzy and me from going completely insane
"
"
This product def still makes your hair crunchy.. unfortunately. Doesn't really smell like anything.. probably won't buy again.
"
"
Didn't work for my natural curly hair. Shipping took a long time.
"
"
African American with 4a/4b hair...i have found that the devacurl products that i use (ultra defining gel, coconut styling cream, daily conditioner, and heaven in hair conditioner) all work really well to define and hydrate my curls.  i was the typical product junkie (african american women tend to spend the MOST money on finding products to help tame our hair) trying anything and everything to help my natural hair state.  my hair is close to waist-length when straight, and none of the products that i found on the shelves worked to give me the type of curl definition i was looking for.  my closest option was a twist out.  when i went for an appointment with my local deva-stylist, the products listed above were the products she used (also used no-poo which i haven't purchased), and i was amazed at them all.  i've used the gel without the cream... works great alone or in conjunction.  i'm an advocate for their products for sure.
"
"
Smells so good and holds all day. I love this product!
"
"
I read a article that this was the best curl gel ever.  I found it to be ok, nothing great. Still looking for some magic for my curly hair!
"
"
I prefer the Arc Angel, but this is nice too. All the Deva Curl products that I have tried are great!
"
"
First off, I should say that this gel is amazing and a curly-haired person's savior. You need to apply it carefully to wet hair, so here's my process.1) Rinse out your conditioner upside down in the shower. Keep yourself that way through Steps 1 - 4 .2) Turn off shower. Add in a little conditioner if you need to, although I never do. Do NOT rake through hair, just gently pat some onto your ends. Let hair drip a bit while you towel off, still upside down.3) Apply gel by gliding it over your hair. I work from my neck down to my ends, trying to gently glide some over individual pieces, roots to ends. I also put some along my pointer fingers and gently swipe some in near my roots where I'd wear a headband and near the back crown of my head. Then I cover my palms and fingers in gel and scrunch my hair to strain out water finally. Stop as soon as you stop getting significant amounts of water out, and try to accomplish this in as few scrunches as possible.4) Grab an old t-shirt or Devacurl microfiber towel and scrunch hair super carefully in sections to dry it. I hold a section in a scrunch until I can feel water coming through the towel, then move on. You want to touch your hair as little as possible. I do each section 2 times.5) Flip over and apply clips at roots if you need more volume while drying.EDIT: As soon as you get your hair dried, make sure to scrunch it out carefully! Otherwise hair will be crispy and weird. Getting it super crispy is important in protecting your hair while it dries though.The upside down bit can be avoided if you get good volume up top, but my hair gets weighed down by water easily so I stay upside down until it's lighter. My hair would also clump into one giant curl if I let it, so keeping upside down lets it break up a bit more. I think this product smells nice, provides a good long hold on your curls, and isn't drying compared to a lot of gels. If you find it to be drying, re-examine your conditioning process.Why am I giving a 2 out of 5 when this product deserves a 5? This seller sent me a bottle with a majorly cracked pump, which probably did NOT happen through shipping because it was well-packed. My old pump also doesn't work as a replacement despite my best efforts, so I'm having to carefully pour it out of the bottle. Not happy about that, having a pump on a bottle of this size is necessary, especially when upside down with wet, gel-y hands.
"
"
This product only fulfilled some of its promises. It did bring out my curls, give me volume and leave it without crispiness but it did nothing for my frizziness. I found if I use hair spray with it when it's still damp it helps with that.
"
"
CURLY HAIRED GIRLS REJOICE! Miracle product and it smells AMAZING!
"
"
Love this line, but this is the first gel in MANY that never fail to give me full, bouncy, gorgeous curls without feeling sticky or gooey.
"
"
Very Happy with this purchase
"
"
there is a slight crunch to it, but thats good for your hair! I love this product!
"
"
Excellent product, economical price.  I have used Deva products for the last 6 years and have always been satisfied with their performance.
"
"
I love this lightweight gel, it is great holding and hard to even know it is there. I use it all the time.
"
"
If you use sparingly, nice texture and hold without getting crunchy or flakey.
"
"
I love be this gel.
"
"
it really really does justice for my curls
"
"
Love this stuff & will purchase again!
"
"
I love this stuff. My hair is naturally wavy, but it really kicks it up a notch with Deva in it. I love that it isn't sticky or stiff, and if My hair gets droopy I just wet my hands and scrunch again.
"
"
Beautifully forms natural curls , amazing !
"
"
I will never need to buy another styling product for me hair again.  The search is over.
"
"
Great scent, controls my curls without a stiff hold and doesn't flake!
"
"
Love this product. A bit expensive but so worth the price
"
"
I cannot say enough about this product! My hair has never looked as good. My curls are soft and tighter than ever before! Not to mention it lasts all day without getting frizzy, I haven't used a hair tie in weeks.I use the conditioner every day like shampoo, making sure to scrub my scalp and really work it into the ends. I then rinse, but not completely. I use the ""no-poo"" once a week. I use the gel when my hair is sopping wet and then again after it has hair dried a bit, just to make sure the ends are covered.I will never go back to another product. Nor will I ever have to waste money again for products that don't work.
"
"
Today I received wron qty. A package with only two bottles and the order said lot of 4. I’m waiting for any response or my money back.
"
"
Leaves my hair feeling like crunchy straw
"
"
I love this gel! It gives my hair all day curls and bounce,but not siff or sticky. It also handles frizz even in high humidity. It holds up to a comb.
"
"
Keeps my hair from frizzing (except under super high humidity) and keeps the natural curls in all day.
"
"
I have always used the Light Defining Gel so decided to try the Ultra.  I like it, but do not think my curls are quite as shiny after using it in the shower after washing my hair.  I use it now between shampoos if my curls need a little pick me up.
"
"
I love this product, but the pump was broken when it arrived.
"
"
Use Devacurl shampoo and conditioner, this works great on my curly hair. I have to use more to get more defined ringlets, but love the pump
"
"
I bought this previously at my salon, but when they stopped carrying it, I went to Amazon. I have ordered twice. The price is right and the 2 day Prime shipping is ideal
"
"
Poor product performance as advertised, not designed for could or coarse hair. Probably work for wavy hair
"
"
Weigh my hair down and made it feel really brittle
"
"
My wife used this on vacation at a cousins house.  This works awesome and doesn't leave the hair crusty or frizzy.
"
"
I'm not so sure this is that much better than cheapo hair gel honestly.
"
"
Five stars!
"
"
I really like the fragrance. It goes on without a sticky feeling. After scrunching hair, curls are bouncy and fluffy. It doesn't weigh my hair down. It seems as if I didn't put any gel in it at all.
"
"
I love this stuff! And my Devachan certified stylist shared with me a secret about why the Deva line works so well. It's made with a water soluble base instead of an oil base. Not only does that mean it holds moisture better, but it also means I don't break out any more! I have cystic acne, so trying to find a hair product that didn't make me break out was nearly impossible. I also had breakouts on my scalp. I've used only Deva products for about a year now, and have had no major breakouts like I used to! Yay for Deva!
"
"
Great product to help manage my curls and reduce frizz!
"
"
This is the BEST product I’ve found for my hair. My curls look amazing. I highly suggest this product.
"
"
Defined curls
"
"
Perfect for frizz resolution!  Definitely especially my curls and keeps frizz away!
"
"
The hold is alright but it leaves a residue that stays on your hair and hands all day. much prefer the creams from this brand.
"
"
Left my hair crunchy
"
"
It does define my curls as it said without te stiffness gel/mousse create.  I tried MANY products  and so far this works the best!  Not to mention,  hopefully what it says is true as far as free of parabens  & other crap in most products!
"
"
If gel is what you want then this is the product for your curly hair.
"
"
Perfect
"
"
Great
"
"
leaves my curly hair perfectly defined
"
"
I have 2b/2c hair.  I am always looking for ways to get more curl yet keep the frizz down.  I got this bottle thinking it would be amazing since it's Devacurl and I had been using the Curly Girl Method for several years.  I'm disappointed in the ingredients.  When you read the Curly Girl Handbook, there is a section talking about ingredients to stay away from.  This gel has some of those ingredients.  I do like the smell and I've been away from most chemical fragrances for awhile.  My main problem with this product is that I have to use so little that it barely does the job or else my curls go totally limp and flat.  For me, this would probably straighten my hair if I used it following the Curly Girl method amounts.  I'll continue to use it until the bottle is gone but if I can find a better, more natural, product then I'll switch in a heartbeat.
"
"
Horrible product with harsh chemicals that damages your hair! Stay away from it!
"
"
Disappointed. It works as well as any other gel I've tried, but by he end of day 1, my hair is much frizzier than it is with any other product.
"
"
This is the best but a little expensive.
"
"
This totally dries out my hair!!! I've had to start putting oil in my hair every night. I hate to throw out the rest of bottle because of the cost. I'm never buying this again.
"
"
This product is the absolute best product for naturally curly hair! Pairs Best with the Deva Care No Poo and Deva Care One Condition for color treated hair
"
"
The product damages my hair rather than healing it.
"
"
Love it! Works great on my curly hair!
"
"
This product makes my curls pop...go easy though hair can get crunchy if you over use
"
"
I am still trying to find the right product for my curly hair. I tried this out and I found it just okay. I really like the scent and it doesn't weigh my hair down like other gels. Yet my hair still gets frizzy.
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
Looks great most of the first day with nice curl definition. However, by end of day one, my hair starts to knot up in the back.  Day two it's impossible.  My hair feels sticky and matted even when using detangle spray. Overpriced for the results.
"
"
I really like this product because it controls my frizz and really defines my curls with a small amount.
"
"
My gel arrived with a loose cap and had leaked all over the bottle. Very disappointing for such an expensive product!
"
"
Love the product but the packaging was not great, some of the product was missing and leaking out of bottle as top wasn't closed tight
"
"
My favorite product for curly hair. No crunch, no frizz, and the curl holds!
"
"
I love this stuff, I love the way my curls look.
"
"
Works great for wavy hair.
"
"
My hair is not too thick and not too thin and is Curley.  I use this product after I wash with a No Poo product.  After I wash and towel dry my just past shoulder length hair I scrunch in a nice size dollop of this product.  Once my hair completely finishes drying my curls are nice a defined and shiny!
"
"
Half of it had leaked out in the box the lid was not properly tightened.
"
"
The ultra defining gel worked awesome on my hair. My curls came out way less frizzy!
"
"
Devacurl is the best .
"
"
I've been using DevaCurl products for several years and I got this as an add on on a recent purchase.  Think it is now my favorite product in the line.  I have a ton of very curly hair (type 3b if you know about the naturally curly scale) but it is also very fine so can be difficult to control.  I use this in combination with the DevaCurl Styling cream and my hear looks great.  Once my hair is almost dry, I run my fingers through it and my curls remain very defined without being crunchy or stiff (though if that is the way you like them just don't touch your hair and they will stay that way).  Highly recommend any of the DevaCurl products to anyone with curly hair.
"
"
Strong hold.
"
"
I like it 👍🏻 Works.
"
"
should be Applied in combination of Other oily stuff
"
"
I like how it makes my hair feel and look! My hair is medium thickness and curl and the gel really enhances that!
"
"
just as expected. arrived promptly
"
"
I am a frequent purchaser of this product - it works well and is not too heavy for my type curly hair
"
"
Overall it’s pretty good the one thing I will say it was much smaller then expected
"
"
Not a huge fan of their gel products versus their creams. Just never was a gel girl.
"
"
Epic for curly hair! I was able to get rid of two other products and just use this amazing gel. Goes on smooth, dries shiny and soft.
"
"
Amazing product.  My daughter has curly hair and this is perfect for her.  I’m happy with the price
"
"
Love the atuff.
"
"
I purchased this product from ASAP Beauty and it is the real thing (a lot of people have posted about counterfeit products)!! I really love this hair gel. I used it once when I was little after an aunt gifted it to me, but I didn't notice a huge difference. This time, I followed all the steps the Deva Curl method recommends and I have had great results. I live in Houston, TX so the humidity just kills my very curly hair. I noticed a huge difference in my hair after using the Deva Curl No-Poo and One Condition with this gel. I have varying curl patterns in my hair with a massive chunk in the back that's just frizz with no curls. With these products, I notice my curl pattern re-emerging in that area, plus it doesn't take days for my hair to start looking good again after a wash like I've experienced with other hair products. I pair this gel with As I Am Leave-in Conditioner (applied first) and my curls stay defined and don't get crunchy from the gel.
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  You have to try it!  My ""wavy"" hair is now beautiful soft corkscrew curls. I use it with these products Deva: DevaCurl One Conditioner + Low-Poo, 12 oz Combo.
"
"
I'm not normally a fan of gel, but I really like this. I use it with the coconut cream.
"
"
works great! love the whole line for my blonde fine wavy to curly hair.
"
"
Made my thick wavy hair into thick curly hair. I wish it helped more with frizz but overall a good buy.
"
"
Love curls. Helps curls. Curls, Curls, Curls.
"
"
great for the very hot and humid climate of Houston Texas
"
"
It left my hair looking frizzy half down; the top part was good but not as good as I expected
"
"
Great price for this product - thanks!
"
"
Just opened the package. See photo. Pump is broken and hair gel has leaked out of bottle in the plastic bag.
"
"
The item says it is for a firm hold but it didn’t work well for me. Almost like I had nothing on my hair.
"
"
Fantastic product!!!
"
"
Chemicals irritate my scalp.
"
"
Amazing product and smells so good!!
"
"
For the most part, it works but it's not a miracle. The original reviews make it sound that way. It works best right after you get out the shower. I didn't find it best to use overnight.
"
"
Love it. Doesn't make my curls crunchy, has a yummy scent to it, and helps my curls hold their shape all day. Its way better than the AnGel in my opinion. A lot goes a pretty long way, too.
"
"
I didn't use this as soon as it arrived.  I wish I had as it was clearly a little ""off"".  The smell is not quite right and simply isn't working as it normally does.  I can't find an option to message the seller at this point.  I will not be buying this again.
"
"
Great stuff!
"
"
It works great the only thing is when I got it in the mail, the gel was everywhere. Probably about a fourth of the bottle was all in the plastic wrap...
"
"
Perfect!  Fast shipping!
"
"
Perfect Price.  Just as expected
"
"
If you've had trouble taming your curls and their seemingly inevitable frizz - PLEASE give this product a try! It does not make my hair sticky or crunchy, and it leaves my curls feeling refreshed. Highly recommend!
"
"
Very drying on my locks. Need a leave in conditioner before each use.
"
"
Ordered this by accident, but love it!
"
"
5 stars
"
"
The product had opened and spilled everywhere when I opened the box. Better off getting it in person
"
"
My hair looks shinny and defined, it's an amazing product!
"
"
This is my first time trying any of the Devacurl products, and I have to say.... Where has this been my whole life!?!? This is a curly hair girl DREAM product! It's light, yet effective, I didn't have to cake the product on and yet got amazing results.
"
"
Smells great. Defines curls. But my hair is left feeling dry and rough. I finished the bottle but won't be purchasing again.
"
"
Really defines
"
"
Such an awesome product been using it for years. Can’t find it any cheaper than here.
"
"
I like how my hair looks with this product
"
"
GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING
"
"
really improves my less than perfect curls
"
"
Love it! Light weight,not sticky. Leaves my curls difined and bouncy.
"
"
Love the Devacurl products.  My hair is much healthier and curlier.
"
"
My daughter loved the results it gave her natural hair. I will be purchasing again.
"
"
Best hair care product for curly hair
"
"
This product actually works on my hair. It's been a while since something has worked great. Love it.
"
"
Great product...Recommended by my stylist
"
"
I love this product, but bottle was open and spilled in shipping box
"
"
I have thick hair and this is great for it. Looks moisturized all the time and it helps define my curls
"
"
I was hoping that this feel would help give me lots of definition as per the name, but it hasn't lived it to its standards. Good product, just don't expect crazy or ""ultra"" definition. Shipping was great. Well wrapped.
"
"
I love Devacurl products!  This gel was a great purchase to go with the cleanser and conditioner. I'm super happy, thank you!
"
"
I have tried a lot of hair gel. A lot. I found stuff that worked, and I thought it was great. On a whim I went to a local beauty store that was closing and bought this for half off.Whoa.I noticed a huge difference in my curls. The reviews were true. Why did I waste my money on crappy stuff when I could have bought Devacurl? Granted, it is more money, but its true you get what you pay for. I can't believe I haven't been using this stuff. Today when I was out and about  I had three people comment on my hair and how one thought it was ""beautiful.""  I'm keeping this product and I'm going to try the shampoo and conditioner as well.
"
"
I love this curl gel. It helps define my curls. It tends to dry slightly crunchy at first but softens as the day goes on.
"
"
Great hair product that work on fine hair!
"
"
The curl wasn't anything like promoted. Hair becomes very tangled as well.
"
"
Amazing! My hair is over dry, wavy and has limp curls. This does the job of giving my hair moisture and bounce to my long forgotten curls without the crunch
"
"
The defining gel made my curls softer and shiny without the frizz.
"
"
A gel light enough but also defining enough for my fine, curly hair.
"
"
Expensive, but it works great. (3a fine curls, using the CG method ;))
"
"
Like this better then the lighter gel if you want defined curls and doesn't dry wet. Use shampoo/conditioner with gel for best results.
"
"
I love deva curl products.  Brings out the natural curls and doesn't make your hair stiff and hard.  If you scrunch your hair after it's dry your curls will hold but they will also be soft.
"
"
LOVE DevaCurl products.  My curls are better than ever.
"
"
I love this so much I ordered 2. I have told several friends about the amazing curl you can get  even if you don't have curly hair. It leaves your hair very soft, no sticky feeling.
"
"
I have yet to find a product I like as much or works as well.  The only problem I have is I still end up with a layer of frizz no matter what I do or how much product I use.  It this would weigh that down it would 5 stars all the way.
"
"
Love the smell! Curl holds all day. The bottle/product will last me a year.
"
"
The bottle I received had the cap loose and spilled all over.
"
"
Love it!  Smells awesome...
"
"
Perfect for my curls. And smells pretty okay 💓
"
"
Too sticky

I swear by Deva products. Delivery was fast.
"
"
Amazing product, makes my limp curls much more defined. I'll be buying this regularly.
"
"
Product was opened and had covered 2 other items in the box
"
"
Great product - makes naturally curly hair look good, defining and no frizz.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Does miracles for my hair at a decent price
"
"
love it......makes my curls behave
"
"
Love this product!! Highly recommend this for anyone with curly hair
"
"
My favorite curling gel.  Works better than anything else I have ever used.
"
"
Love all of DevaCurl Products!
"
"
Made my hair hard.
"
"
Size was what I was expecting
"
"
great product and service
"
"
Fragrance is very strong and a bit unpleasant. Doesn't really reduce much of my frizz.
"
"
Regardless of amount, air dry or with blower my hair ends of frizzy by mid day.
"
"
Great for curls.
"
"
Very happy - wish Amazon would carry again for under $30 price point
"
"
I love this product! It’s the only thing that I have found that can keep my curls looking fresh with no frizz!
"
"
A nice, light feel and not sticky at all.  I wasn't a fan of the rest of the line, but I will continue to buy this gel!
"
"
It's a good product but unfortunately it left my hair very crunchy and dry. I don't like the crunchy look. Maybe it would work on someone with more curly hair. I'm more wavy curly
"
"
I got this because of the great reviews & I'm not sorry. In fact,  I don't think I'll ever buy another hair product again besides this.  I have natural curly hair that lost some of its curl after babies so I usually get it permed every 6 months.  It has been a year since my last perm and I don't plan on getting another one any time soon,  thanks to DevaCurl! It brought my hair back to life.  I get lots of comments on my curls now, as opposed to the days of perms and hair gel.  It gives my hair a more natural texture (no crunch) and my kids can't keep their hands off it when I leave it down. Also,  it smells great and lasts quite awhile.  I bought it 2 months ago  and still have 1/4 of a bottle left. I apply it to wet hair and scrunch, then scrunch with a cotton t-shirt to get the excess water out, then I scrunch in another coat of deva curl and let it air dry. Try it,  you'll never go back.  I mean it.
"
"
Wife loves it with her hard to manage hair this works great
"
"
I had read all the great reviews and wanted to try it for my wavy/curly hair. It definitely defines the curls, but not as much as it seemed to do for others and it did not help me as much as I had hoped with the frizziness I get when I let my hair air dry and be curly. The curls were definitely more defined than with any other curly hair products I have tried, but I ended up looking a little Shakira circa 2000 after she went through a wind tunnel. Not what I was going for. I will try it again and update my review if I get a different result.
"
"
Great value!
"
"
Doesn't get stiff and you don't need a lot. This size bottle should last 6 or more months. I have slightly wavy hair and it keeps the waves from going flat.
"
"
I find this really separates my curls - I mix it with a little water for a softer look - LOVE IT!!!
"
"
Makes my hair very dry. Stopped using it. I feel my hair lost all the moisture.
"
"
Works great, but you must put in in when your hair is pretty soaking wet. Would like a little stronger hold...I have frizzy/curly hair.
"
"
Well packaged but it spilled a little.
"
"
I got a perm- and I think it works really well for it! Without it my hair isn't as curly...
"
"
Love this product!!!!!
"
"
Made my hair very gummy. Felt heavey and dirtyMight be great product for Other types of hairNot degrading it just wasn't for my dooo lol
"
"
this defining gel is great it leaves my hair shiney and curly without putting more oil on my hair and i like that.
"
"
This product was extremely sticky and made my hair more tangle-prone. It did not define my waves and curls at all, and it smells horrible, a very saccharine synthetic odour.
"
"
Apply to wet hair and let dry and scrunch till you can't no mo! Curls definition  2 days straight  no frizz
"
"
Love my curls with Devacurl Gel.
"
"
globby and heavy makes hair frizzy
"
"
All I have to do is put it in my hair, let it air dry, then ""scrunch"" and go.
"
"
This is my go to gel, The entire line gives my wavy hair the best control and waves with out looking greasy.
"
"
Got this for my sister who has fine wavy hair. She gave it to me because it made her hair feel really dry. I've used it 3-4 times and it seems to be fine for my 2c wavy-Botticelli curls. Haven't experienced any dryness and it gives me tighter, defined curls, but will probably take turns between this and my Curl Keeper.
"
"
This works relatively well, and my hair looks pretty good.
"
"
My absolute favorite. I combine it with Tigi's Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier and it somehow manages to keep my hair nice and curly even in the Miami humidity.
"
"
Great hold but light, not sticky
"
"
Terrific product for bringing out the wave or curl in your hair!  I love it!  My hair has never been softer!!
"
"
Took a week to ship my order and I hate the product. I want a refund
"
"
The product doesn’t work on the hair like the original product did.
"
"
This stuff works really well.  I use it in conjunction with other Devacurl products and my hair has never looked better.
"
"
Absolutely love it!  Perfect.  I can't believe how great it works.
"
"
This holds difficult hair.
"
"
My hair stylist recommended this product and I absolutely love it. It feels light and like you putting no product on your hair, but controls naturally curly hair perfectly.
"
"
I can never do my hair without this gel! It keeps my curls in line without making them crunchy-feeling and hard
"
"
Unfortunately makes my hair brittle.
"
"
I love it
"
"
Feels like a heavy alcohol content. Doesn't leave my curls feeling soft or defined at all. Very disappointed. I was expecting a better product from Devacurl.
"
"
Works great. Holds curls softly.
"
"
I bought this because of a BuzzFeed compilation for curly hair recommending the product. I have wavy hair where it's layered & spiral curls where it's not. It helps control my frizz, & defines my curls. The only thing I don't care for is how it leaves my hair feeling coarse on days 2-3. Days 1-2 are great though.  It says to allow it to dry naturally then scrunch to break the cast, but I use a diffuser to partially dry my hair or it would never dry. It works really well this way too. I'll be buying this again
"
"
Best stuff for curly hair
"
"
Made my hair super oily and weighed it down.
"
"
For some reason the top came broken and some product spilled.
"
"
No gel cast leaves your hair soft
"
"
Great on my 3b curls, but I have to use a TON to get the hold I like. The smell is subtle and it doesn't dry my hair out too bad.
"
"
I heard so many  wonderful things about this line of product  that I decided to give it a try.... It’s AWFUL for my hair. This item is non refundable.
"
"
Deva curl has amazing products been using them now for about 15 months I would never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner again  no frizz always have beautiful curly hair
"
"
Gel is not sticky like typical gels. It makes your curls super defined and gorgeous.
"
"
Great
"
"
Just as described
"
"
Love this product...defines curls perfectly!
"
"
I love this product
"
"
Great stuff!  My curls have never looked, or felt better.  Seriously.
"
"
This product does leave your hair more dry.
"
"
I received my styling gel original product no bootleg.. I'm so excited to use
"
"
I love this product but it came and the pump was broken off so I can’t use the pump ☹️
"
"
I used to buy this at Harmon's until they stopped carrying the line. Since then, I was paying a fortune for it at Ulta. I am so happy that it is available at amazon at a slight discount.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Not the same as the product you purchase in the salon.
"
"
Keeps my curly, somewhat frizzy hair in the intended shape.
"
"
Great product
"
"
I usually buy it from beauty brands, but I saw the deal online and went for it. For some reason it doesn't seem to work the same.
"
"
This is the only line that will tame my hair, I love it!
"
"
great
"
"
great product for those of us with curly hair!
"
"
Magic is a bottle
"
"
I agree i love the product but the pump is impossible! Glad to see others had the same problem and I'm not crazy.
"
"
Love these products, the Ultra Defining gel holds a little better than the light defining gel for my thicker curls!
"
"
Leaves my hair curly but crunchy.
"
"
Love the definition it gives
"
"
Such a good product, gives great hold!
"
"
Loved this for my curls
"
"
Great hold.
"
"
Doesn't flake. Very light hold
"
"
Great product--very strong hold.
"
"
I really love this hair gel more than any other I have tried.  I have fairly curly hair normally, but this stuff makes it super curly every day w/o fail and never crunchy!  Plus it seems to be really gentle on my hair, probably due to having few harsh chemical ingredients.
"
"
I love DevaCurl. This gel is awesome and doesn't dry sticky or hard. My curls look great all day and feel great.
"
"
Curl without frizz or crunch.  Yay!!!!!
"
"
Perfect
"
"
YES! My waves needed this. Love this product
"
"
Great volume,  Great curls.
"
"
Daughter loves these products
"
"
A must for curly hair
"
"
Really works!!
"
"
I like the cream even better for my naturally curly hair.
"
"
Arrived quickly and product is amazing for defining and controlling natural curls, love!
"
"
The product was as advertised but it appeared to be a couple of ounces low in the container when it arrived. I do love Diva Hair Products!
"
"
Keeps curls springy. Won’t use anything else
"
"
Love these products. They make help define my curls, just love love love Devacurl! I like the way it liquifies in your hands.
"
"
Doesn't dry all 'crunchy' so that your hair looks wet and wind blown all day.  Great Gel!
"
"
The best gel for my curls. Soft and not crunchy
"
"
Lid wasn't screwed on all the way, leaked inside plastic bag. Good product,  shipping was on time.
"
"
I think this literally did nothing to my hair... and it smells like grape juice...
"
"
Did not work well for my curls, made them dry and looking dead
"
"
Great for curls
"
"
Works well but be advised it sets very crispy!
"
"
One of the best styling products for curly hair that is fine and frizzy in my opinion.  I can use only this as my styling product to create hydrated, frizz free bouncy curls that air dry perfectly.  My hair is 3b, fine and medium to thick fyi.  Be aware of your hair type because water based gels such as this may not work the same on all curls.  My only word of caution.  You will know right away if your hair likes this gel.  If it does, rejoice!  It also smells amazing.
"
"
In my opinion Light defining gel is better
"
"
This product is great, gives hair nice curl
"
"
No other curling gel can hold a candle to the DevaCurl defining gel; it really adds bounce without the heavy feel of an additive to the hair.  I get much better curls with this than any other gel.
"
"
My go to gel!
"
"
Bcs my hair is more curly..
"
"
This is ok, but I like Deva Curl Light Defining Gel Better.  This one tends to make my hair feel heavy and not as soft.
"
"
This curl gel is just ok. Makes my hair feel very dry.
"
"
I have been using this product and other Deva products for about two years. My curly hair has never felt healthier. It truly brings out the curl.  I am so glad to have found this product.  After washing my hair with Deva curl Lo Poo, I scrunch my hair with the deva towel or paper towels (yes, paper towels!).  Then scrunch some more, then when my hair is almost dry I apply the gel scrunching again.  You don't need a lot of gel.  Just follow the directions on bottle.  And buying it in the 32 oz size is such a bargain!  Much cheaper at Amazon than at my hair salon.  I do recommend using both products (shampoo and gel) for a better effect.
"
"
This gel did nothing for my hair, but make it frizz. I love DevaCurl's nopoo and conditioner, so I was really disappointed.
"
"
Perfect Curls
"
"
The gel works, but I've had similar results with cheaper brands.
"
"
Great for curly hair!
"
"
Best gel EVER-when diluted a bit with water!!!
"
"
I use this for my natural curly hair
"
"
Works great!!
"
"
Arrived well-packaged, and a great product for curly hair!
"
"
Garbage
"
"
I love all the DevaCurl products!!! This gel has great holding power and the shampoo and conditioner have done wonders for my hair!
"
"
Product made my hair hard and dry.
"
"
Curls my heavy hair. Good product!
"
"
Not worth the money.
"
"
Who has very curly hair. She liked it, but didn't like the build-up or smell. She may use it sparingly, not every day.
"
"
great
"
"
This product did not work for me.
"
"
Worked Ok recently ran out so had to buy from Salon and it was a lot thicker. May be watered down.
"
"
My husband ordered this product for me after I read some reviews on it which they turned out to be very helpful!!I have struggled with my unruly, dry, fine, frizzy hair for almost 40 years, since I was a teen ager. I have tried so many products but none of them worked like this one...... I was on the verge to shave my head, that is how frustrated I was, since I  also got tired of having to straighten it to look decent to myself.This product is amazing!! it defines the curls and gives hold and the hair never looks dry or frizzy. Since I have dry hair I do not like to wash it often and after a couple days, if you feel like reviving the curls, you can wet it a bit and it looks great again! Hope this helps someone like me :-)Thanks so much for whoever came up with this formula!!
"
"
This gel smells good and holds my curl while drying.  I love that the ingredients are good for your hairl.
"
"
Defines curls without being too crunchy. Only downside is that I need a ton of product. I have shoulder length hair and go through a 32oz bottle nearly every month.
"
"
I've dealt with my curls, or should I say my frizz, my whole life with very little luck. I would have the occasional, random ""good hair day"" but normally it was a daily fight to just not look like a dandilion gone to seed. 40 years of this and I had given up.Well, I started reading about the curly girl method and it made a lot of sense to me. So, after ""no-pooing"" for a few weeks I was amazed at how much better my hair looked and felt, but was still dealing with drug store products hoping to save a little $$. I finally bit the bullet and bought this gel and also the hair refresher mist. I AM IN LOVE WITH MY HAIR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. perfect ringlet curls, soft and shiny and they hold all day. Even on day 2 when I usually look like Medusa's sister, I spritz the refresher mist, scrunch and BOING go my ringlets again.If you're holding off due to the price, just stop and look at all the barely used curly products you have littering your bathroom and all the money you wasted. This stuff is worth every penny. And a little of this goes a long way.
"
"
Delivered without seal - I don't think this was a valid Deva product. Going to return.
"
"
I've just started using this..the first time I think I used too much and the second time, I used less and  it was still curly, I brushed it out and it had loads of body without me having to blow dry it..so far so good. I like the idea that I don't have to blow dry my hair for body..so far so good.
"
"
I'm not quite sure exactly how to use this product. I have medium length hair and a LOT of it. I usually apply this product when my hair is still wet/damp and flip my head upside down and scrunch the hair up toward the scalp and then blow dry it with a diffuser like that. When it's dry or almost dry I flip my head back up and have really pretty curls but they stay crunchy even when I try to scrunch it and uncast the curls. I've used the same method without blow drying, but I don't get the same curls, it's more wavy. Too much product can get make your hair look flakey.
"
"
first it took forever to even get the product. I tried it and it leaves my hair feeling stiff and dried out even after I try to scrunching it to unstiffen it
"
"
Love this product! It shipped fast!
"
"
This stuff is great! Definition for days with none of the weight. Literally, finish with a little coconut oil and you don't need to do your hair again for about a week. Walking outside in the South Florida heat, going to the beach (without getting hair wet, of course) & I'm still good to go. Smells awesome too. I do wish the ingredients were a bit more natural or even a touch organic, but SheaMoisture is sooo expensive! This is nearly half the cost per oz and at least its free of those silly-cones and parabens.
"
"
I have blonde, wavy hair and this works better than anything I've used before.
"
"
Disappointed. This product left my 3b high porosity hair dry and frizzy
"
"
Will always be my favorite gel! You don't need a lot, but if you're like me and like to overuse products it will not get hard and crunchy if a lot is used.
"
"
Best hair product I've ever bought, and my crazy curly hair has never looked better! I highly recommend this product.
"
"
This product worked great for my hair when it was short.
"
"
I really like the way it smells and that it's not sticky like other gels when I apply it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because when I flip my hair over and scrunch my hair and then try to dry it, it gets really matted after. Either it has a bad reaction to my hair or my hair isn't curly enough yet to get te results the curly girl method suggests. However, it does work if I just apply to my hair without flipping it over and scrunching. It does define my curls and gives my hair life all day.
"
"
Love the Deva Curl products.  I will never use anything else!!
"
"
Love it. Wish I could give it more stars!!!
"
"
Super, because it is truly, ultra, defining, curl gel!
"
"
Made my hair very stiff and frizzy.
"
"
I'm a curly girl Deva convert and good prices and good delivery made this a winner.
"
"
I was hoping this would magically make my hair super curly, but alas I just have to admit to myself that I have simply wavy hair. Does define the curls I have though and smells like rain
"
"
Great gel!!
"
"
Bueno
"
"
Will never use any other product for my hair. I absolutely love Deva Curl!!!!
"
"
It’s not that good.Did not do any difference!
"
"
this product is excellent for my very curly hair
"
"
Wonderful stuff ... not sticky or too heavy.My hair is thin AND fine and it brings out the curl without flattening, greasing or drying.LOVE!!!
"
"
It's decent but I'm not raving about it either. I'll probably go back to John Freida gel after this
"
"
Loved the product
"
"
I love this deva curl product. It always controls my friz
"
"
not real stuff
"
"
I really wanted to like this product. I already love this brand's curl cream. I just needed something with a little more hold for specially humid days and I thought this gel would do the trick. While my hair does tend to look nice the first day I use this product, on the second day and third (I wash my hair every three days to prevent over drying it), it just stiffens up my hair and builds up terribly. My hair feels dryer, stiff and completely unhealthy while using this gel. I was surprised because I've seen other ""curly girls"" swear by this gel. For me at least, it did not work. I have long hair that is a mix of 3a and 3b curls.
"
"
This product made my naturally curly hair frizzy and tangles after a few short hours
"
"
no me gusto es muy aguada y no dura mucho en el cabello
"
"
I haven't received gel I ordered at this time. I have already used product. I love it. I have gone sulfate and silicone free and my hair has done much better. I have curly, dry, bi-racial hair. I use this and macadamia nut oil daily in my wet hair. My curls are more defined and less frizzy since I started this new hair care regime. I also switched to a microfiber towel. My hair was so bad before I couldn't wash it more than once a week, now I am able to wash every other day. Happy for the first time with my curls and not trying to flat iron it every day.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Best gel I've ever used on my hair. Really defines curls and my hair is super soft after it dries and I scrunch per directions.
"
"
Maybe my lost curly hair will never be back. I used to have curlier hair, after pregnancy, it is just wavy. From the reviews I got the feeling that wavy could become curlier. It is a tiny bit curlier but this one has almost the same effect on my hair than the other version that is not the strong hold. I use it anyway, and haven't seen that white residue that many people commented about and I was scared off. Also, instructions indicate to use a devacurl towel...so maybe if I have the complete set could be better.
"
"
unequaled among hair gels - the BEST
"
"
OMG this is amazing!
"
"
Perfect for not only my curly girl but also me and my straight hair.  Love the smell, love the product.  A little bit goes a long way on straight hair.
"
"
i have very frizzy curly hair. This looked horrible on the 2nd day. It did not hold up in humid weather
"
"
Great for curly hair.
"
"
I have curly hair works great on my hair, I use it everyday.
"
"
Maybe my frizzy hair will just never be nice and curly but this product didn't help it in any way. When I use it, my hair is like a rat's nest by the end of the day - completely tangled at the ends.
"
"
My daughter uses but no curls for her. She scrunched them through her towel dried hair but not much. She got some beachy waves but not curls like they claim. I think this would be good for short haired girls. But the smell is nice and she said it makes her hair feel thicker so she's using it up.
"
"
great product! awesome service
"
"
I have naturally wavy hair; but my hair must not be wavy enough for this product to work by itself with a diffuser. In order to get this product to work for me, I need to shower at night, put the gel in my wet hair, and then get up in the morning and curl my hair with a curling iron. The curls stay significantly longer than if I just curled my hair without using the gel so I am happy with how the product works; I was just hoping it would work for me without having to use a curling iron.
"
"
holds good
"
"
Excellent
"
"
i love it
"
"
Expensive but works well and not much is needed per use.
"
"
Such a great product. Doesn't leave your hair crunchy or greasy. Soft and clean curls.
"
"
keeps my curls looking good all day
"
"
My fine curly/wavy hair is easily bogged down by product. It's so hard to find something that works. But I think I finally did! I use a sulfate-free shampoo, skip the conditioner, towel dry, apply this with a bit extra water, scrunch to the scalp with a flat hand a few times, dry a bit with the pixie method of diffusing, let it air dry the rest of the way, scrunch out the crunch, and voila! My fine hair shows and holds lovely SOFT curls all day long and can be easily refreshed for the next two or three days.
"
"
Love how it works
"
"
I love how soft my hair feels with this product! It makes my curls look great, too!!
"
"
This is a great gel that will define your curls without making them crunchy. I like that my hair is soft.
"
"
Like the firmer hold better.
"
"
it does the job just what i need
"
"
I love deva curl products.
"
"
Great for my natural curly hair.  Good buy
"
"
Deva curl is fantastic
"
"
Arrive on time...great.
"
"
Couldn't use it arrived frozen solid
"
"
love this stuff
"
"
My favorite Gel doesn't get flaky
"
"
This hair gel is NOT MAGICAL so don't believe the hype. It is just hair gel, and in my opinion, it is really heavy and sticky and makes my hair feel like straw when I use it. It's a little too ""extra hold"" for my taste, I just didn't expect that. I have long hair and it really makes it sticky and easily knotted when I wear this gel. I'm  a little sad because I spent so much on a giant bottle of gel that I won't use, but maybe one day I'll be able to give it away to someone who likes this product!
"
"
Started using this product along with the conditioner. My curls have never looked so great!
"
"
Used Wen before, always frizzy!! Now I Love the curls!!!
"
"
I love this gel so much! it leaves your hair super light weight and the curls alive. I like to use it with their volumizing foam (it's like a mousse) for extra definition and hold. seriously, you can't go wrong with this gel.
"
"
This is the best gel for curly hair.  I've been using it with other deva products for several years.  I love it.
"
"
Best hairgel for curly hair! Recommend the entire Devacurl line....no crunchiness/wet look. Love it!
"
"
My hair looks and feel great. The jel keeps my curls soft.
"
"
I like the gel and the way it smells, but it was packaged poorly and a good amount of gel leaked out of the bottle.
"
"
Didp nopt work for my 3b curls. Sticking with my eco gel
"
"
will never use another gel again!
"
"
Love this stuff. I have frizzy curls and live in NYC and this is the only gel that keeps my hair controlled on hot, humid summer days.
"
"
Good product.  Works as intended.
"
"
It works👍
"
"
I waited to post a review on this product. When I first started using it I wasn't happy with the results. I gave it a few weeks and applied it different ways. I've figured out what works best for my hair and I'm very happy with the product now and will order it again.
"
"
I have bought this many times and love it.
"
"
Love it! Works wonders for my hair.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
Great product for natural curly hair
"
"
Omg this is sex for my hair! Sorry best way to describe it lol.... Girls you need this product!
"
"
Best gel ever!
"
"
Best gel I used yet!  No frizz and perfect texture.
"
"
The product was like a water substance that did nothing for my curls.
"
"
Light weight hold, no build up.
"
"
Leaves my hair amazing !! I have 3b/3c curls and it's the only gel that I swear by
"
"
Best for curls and amazing smell, definitely recommend.
"
"
I am a little enamored with this bottle. I only have wavy hair. This gives me actual curls. It gives me lift . It gives me volume.It's beyond my expectations. It's a Hugh bottle and when I saw it I regretted getting such a big thing. Now I see that I use it everyday after my shower. It's a great investment!
"
"
I love this gel. I use the cleanser and conditioner as well. Makes my hair soft and manageable. It works with curly hair.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Have been using this for years.  It works well.
"
"
I Love Love Love this gel.  My hair is soft and manageable and not crunchy or frizzy and I actually like it.  I use it with the NoPoo shampoo and DevaCare One conditioner.and I finally have found products that I love.
"
"
Left my hair very frizzy and flat. Didn't work for me!
"
"
Love deva curl. This product works wonderfully if you use the system
"
"
Only hair gel I use as someone with type 3B curls. A little drying though
"
"
This gel did wonders for my curls.  I have naturally curly hair between 2C-3A/B, different curl patterns throughout. I didn't know how to take care of my curly hair so I straightened my hair pretty much every day for about 5 years. It's been almost a year since I've straightened my hair and the Deva Curl products have helped me with my transition.This gel, when used correctly, will give you the definition and hold you need for bouncy curls.it's very important to use this as directed. I find that if I use this while my hair is sopping wet (directly out of the shower), and use the Deva Curl clips at the roots of my hair, I'll get the best results.  Let your hair dry 90-95% before ""scrunching the crunch"" This is important! Don't touch your hair while it's air drying.This product left my hair soft and shiny and I'm able to always get 2 day curls, some days, 3rd day hair as well when I pineapple my hair overnight.  if your curls seem a little droppy on day 2, just wet your hair a little bit with some water and use a pea size amount of gel overtop and they'll bounce right back.Just repurchased my second bottle in a 32 oz!!

Product works just like description

I love the Devacurl line!  I have very fine, wavy/curly hair. This product brings out the curl without leaving a crunchy feel or the wet look (where your hair still looks wet after it is completely dry).
"
"
Amazing... great for my curls
"
"
This is the best product I have ever used. Period. Scrunch it and let curls set, shake out, amazing results.
"
"
Really give curls definition and stops it just being wavy or frizzy. Highly reccomended product :)
"
"
Love the smell!
"
"
My hair is a combination of 3B-3C and devacurl ultra defining gel defines my girls without leaving it crunchy. Smell is amazing! definitely recommendable
"
"
I love this gel.  It lets me enjoy my naturally curly hair without being sticky or or causing build up.
"
"
It makes my hair so curly, i can't complain about it, the best you can do is( if you don't want to define every single curl) to put some of it in your hair and then putting it in your hair starting at your hair-ends.
"
"
It is a really good product that helps with frizz but I have noticed stiffness in my hair do to the product.
"
"
Best curl gel ever.  Does not flake or make hair hard.
"
"
Dried my hair out, had to put some serious oil on it so it wouldn't feel dry. Not worth the hype.
"
"
LOVE

This is a great product for my thick curly hair. It greatly reduces frizz. I just have to be careful with the amount used because if I use too much my hair gets crunchy.
"
"
Nice hold
"
"
Delivered extremely fast and just as I ordered! Product is amazing on my curly hair. You do need to watch a YouTube video or go to devacurl website to make sure you use it correctly.
"
"
It helps hold the shape of my curls, cuts down on frizz, and doesn't seem to weigh down my hair.
"
"
I love it!!

I heard that the gel is the magic and the curling cream that is meant to be paired with it is pointless without the gel. I have type 3b hair and honestly it isn't as great as it is glorified to be. What I do like is the soft to touch, no hardness the gel leaves me with when my hair dries and i lovee the fullness it gives me when it drys (pillow soft for sure!) --but I do not like that it does not hold enough for 2nd day hair.I have to rewet my hair again and apply product to get my hair to look nice the 2nd day. It is too expensive to apply everyday. You will also have to apply a lot of oils since it does leave your hair looking dull and not shiny. Although it is soft... what can I say, we are all still searching for THE perfect product...
"
"
Was excited to try this, as I hear good things about the Deva products. Got the ultra hold hoping it would perform better in the tropics than my usual product (which is a different brand). Nope. No hold, not much definition. Did my usual co-wash, put lots of the product in with my hair very wet, used microfiber towel to squeeze and dab excess, and then plopped and went to bed... my usual product performs much much better. I know it's not supposed to be crunchy, but it felt and looked like I didn't have anything in my hair. Sticking to Curl Keeper by Curly Hair Solutions. Cheaper and better.
"
"
This gel had no hold and left my hair looking super frizzy. Hated it.
"
"
still  like it  for my hair .
"
"
I have used Ouidad Climate Control Gel for years and wanted to give this a try to compare.  I felt like I needed to use a lot of this product and that my hair just seemed to soak up a lot of it.  It also doesn't really glide on my hair (which is why I decided to stick with my Climate control gel that is a liquid).  Once I had enough in, it worked well on my hair, but not any better than my Ouidad.  I love the smell though!  I will use the rest of the bottle, but will not buy more.
"
"
This is amazing.  I've gotten a ton of compliments from people who had no idea I had curly hair!  Love.
"
"
Love Deva products, but unfortunately not a fan of this one. The gel made my hair super dry.
"
"
great stuff
"
"
I ended up giving this away after using it twice.  I have very temperamental hair.  It is thick, curly and just overall- DIFFICULT.  I don't think this product is horrible- it just wasn't a good fit for my hair type. If you have hair like mine and are looking for something to hold curls and leave you frizz free, this is not for you.  Maybe I wasn't using enough?  I am not sure, maybe just get a small bottle or sample to try before buying the big bottle!  That is what I should have done!
"
"
At first, this thick, sticky gel made me think that I was going to get a lot of hold for my curls, but not really. I have to use a lof of gel to get more hold.
"
"
My hair has never looked so good! I recommend this to anyone who has curls!
"
"
I've used this gel for several years now.  Customer for life.
"
"
Great for curly hair. Stops the frizz
"
"
I still get frizzes even after tons of product!
"
"
I was hesitant to buy a gel (since it usually gives my hair a crunchy look/feeling), but this gel is great. My curls look fantastic, it's lightweight, and my hair is still soft to the touch. I have used the cream in the past (which I also like) but have decided that my curls last and look best with this product.
"
"
My go-to product for my curly hair.
"
"
Good product, doesn't make my hair ""crispy"", holds curls all day
"
"
I have wavy to curly hair without this product and did not find it to make my hair any curlier or even wavier. In fact, it tended to weigh my hair down and make it straight. However, even though it didn't give me nice curls, it is a really good volumizing gel.
"
"
Love this stuff.  The price on Amazon was great.  It came very soon.
"
"
Works well
"
"
Works great on curly hair (to hold more natural curl.)
"
"
Ever since Redken stopped making their Fresh Curl Refiner, this has been my go to product. It goes on very light and hold my curls for several days.
"
"
Love this product. Love how my hair looks after I put the product in. My curls look beautiful and defined. People have stopped me in the street to ask me what I use in my hair. I am African American with curly hair. This product works great for my hair. Hope it works well for you.
"
"
Best gel I have ever used
"
"
This gel goes great with the No Poo and One Condition shower combo. It smells just as good and is not hard or crunchy.
"
"
I received a free sample of this with a purchase and fell in love with it.  I shopped around and this was one of the best prices I could find so I decided to buy.  The bottle is HUGE and the product is okay but I feel like the sample I previously received was more effective than this.  I think next time i'll buy it in the store or directly from DevaCurl's website.
"
"
Love love love this!

I was not born with curly hair. When I was little, my hair was always stick straight, but once I hit puberty my hair progressively got wavier and curlier as I got older. My entire family has straight hair, so no one had any clue how to take care of my texture. I've been trying different products for years, and nothing worked. It got to the point where most of the time, I was just doing my best to tame my hair by brushing the curls out of it.I saw this product on a BuzzFeed post, of all places, and when I saw all the 5 star reviews, I decided to give it a try.This product has changed my life. My curls are much healthier and more defined, and I no longer feel the need to tame my hair. I like this product so much that I ordered other products from this company 2 days after receiving this.
"

Great price - works fantastically for my very curly hair
"

Its does a great job !

This is the only conditioner that agrees with my fine, wavy hair leaving it smooth, moisturized, and healthy throughout the day.

Do NOT use this product. IT IS TOXIC. I have lost SO much hair. I have brittle nails and dry skin. I stopped using them a few weeks ago and for the first time in a long time, I have baby hair growing out. STAY AWAY!!
"
"
This product completely transformed my hair! It's super shiny, smooth and feels SO much healthier!
"
"
I love the products themselves! I use it all the time. The best products I’ve found for my 3A/b hair. Products cane damaged tho. I plan on just swapping out the pumps tho when I run out of my current bottles. Too much hassle to return.

I have naturally curly hair Abd. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that not only takes my hair but makes it pop. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Price is cheaper than in the salons.
"
"
Expensive
"
"
DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT USE DEVA CURL! This product RUINED my hair and I haven't even finished my first set of shampoo and conditioner. I'm selecting 1 star because the app won't let me give less.

I have never written a review before but feel so strongly about this that I have no choice. I saw other reviewers warnings about this not being an authentic product. There were so many other reviews that were positive that I hoped it was just a bad batch. However, I was wrong.... oh so wrong.It arrived on time as promised. I was a little leary based on the reviews so I opened both bottles and they didn’t smell bad so I ran up and showered and used them. I used them both and got out of the shower and realized my hair smelled like I had just gotten a perm! I thought maybe it was just me but the smell kept getting stronger and stronger. I used some hair gel because my hair is curly and was going to let it dry naturally. I went downstairs to get some work done and my mom yelled out “why do I smell perm products?” I about died as not only did my hair smell bad my scalp was starting to tingle.I immediately had my mom help me wash my hair again and I scrubbed and scrubbed. It’s been 30 minutes and my scalp is still tingling and I feel like I still smell like perm. I’m going to have to was my hair again tonight in hopes that this doesn’t make my hair fall out. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
"

I bought this a while back before my salon bought Deva Curl product ran out because my hair was doing great.  My curls were soft, bouncy, and not frizzy.  Now that I am using this one purchased on Amazon, I have been feeling my hair extremely dry, brittle, tangled, and it is not soft.  I kept thinking maybe it was the change in weather and I needed to adjust how much product I am using, but nothing is helping.  I just don't feel the product is the same as the salon purchased one.  What a waste of money.

BUYER BEWARE. If you take your chances and buy anyhow, check the package as soon as it is delivered.As soon as I opened the Amazon box there was a strong spicy incense type scent. I assumed that it was from wherever it was packed and ignored it.45 days after delivery I finally finished my last bottle of Deva No Poo Shampoo (purchased at Ulta & great to the last drop!), so this morning I opened this shampoo and was immediately hit with the same spicy scent - strong enough to trigger my asthma (I have issues with perfumes).I decided this scent wasn't for me, but needed to wash my hair so I put it on anyhow and immediately had a weird tingling sensation, like when using peppermint oil, but there was no peppermint scent or cool sensation.... just the tingling. I immediately rinsed it out and did a clarifying treatment (left-over Ouidad product I had). 6 hours later and there is still a spot on my scalp that feels sunburned.I only took the chance because it stated the manufacturer was DevaCurl and was being fulfilled by Amazon. Unfortunately now I'm beyond the 30 day returns window and so I'm out $53.EDIT - Thank you **AMAZON** - they refunded the $53 I paid for this product even though it is outside of their normal return window due to the problems I had. THANK YOU!!!!!
"
"
I was willing to pay a premium for a really excellent hair product. But, this isn't it. My hair does not like these products at all. They are so thick and hard to even get out of the pump. They are difficult to distribute throughout my thick hair. And even after I finish with both of them, I feel like there is a sticky residue left behind. I'm accustomed to conditioner washing to prevent shampoo friction, so it's not the lack of suds that is the problem for me. I just don't know why this didn't work for me. I got through about half the botttles and then I gave up. They went into the trash this morning.

I switched to this no-poo hair cleansing regimen several months ago because my hair was starting to shed a lot and I thought this would help my scalp be healthier. I do love the smell and texture of both the no-poo and conditioner. However, my hair continued to shed, and eventually started coming out at an alarming rate. It wasn't until I went out of town for a week and forgot my DevaCurl products and was forced to buy a dupe that I realized, hmmm, is it possible the DevaCurl was making my hair fall out? I've been using the dupe product (RenPure cleansing conditioner) for about six weeks now and my hair loss has been drastically reduced. I am losing only about 1/3 of the hair I was losing before, and I no longer have to pull loose hairs from my head during the day. I will say that for about four weeks I was doing castor oil masks on my scalp and hair a few times a week to help regrowth, so maybe that's what has slowed my hair loss. I haven't done any castor oil masks in two weeks and my hair loss is still at an all time low. I noticed that my hair is much softer now when I touch it, whereas when I was using the DevaCurl products my hair felt very dry and brittle. So, I don't know if these problems I was having are due to the DevaCurl products or if it was just coincidence, but I won't be going back to them.
"

Was not the same smell as the 12oz bottles I bought in the past which had an orange citrus smell. I HATE the smell these I got.  The only indication this DevaCare No-Poo cleanser is different than the first kind a bought was that is says it is the ""Original"". The only reason I am still using it because it does a decent job on my hair, it was very expensive and I didn't start using it until it was too late to return it. I sometimes have to use regular shampoo just to give my nose a break. I am including a picture of the first bottle I bought to show you that there is no wording stating this DevaCare No-Poo smells any different than any other DevaCare No-Poo. Amazon and/or DevaCare need to have a much better product description.
"
"
I have used Deva for years, and both the no-poo and one-condition products are white with a distinct organic scent. I received ""orange colored/scented"" products. I won't order again from these companies.
"
"
I have used these products for a few years now and I do enjoy the products. The problem here is that the shipping method on this particular shipment was horrible. There was no plastic encasing the shampoo and conditioner to secure the tops so the screw-on top on both bottles became loose and inside of the shipping bag was full of shampoo and conditioner because it leaked out of the bottles.  I would estimate that I lost approximately an eighth of the product due to it leaking out of the bottles.  The photos reflect product outside of the bottles before I was able to take them out of the shipping bag.
"
"
I have been using DevaCurl products for over two years now. I usually purchase them from Ulta or from my Deva stylist. However, I purchased this set of shampoo and conditioner when it was on special for $50 because the reviews seemed good and it was a great deal. When it arrived, I enjoyed the shampoo but the conditioner, one that I have been using for years, was not quite right. It didn't feel the same in my hair. I usually use the delight no poo so this shampoo was not unusual. After a few weeks of struggling with the texture of my hair and blaming it on possible hard water issues, I purchased a smaller bottle of the conditioner at Ulta to keep at my gym. The real bottle smells COMPLETELY different, less chemical, and works as my old bottles have worked on my hair.I am not sure if this is fake or just a bad batch, but BEWARE. You will not receive an effective product.
"
"
Not sure what is in these bottles but it's not DevaCurl products. Both the color and smell are completely different and the tops are taped down as if the bottles have been opened and refilled. I am pretty sure I've been scammed.

The product I received was of inferior quality. I recently used some genuine devacurl product from a travel pack, and my hair feels so much better. I'm so disappointed. Im  going to buy only directly from the company from now on :( I wish I could trust amazon resellers.
"
"
Buyers NEED to scroll down and read the description!  The picture and top of page description are deceiving. The product actually being sold is called DevaCare NOT DevaCurl. They are made by the same company, but DevaCare is for colored hair and is fortified with more Vitamin C. The product description further down on the page states this, but the picture and top of the page description/heading leads you to believe that you're purchasing the DevaCurl product that you can buy at the salon.
"
"
This is NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT! The shampoo usually leaves my hair feeling so soft before I even put the conditioner in, but this one had my hair feeling so dry, and brittle, literally felt like straw!! My hair started coming out, EVERY time I'd run fingers through it or comb/brush it while wet to detangle, so much of my hair was coming out that it looked like I cut! This product is terrible, don't waste your money or your hairs health. Just order from DEVA CURL !!
"
"
Many people have complained about this product is a fake, but it is not. If you read the label carefully it says Deva Care which is for chemically treated and/or colored hair. If you go to the Deva Curl website you will read about the two different products - Deva Curl and Deva Care. The color difference between the two is from the orange peel extract that is added to the shampoo and conditioner for chemically treated and/or colored hair. I love this product and will continue to order it.

I don't have curly hair, but I do live in a super dry climate and my semi-wavy hair is always frizzy and fried looking.  It helps not to shampoo every day, but my fine, thin hair starts looking oily and flat very quickly.  So I decided to try this NO-Poo approach and have found it to be very helpful for keeping my problem hair in good, shiny condition.  It gives my hair a clean and moisturized appearance without the harsh detergents that are so damaging.I highly recommend this product to anyone who has fragile hair, even if their hair is not actually curly.
"
"
I don’t have curly hair, but heard this was a great gentle shampoo for daily use so I decided to try it. My hair is a lot softer after making the switch! My hair tends to get oily fast, this non lathering shampoo makes it feel clean and soft without stripping it, and the conditioner is nice too. All smells pretty good although I get a whiff of sunscreen when conditioning every now and then. After switching to this product, I got a trim and stopped using a hair dryer, now I only use a soft t-shirt, my hair is growing in faster, and thicker. Highly recommend it! The book, “The Curly Girl Methid” is what got me into this new healthy hair regimen.
"
"
My go to hair washing duo. Other shampoos left my hair frizzy, and my scalp itchy. I tried No-poo once, and I have never gone back. I know they are expensive, but I can't go back to other shampoos now that I have tried it. My hair has never looked better, and I no longer have bad hair days.
"
"
I have wavy hair and after using this product for a while I've been getting so many compliments on my hair, something that's never happened before! This shampoo enhances my hairs natural ""wavyness"" and makes it look like I've spent a lot of time on it when really I've just rolled out of bed. It also smells great and will last you forever if you buy the large bottles!
"
"
I have used DevaCurl for years and was really glad to find it for such a great price. However, when I received the bottles some of the No-Poo and Conditioner had oozed out inside the plastic bag they are shipped in and when I removed the bag to clean the bottles off I immediately noticed that they did not smell AT ALL like the shampoo and conditioner. I still had some in my old bottles in my shower so I compared... and the consistency, smell, color, and feel was all wrong. I am 99% sure that what I was sold was not really DevaCurl No-Poo and One Conditioner. Returned.
"
"
If I could give this product 6 stars I would!!! I’ve been searching for a brand that compliments my curls perfectly for years, one that I wouldn’t need to put any product in my hair after the shower to tame the frizz and get the curls to look right. With DevaCurl I just hopped out of the shower and let my hair dry naturally, it’s frizz free and my curls look stunning!! I’m very pleased and will buy this brand from now on!
"
"
I think the deva curl shampoo and conditioner is making my hair fall out!! Every time I shower I little have a hand full of hair come out of my brush and when I run my fingers through my hair even more hair comes out! And I haven’t worn my hair down curly in a little while but I swear it feels thinner. I asked My stylist about it and she said you lose 100 strands of hair a day and if I only wash once a week then it’s 700 coming out at once but I don’t believe it. And I’ve been reading a lot of reviews about deva curl making hair fall out. I’m stopping this product immediately and I wish I could return it.

I've been using Devacurl forever and I love it, so I have nothing bad to say about the product. However, the packaging in this shipment didn't have any air bubble buffering in the box. The box itself and other items in the box, were not damaged. Unfortunately the duo pumps were damaged and a good bit of product is in the package and box. If this wasn't something I needed immediately, I would go through the hassle of returning it and reordering. I understand that sometimes things go wrong in the shipping process. I am just disappointed that I paid for the large bottles and so much is wasted and there is no way to contact the seller.
"
"
The fact that I use this product on my 3 year old and bought the big bottles just for her hair is why this makes me upset. I of course am guilty of not reading the reviews because I thought it was fine due to the manufacturer name being devacurl. I just bought them...there was no distinct scent when I  pumped the shampoo in my hand but as soon as it hit her wet hair it was a very strong incense smell. I immediately had my mom look up the reviews and now I am very upset that someone would make fake product using their name and labels. Very disappointed momma here!! Hopefully the return process is easy so I can get my money back and go buy the real stuff at ulta.

I love, love, love the DevaCurl line. I use their No-Poo, their conditioner, their Ultra Defining gel, and their styling pomade. The No-Poo and the conditioner have a nice floral smell (in my opinion), and they both have a nice creamy texture. I was using Redken before I switched to DevaCurl, and I was really disappointed with how loose my curls seemed to be. Once I switched to DevaCurl, my curls bounced up so amazingly well that even my stylist commented that my hair seemed to be getting curlier every time she saw me. I highly recommend the DevaCurl line to anybody - curly hair or straight. My mother has straight hair, but she switched to DevaCurl because it wasn't as harsh on her hair as regular shampoo. She loves the fact that she can go several days now without her hair becoming super greasy. When I purchased this set, the bottles did come with a pump on each bottle (no regular caps), but I think it depends on which seller you buy it from.
"
"
Because this product doesn’t have all the chemicals in it that you were supposed to avoid if you have curly hair is probably doing more good than I know. However I see zero difference when it comes to moisture in my hair using this product. As soon as I am done with it I will not be buying it again.
"
"
I've been using this product for months.  This must be my third purchase from this seller and I will continue to buy here and use.  This shampoo makes my hair really clean, soft and manageable. I have wavy, course hair that tends to poof out during humid weather etc.  This Shampoo helps my hair with the humidity and just keeps it clean until I want to wash it again.  This may sound bad but with this shampoo, I could probably go a week without having to wash my hair, though I don't...  Shampoo works great and smells great.  I love it!!!
"
"
This is fake Deva Curl. I was using it for months with terrible results on my hair before learning that fake Deva Curl is rampant on Amazon. I switched to a new set of products I ordered directly from Deva Curl and my hair is back to normal within days. I have no question this is fake Deva Curl. I have been using unknown ingredients on my body for months and that is alarming.
"
"
In an effort to remove chemicals from my daily routine (and help my wavy hair) I found the DC product line & have continued to reorder. I have less hair breakage/loss when shampooing & my color doesn't wash out like with other shampoos (even the sulfite free stuff I used to use). Since this stuff doesn't dry out my scalp, my skin doesn't over-produce oil anymore so I don't get greasy at the roots like I used to after a day. I really can't say enough good things about this product & highly recommend it to anyone with color-treated hair or a dry-slash-oily scalp. Happy customer here.

My girlfriend is an advocate for WEN but wanted to work another product into her hair care routine. She is growing out her natural color and is trying to get her hair as healthy as possible. This product came recommended by a friend and my girlfriend loves it. It gives her hair a noticeable shimmer and I happen to like the scent so win/win. You also get a very large quantity.This product is a little pricey by my standards but I am assured that this is a great value for the price. The girlfriend loves it and assures me she will buy it again when it runs out.

I have struggled with my ever changing curls for DECADES. I had gotten to the point where I'd just let my hair fall limp and then put it in a bun. Every. Single. Day. It was so damaged and lifeless.  I just had no hope for having nice hair again. Finding this shampoo and conditioner has been a godsend. My curls have never been softer, healthier or more consistent. I just couldn't be more pleased. The smell of the shampoo is wonderful and I use the One Condition as a leave in.
"
"
This is not the real product. My daughter turned me on to DevaCurl by gifting me a set she bought from her hairdresser. This product doesn't smell or work the same. Will only purchase from salon from now on.
"
"
I LOVE this stuff!! I have been using WEN and it is great stuff too. I wanted to try this brand because it is a bit cheaper and has great reviews.  I won't be going back to WEN!! My hair is thin and the curls aren't really tight, just soft. This stuff made my curls curlier, spiral and calm!! I don't love the smell but I have had a few people comment on how good my hair smells. To me it smells a bit like chemicals, but not bad kinda like when you get a perm? This is the best my curls have been and i love it. I also use Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Gel and it is great together!!
"

I bought this shampoo and conditioner by accident.  I didn't understand that DevaCare is for color treated hair, and I meant to buy the regular DevaCurl products with the green label.  However, the products both work just fine for my dry, curly hair.  I don't find them to be too heavy or anything like that.  My only complaint about these products is their smell.  They smell like a rotten creamsicle.  Then again, I'm 7 months pregnant, I'm very sensitive to smells.  I love the way the regular DevaCurl products smell, so I'm disappointed that these are so different.  On the positive side, the shampoo smell doesn't linger, especially after I put product in my hair.  Smell aside, I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is soft and hydrated.
"
"
I bought smaller  product just to try it out to see if it was as good as I had heard. The first day I couldn't see the difference but the second day it was amazing. It smells great ! I am a huge fan of great smelling hair.  When I got the bottles I was a little disappointed in the size for the price, but the product was so great I bought the 32 oz large bottles of the shampoo and conditioner. absolutely love this product and highly recommend it for anyone with curly hair.
"
"
5 Stars for the product - 0 Stars for the Seller.The product in general is a great product! I highly recommend it. However, the items purchased from this seller are questionable. The shampoo was fine. The conditioner appeared to be an opened item and was extremely watered down. It was so runny, I could hardly hold it in my hands. I've purchased this product from a salon and beauty supply store so I know what it should be like - not runny, but thick. Upon opening and dispensing for the first time, the product was already loaded and ready to go, unlike the newly packaged shampoo which took about 5 pumps before anything came out.I'd look elsewhere to buy this item - just to be sure I get what I actually paid for.
"
"
I can't wait until this bottle of shampoo is gone. I bought the wrong stuff, clearly, as I too, prefer my shampoo to lather. I recently got some new (and different) Deva Curl stuff from the Deva Curl company and it's much, much better - including the conditioner.
"
"
This is listed as DevaCurl one condition and no poo and is pictured as being the original, but it's actually DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition Decadence. Anyone with curly hair knows that the shampoo type can make a huge difference, and the Decadence is much more moisturizing which means if you don't have super dry hair, it makes your hair incredibly greasy. I requested a replacement item thinking maybe they had just sent the incorrect item, but the replacement was the same, so it's actually the product description that is wrong.
"
"
I love this shampoo and conditioner set. I've used it now for almost a year and my hair has never felt heather. I have naturally wavy hair, and no matter what I did, I'd end up with a giant fluffy mess. This product has tamed my mane, and my hair has never looked so shiny. I get random people on the street complimenting my hair. That NEVER happened to me before, I feel so proud to have joined the ranks of the good hair day people.
"
"
 The product run out of the bottle and the scent is just awful, like incense or something. Just seems like the seller changed the product inside. I don’t recomend and I’m about to ask Amazon for refund this item. The smells is so strong that dont get out of my hands even after washing a lot.(I dont speak fluent english)
"
"
Beware when you buy these, because mine were fake. In the products I received, both the ""No-Poo"" and the ""One Condition"" had the same smell, which was also really nasty, and they looked and felt the same when they should be different. My hair, which loves the real DevaCurl products hated these and was a frizzy mess. I called DevaCurl and they said the products I got are most likely a knockoff. I thought I was saving money but I was actually wasting it on products that did more harm than good. Do your hair a favor and buy from DevaCurl directly or find an authorized seller.
"
"
I am VERY irritated!!! It is my first time trying DevaCurl and it was only just delivered for me. I have natural hair that is very very thick, dry, and needs lots of moisture. I was excited to try the Original product and was instead sent the Low Poo and Delight conditioner. I DO NOT need Low Poo, I purchased Co Wash. and I certainly don’t need a lightweight moisturizer for wavy hair. I wouldn’t be so pissed off if it wasn’t so expensive. Don’t charge me $60 and send me the wrong products that won’t work for my hair.
"
"
I love these products and I will use nothing else now that I've become so familiar with how to use them and how to style my hair. I highly recommend that before using these, read the Curly Girl book so you know exactly how these products should be used. So many people have commented on how healthy and pretty my hair is. I've even had hairstylists that I don't know come up to me and exclaim on how perfect my curls are so I'm loving my hair. In addition, the devacurl styling products are also very good and when used together.
"
"
My hair always lacked moisture and I was always frizzy. This has helped my hair to be more natural without the frizz. I can wear it curly and down without being self conscious of my big hair.
"
"
Love these, I would agree that the packaging seems a little sketchy -- they came in a box with tape over the pumps, and it looked like my conditioner had slightly less liquid in it than the shampoo. They smell ok and were a clean white color, so do seem to be the same product that I have purchased before. I also saw these exact bottles in CVS recently for $41 a piece - this is a great deal on amazon!
"
"
While this didn't 100% work for me, I still gave this 5 stars because it was my fault, not the product's . I meant to order the low-poo since my hair is so oily and that's what I had last time, but I bought this by mistake.This stuff is wonderful for those with curly or wavy hair. My curls have thrived since I switched to this line! The only thing I really have to say about it is if you do have hair that is prone to being really oily, make sure you get the low-poo and not the no-poo.My husband has curly hair, too, and he decided to use this when he ran out of his own products. He uses this now, as well, and he loves it too.
"
"
This product is very moisturizing, but not great for wavy hair. I think it would probable work perfectly for someone with coarser, curly hair. But it is too heavy for looser curls or waves. Would recommend buying if your hair is super dry or damaged. But if you don't have the super spirally/kinky curs, this might weigh your hair down and actually take some of the wave out.
"
"
Love the product. However even though it was taped it still manage to leak.
"
"
I really didn’t care for this shampoo and conditioner. I’ve used foamless shampoos before and absolutely loved them, so I was really disappointed with this product.  It left white residue on my hair and scalp no matter how much I rinsed and made sure I got everything out.  I could scratch my head and there was a white film in my fingernails- really gross! The package also came damaged with about a quarter of the product spilled all over the box, which was a shame because this was pretty pricy. I ended up buying a different product and have had no issues.  Pretty upset with the wasted money on this.
"
"
I don't want to sound dramatic here, but this haircare set changed my life! I've been using DevaCurl for just over a year and it is amazing! My curls look great for a longer period of time and I feel great knowing that I'm not stripping my hair with grocery store products. The fact that the shampoo doesn't lather does take a little getting used to, but now I cringe at the thought of putting ""foaming chemicals"" on my hair. The lathering effect is just that...an effect! It does nothing for your hair.
"
"
DevaCurl Apparently changed their formula since the last time they bought. The shampoo smells like roses and dust. The conditioner smells like lemon floor cleaner. Such a disappointment. I used DevaCurl exclusively until I couldn't afford it anymore and splurged on this and now I smell gross and my hair is falling out. Hooray!
"
"
Shampoo & condition duo helped my curls regain their life after years of straightening and coloring. My hair has ways to go but in the short amount of time I’ve used it (since feb) I have seen my curls regaining their shape etc. love it & will continue to purchase.
"
"
I used to love this product but they changed the formula to a horribly perfumed version and now I get a migraine every time I use it.  I wish they would go back to the orange cream version.  If anyone knows how to get some of the original version, please let me know !!
"
"
I love the way my hair is soft, curly, never frizzy with these products. I do notice some dander-looking stuff by my scalp (may be the moisture lock spray in the line), and I do find that it looks dirty a bit faster than other shampoos. I normally wash twice a week, with dry shampoo on the last day. For those noticing a lot of build-up, there's a reason that the whole line doesn't contain silicones--don't use sulfate-free shampoo like this and think it'll remove products with a lot of silicone.
"
"
I love devachan products. I used to use this duo a couple of years ago, but was concerned about the price and switched over to a different brand. I noticed that my hair has been super dry this winter, so I thought I would give devachan another try. Definitely worth the money ! Curls have been super moisturized and glossy lately. You can also leave in the conditioner and or use it when styling your hair.
"
"
This stuff dried my hair out so bad I had to cut it.  It did not work like or smell like the stuff I had purchased in the salon.  I am skeptical of its validity.  ☹️
"
"
The shampoo and conditioner were identical. I have been using DevaCurl for years and the shampoo is normally a thinner liquid and the conditioner is thick. The smell is even different.
"
"
If you have ever used real DevaCurl products, you will be able to tell the difference. Not only can I smell and see the difference in texture, my hair feels disgusting after thoroughly washing and rinsing. Very disappointed.
"
"
This is the BEST PRODUCT EVER ESPECIALLY FOR CURLY HAIR! I have been using this product for over a year now. It has completely changed the way I treat my hair. I no longer use regular shampoo or conditioner.  I have defined curly hair. I no longer lose serious amounts of hair while I’m in the shower! I love the scent, the way my hair looks and feels! I have nothing but praises for this product and it’s line of products! It’s worth the money. You will not be disappointed! I promise, I even have received COMPLEMENTS FROM MEN!
"
"
I love these products so much! I've tried so many different products for curly hair over the years and by far these are the best.The 'No Poo' is great as both a cleanser and a conditioner, i honestly don't really need to use the one condition i think i just do out of habit from years of that Shampoo + Conditioner routine. In saying that i also totally love the one condition too. Both products leave my hair smelling lovely and feeling super soft but without turning my curls into a frizzy mess!I tend to use as little as poss so the bottles end up lasting me a long time and i think its better for my hair too.Wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to anyone with curls.
"
"
As someone with naturally curly and wavy hair, my hairdresser is a certified DevaCurl stylist and highly recommends their products and their signature cut. Both of which make for gorgeous hair!
"
"
THIS PRODUC IS NOT LEGIT. DO NOT BUY
"
"
This product is perfect for my botticelli curls.  My curls have come alive.  It is important ot use the product correctly.  I swear by my Curly Girl Handbook with DVD.  For less than $10 you can earn to care and style your hair the way it was meant to be.  I use to fight with my curls to straighten them out to look like every one else.  Now I get so many compliments and remarks about my sassy, sexy curls!  I LOVE MY HAIR FINALLY!!!!!!
"
"
I love this product and it seems to be the only hair care products that don't make my hair straight or wavy. I have naturally curly hair and I was looking for a product that would maintain those curls without me having to use gels or moose. This product did that and I absolutely love it! It also smells very good which is always a plus. The only downside that I find with this product is that it doesn't seem to make my hair very soft. I have VERY dry hair and these products don't seem to maintain the moisture in my hair, although my hair is very curly. I easily fixed this by applying some Moroccan oil after showering, so this really isn't that big of a problem. I definitely recommend this product for people who want naturally curly hair.
"
"
I am a guy with naturally curly hair. I do not like spending time on my hair or using any products other than shampoo and conditioner and I prefer using all natural. People always tell me my hair is my best feature and I really like this product. It does keep the curls and helps me be as absolutely lazy with my hair as I like to be. I literally don't even use a brush or a comb ever. I just wash and shake and let the curls do their thing. This is a great product for that.
"
"
This didn't work well on my hair. I felt like my hair was so much drier and more fragile after switching to DevaCurl. It made my hair look curlier, for sure, but a drier and frizzier curl than it was before. My ends are also in worse shape after my switch. I'm swapping back to the Tigi Bed Head Resurrection shampoo/conditioner duo. They're not specifically curly hair products, but they keep hair much more moisturized and healthy looking.

Mid-2014, beginning with No-Poo and One Condition samples and discovering a hairdresser who specializes in curly hair,* my hair waved and curled without frizz for the first time since I began puberty. Furthermore, my grey hair, obviously a different texture than my remaining black coffee-colored hair, isn't out of control anymore.  This packaging, Devacurl Original Kit with No-Poo and One Condition, 32 fl. oz., was the best buy I could find at the time of my initial purchase in March of 2015. Since I've been exclusively using these two products to clean/prepare for about three years, and my hair remains healthy and happy, today is a good time for an honest and complete review.When I began using Devacurl, my un-processed hair was just past my shoulders. Now, it's about halfway down my back. I was surprised to read reviews from people whose 32 oz. bottles didn't last that long.  (Of course, the conditioner is going a little faster, and I have always wondered why manufacturers don't make conditioner bottles a little bigger...!)I press down on the No-Poo pump most of the way a single time, lean over, and work the No-Poo through wet hair, starting at my scalp and going through my long hair. One pump's worth is all I need. (Scrunching all of my hair on top of my head as in shampoo TV commercials just tangles it.)  Without suds, I'm rinsing by feel, and my hair is quickly rinsed without any slimy residue. My hair is already beginning to curl.  I press on the One Conditioner pump a single time, working it through my hair the same way and paying extra attention to the lightest gray, which is around my face.  It sits for a few minutes, and then I rinse it out.  My hair feels soft and smooth.  These two 32-oz bottles (No-Poo and One, one each) are just emptying now, two years and five months later.The only product I use post-Devacurl is a cheap, homemade curling gel made by boiling flax seeds (a friend of mine found the procedure online and I've modified it to suit me) and adding a few drops of essential lavender because I like how it smells. If I need to run out, I've got some of the gel watered down in a spray bottle, which I keep in the fridge so that I can spritz my hair on my way out the door. Instant recoil.This past week, both a stranger in the local coffee shop and the file clerk in my attorney's office surprised me with compliments on my curly hair. I'd just left my house that morning without doing a thing beyond removing the ponytail scrunchie in which I sleep. (Running late that day, I'd even forgotten the flax seed gel spritz mentioned above.)I began using salon-quality products before Amazon.com, before Internet was available to the general public, and before specialty stores open only to hairdressers opened their door to all. That's a lot of time to try out a lot of shampoos and conditioners.  I have tried cheap products, mid-range products, and products that cost half a day's pay.Bottom line: I have found Devacurl to be the most affordable and the BEST product I have ever used._____*Yes, there are such specialists, and the lady we found in New Haven County, CT charges approximately what my friends pay at other, non-specializing salons. She is worth every penny. The other ladies in her salon, before I decided that only she will ever touch my hair, have only used Devacurl products on my hair. Furthermore, when I tell them that the only product I use is the homemade hair gel, they tell me that it's what their grandmas used.

Love love love this product! I have 3b curls. Lots of volume with a variety of different sized curls but not quite coily. Because I tend to have seborrheic dermatitis flare ups, I am not one of the people that can skip washing my hairOtherwise I get a lot of build up and flaking. This has worked the best for my hair and scalp by a long shot. Its soothing on my head and smells great! Leaves my hair feeling moisturized. I have tried the decadence line as well but it didn't do much for me. I did not find it moisturized more. Every curly head is different so it might work for someone else but I would definitely recommend this to someone with hair dryness or scalp issues.
"
"
I bought these as a recommendation from my hairstylist friend who swore this stuff would ease my frizzy/frail hair problems. and boy was she right!!! I have been using these for a few months now and my hair has never felt so healthy! My hair is naturally very fine/thin but now it feels way strong and nourished. I couldn't be any happier with this and will buy again and again.
"
"
Love this product.  Great for my hair and worked really well on my baby's curly hair, too.  Only problem, the shampoo majorly leaked in transit.  I know these things happen, but it was a bummer.
"
"
Great products. I won't continue to use them because I've found other products more suitable for me, but I definitely recommend this for anyone starting their curly girl method. The difference on my hair is amazing! I pair these up with the ultra-defining gel. As a 2B type, I was recommended the ArcAngel, but that product was not for me. The light defining gel worked just fine and it was very light, but I personally need more to get definition to say; which is why I switched gels. I may continue to use the ultra defining gel, because I love it so much! I leave most of the conditioner on post shower and scrunch in the gel as I go. On days 2 and 3 the hair tends to still look great if I use the pineapple technique for going to bed. If anything goes wrong, I recommend using the Mist-er Right or watered down conditioner to get your waves to wake up from their slumber.
"
"
LOVE these products. My curls are so healthy and full of life since switching to Deva Curl vs other brands I've used like Tresemme or Pantene. The large bottles last me about 8 months, and it's definitely worth the price for the quality (and I'm a server so I can't usually afford to splurge on expensive hair and beauty products.)
"
"
This product was recommended to me by a few moms of little girls with curly hair after I had asked what can I do to detangle my daughter's hair.  It was totally matted, no shine or body to it, no curls, just a total mess.  I received this product and first used it on myself.  I have straight hair, but it needs help too.  It worked great on me ... BUT, it worked miracles on my daughter.  Not only did her hair shine, NO knots, but I have never seen her curls look the way they did.  I did put a little conditioner in her hair as leave in as well.  I thought the smell was like Dove bar soap, which isn't bad ... and the smell diminishes once hair is dry.  I cannot say enough about this shampoo and conditioner.  My daughter's hair is very coarse, very dry, very knotty ... and this product is truly a miracle.
"
"
It has changed my life and my hair of course. If you have any type of curly hair, STOP using soaps that make a lot of foam because it dries up your hair making it frizzy. Look at the ingredients too. This made my hair so smooth and nourished. Also, read the instructions to get it right.
"
"
Do Not Buy!! Used on 3 different heads of curls and this product made them all feel dry and brittle after the wash. The conditioner did not help. Waste of money.
"
"
I couldn't believe it when I washed my hair the very first time, my hair looked and felt like it just got a cold gallon of water when it was lost in the desert. My hair was very dry and frizzy. It was impossible for me to ever leave my hair out and natural after all the years of flat ironing (shudders). This gave me such a confidence boost that I started recommending this along with ANgel to any one who had no love for their curly hair. These products has me looking at people with straight hair like ""what the heck did I ever see in straightening???"". Now I get people looking at ME and wishing they had my hair. I WAS born with it and it's definitely not maybelline.
"
"
I love love love love the no poo and the conditioner . I relaxed my hair last year with a mild cold relaxer so my hair is halve curly (3b/3c) and halve Relaxed. I v been Using these duo for a month along with ultra defining gel plus a weekly silicone free deep conditioner and my curls are back and my hair is unbelievably soft and bouncy . great product and I strongly recommend 😊
"
"
After I shampoo my hair and rinsing it thoroughly. I put the conditioner in my hair and I don't wash it out I either can style my hair or let my hair dry.  my hair is gorgeous curly or flat ironed it's a great product.
"
"
I have been converted!! I've been using normal shampoo and conditioners all my life and could never understand why my hair was so frizzy and curls so flat. Now my curls are soft with minimal frizz (I would say none but the second day gets a little tricky which is not this products fault; I just haven't learned how to take care of them yet). I've told everyone I know about these products because I love them so much!!
"
"
I love how soft it makes my hair! I was using Kinky Curly( and I still love it), but it makes my hair too crunchy. But definitely will be repurchasing DevaCurl! Oh and by the way if you have any coupons please email me some because it is a little expensive!
"
"
This stuff is amazing. I got a sample of DevaCurl in a Birchbox long ago, but didn't receive enough to determine if it was really any good. I've recently decided to move towards the ""no-poo"" movement, mostly because I have very long, fine, wavy, dry, colored, difficult to manage hair and washing it is a pain in the you-know-what. I also wanted a healthier, sustainable hair care option. I wash my hair once a week. Enter: DevaCare. I decided to try this instead of DevaCurl because my hair is more wavy and is also colored. Plus, the combo pack with the conditioner was a steal. I can tell these bottles will last me months. I use so little product compared to previous brands, and it goes so far. Especially the conditioner!!  The smell is lightly reminiscent of orange, but not overpowering. It rinses out easily and leaves my hair feeling so soft. I don't have tangles after the shower anymore!!! I was worried these would leave my hair slightly oily since they're so moisturizing, but I can still go a week after washing without any problems - maybe just a little dry shampoo now and then. If you're thinking about switching...do it! You'll be so pleased. I do recommend washing less often than normal if you are a frequent washer. This shampoo/conditioner will allow you to do that, but you have to let your hair adjust to it which may take a couple of weeks (shorter for me because I already washed so infrequently). Buy some!!:)
"
"
I love this stuff! My hair smells good, my curls are bouncy, I am so glad I purchased.EDIT 9.12.16 - I have to edit my review, this leaves product buildup in my hair like no other - probably due to the lack of shampoo. Even though the curls are bouncy, I feel the buildup on my scalp isn't worth it.
"
"
I have purchased this product from devacurl website. But since its available on amazon i made this  purchase and i regret it.It seems to be different.My hair looks dry n frizzy and i have a lot of hairfall.I suggest you make the purchase on the devacurl website.Definitely its not same.
"
"
I recently reviewed the decadence DevaCare , I got this one and that one mixed up . Decadence conditioner is a little heavy for my fine hair , this one is perfect . Please read other review , Sorry  I tried to go back and edit but I was not able to . The other product is good but a little heavy for fine hair.  This one is the one I use , for the rest of my curly headed life. Absolutely LOVE IT !!
"

This is the only ""shampoo"" and conditioner set I can use with my curls. This is a great deal, too. I've found that the pumps that come with these are hard to use, sometimes the head (the part you press down on) doesn't pop away from the rest of it so you just can't use it. I purchased two pumps from Ulta for very cheap and I use those instead of dealing with the pumps on these.You might be tempted to use a LOT of the conditioner if you're used to traditional conditioners that have silicone products in them. These don't have silicone (better for your curls!) so they won't give you that ""greasy"" sort of feeling that you'd otherwise get. We've been conditioned (no pun intended) to equate that greasy feeling with the conditioner ""nourishing"" your hair...but that's not what it's doing (at least not because of that greasy feeling). One Condition doesn't have silicone in it so it doesn't build up on your scalp. Cover your hair in it and you're good to go, adding more will not get you the greasy feeling you're used to. You'll readjust to how a conditioner SHOULD feel on your curls soon enough, don't worry :)For after the shower, squeeze off excess water from your hair and wrap a cotton t-shirt around it (terrycloth = frizz) and squeeze your curls, trying to keep their shape together. I highly recommend spraying in Deva Curl's Set It Free, scrunching in their Styling Cream, and using a small bit of their Light Defining Gel to finish off your curls. Try not to touch them too much while your hair is drying!!! When dry, you'll want to scrunch them up to your scalp to kind of ""release"" the curls and maybe flip your head and shake them out to get some more volume going. The less you touch, the less frizz you'll have!

Love this product. Leaves my curls feeling hydrated and manageable. No more frizz. I use with the styling gel and I don’t feel the need to always throw my hair in a bun because it isn’t cooperating. It does have a strong scent, but I like it.
"
"
I have curly hair and have had lots of frizz lately so I started on a search for a product line that would take away the frizz and leave me with well defined curls. This is it finally! After trying 4 other brands I found it! The No-poo can be weird if you have never used it. No suds so how can it clean? It works great! When I used to comb my hair following a wash I would get a small handful of hair in my comb - now just a tiny few! I woul absolutely recommend this product and already have to a fw curly haired girlfriends!

These products made me lose my hair by chunks !!! In less than 2 months I was bald on the sides . The amount of hair that I was a ball as big as the palm of my hand. Notice the dates on the picture. I bought the products December 7th  By mid January was even worst
"
"
My daughter's a curly-top and everything else ""fries"" her hair.  She loves this brand, though, and it makes her hair look great!
"
"
I was visiting some friends overnight and used this in the shower. It was astoundingly good for my very long straight  thinning hair. It made it thick and lustrous and smooth. It just felt so good and looked so good. Shampoo and conditioner can do this? I thought it was all hype!  It's advertised for thick and curly hair (hmmm?). It's expensive and I have been strictly a cheapest shampoo in the aisle shopper for years, but I bought this stuff because it was remarkable for three days after washing.
"
"
I used to love deva curl products, but suddenly when I started these new bottles my scalp became itchy and sore, and I started losing a lot more hair than normal. I looked up the company to see if ingredients had changed, and I found that many other people are having the same issues after the company changed hands. I hate that I wasted so much money on something that ruined my hair.
"
"
It arrived damaged. The cleanser exploded all over and I lost some of the product. I was still able to use it though, and boy does this make a world of difference for my curls. I won’t use anything else, I’ve tried everything!
"
"
I used to love this set. In the bringing my hair shiny soft and full of bounce. After 2 years my hair is thinning. I lose big piles of hair every time I shower. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! OVER TIME IT WILL DESTROY YOUR CURLS!!!
"
"
Absolutely love it !!  And don't forget the detangler ...and gel.  I've been using Deva products for about a year.  I've tried for years (decades) to get these kind of curls !!  AND when I don't want to wash my hair ... just a little water and a comb (or detangler) and you are ready for the day!Really love the compliments I get !!
"
"
I love the product but after the last conditioner pump wouldn't expand/open/pump - I waited a year to buy it again. I figured the defect would be fixed by now. Nope. Conditioner bottle still doesn't pump - so I have to pull the pump out and pour conditioner on my hand to use. The bottle is heavy so it's not easy - and water gets in and dilutes the conditioner.will wait another year to buy again. Maybe then.
"
"
This is the best dia I have ever tried in my hair. I have been using it for two years now and these big bottles last for about ten months. I have long hair but only wash it every three days. It’s with the price!! I buy it once a year and my hair is always soft, shiny and healthy.
"
"
This was not good quality Deva Curl product.  I don't know what happened but it is cream color instead of white and came out of the bottle thick.  I have used this shampoo and conditioner for -0 years and I've never seen anything like this.I wish I used this sooner so I could return it.  $50 down the drain!
"
"
Love this stuff! Only shampoo and conditioner I’ll use. Great for curly hair and smells good.
"
"
My husband has very coarse thick curly hair and he wears it shoulder length (usually tied up). He's very low maintenance and he doesn't have the patience to use a lot of products. This is why deva products are great. His hair is healthy, soft and moisturized all with just the shampoo conditioner and cream gel.
"
"
Since I started using this product along with other DevaCurl products my hair began to thin out. I originally attributed it to stress from work but for the last couple of months my hair has been falling out almost in clumps. I’ve immediately started using all devacurl products and now the hair loss is not as severe. I now have to find a way to restore my once beautiful head of curls.
"
"
I've been using the Deva Curl LOW Poo Original shampoo.  This product- NO POO Original shampoo has a different scent, consistency and smells chemically.  My mistake, but totally different scent, consistency than the LOW Poo Original.Still on the fence about moisturizing and softness
"
"
If you have curly hair, you will love this! It goes on like a conditioner or cream rinse  because it doesn't get sudsy. And as soon as you rinse it you will feel the difference! It takes a little getting used to but once you do you won't want anything else! As for the conditioner it's okay I usually use Pantene but decided to give this a try . Probably won't buy it again but I will continue to buy the no poo shampoo forever...
"
"
Deva curl isn’t the same. I noticed it does not wash off the hair products I used in the morning for example the mousse and hairspray. My hair feels hard and stiff. My brush gets stuck in my hair. I loved deva curl when the bottles were $30 but now that the price went up I feel like we are getting jipped. Disappointed. The conditioner isn’t the same. Poor quality.
"
"
I absolutely LOVE these products. I had been trying out different sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners since September 2011. I am happy to say these products are now my staple products for cleansing and conditioning my naturally curly hair (curl pattern 3b). Here's why:- they contain healthy ingredients for my naturally curly hair (type 3b),- they smell very refreshing like rosemary or peppermint,- the conditioner has enough slip to easily finger-detangle my curly hair,- the conditioner can be used as a leave-in conditioner,- the conditioner can be used for co-washing,- they cleanse and condition my hair very well,- they are part of the CG (curly girl) method,- they leave my hair clean and well moisturized, and lastly,- they do exactly what they're intended to do!If you are new to being natural, you should definitely try these products as they cater to curly and natural hair types. They are worth the money! Of course, you are going to go through your conditioner faster than your cleanser. I would also recommend using a leave-in conditioner.*For more information, visit my YouTube channel: Dpayne8 [...]

I bought this from my so's prime account in anticipation of using this sooner. I was fully expecting to have moisturized, defined hair when I got this product in the mail. I don't know if this is a different product repackaged as Devacurl, but it dried out my hair horribly!! It feels like straw and I am extremely disappointed. All this money for a horrible product.
"
"
I spent my entire life hating my hair. It was big. frizzy. untameable. I constantly had the 'lampshade effect' (flat on top, blown out at the bottom, you fellow curly girls will know what I mean). I have long corkscrew curly hair and I was never satisfied with it. It turns out, that was because I didn't know anything about it.All that changed when I read the Curly Girl book. I started to understand my hair, what makes it different from straight hair and what I'd been doing wrong all my life that made my hair such an unmanageable, unattractive mess. Once I read the book, and understood my hair (and all the ways that it's different from straight hair) I started to love it. So when I found Deva Curl and saw that it's made by the same people who wrote the Curly Girl book, I knew I had to have it.I'll never go back to another product. Immediatly, the very first time, I felt a difference in the texture and softness of my hair. I love the citrusy-mint smell. I love the clean tingly feeliing and most of all, I love how shiny, healthy and bouncy my hair is. Read the book, buy this product. You'll never go back to hating your hair again.
"
"
I’ve been using this shampoo and conditioner combo for years. It really works well to clean and moisturize my curly hair. I can even leave a small amount of the conditioner in for continued smoothness
"
"
Love this. Weird no suds, but my curly hair is softer and more manageable than it has ever been. Will not go back to suds again. Also I do not use the nopoo every time,just the conditioner. If your hair is curly or dry and damaged try this product. Also very gentle color treated hair. My color lasts a  week longer and the color does not fade with this product. :)
"
"
My hair is falling out. I’m shedding a lot. I lose a fist full of hair in every washing and I find strands on my clothes during the day. This is not how my hair was before. It started out lustrous and bouncy but now it’s thin and straggly. There’s a big controversy right now about DevaCurl products. I don’t feel safe using them anymore.
"
"
I absolutely love the way my hair looks with the DevaCurl Products. I have very thick hair with a little wavy and it gets very frizzy if I do not blow-dry and straighten (which takes an hour)...Now thanks to my new products I can have beautiful curly curly hair in a few minutes. Saves me soooo much time and I love these products.
"
"
I began useing this product under the recommendation of my stylist. My first purchase was at her salon, but i began doubting I could afford such prices that were displayed at the establishment. So i searched Amazon, and found this deal.At my salon, one No-Poo and one One-Condition costs $41, both bottles are 12 oz. Here, same products in 32 oz bottles.I'll tell you right now, i'd rather pay $16 more than $66! Plus, i finally have a product that won't make a mess of my curly hair!
"
"
Deva curl is a great product for curly hair, I have a good hair day every time I use their products.
"
"
I have very dry, curly hair. I've tried everything! I started using this product last week and I love it!! I used to have to use at least three products ie leave in, mousse, serum, etc just to get a semi decent look with frizz control. No all I use is the No Poo cleanser, conditioner and gel. My curls are soft and frizz free. I also bought their towel and clips. Wonderful product, will definitely be buying again! Highly recommend!!
"
"
I've had it a few days, and I love it! My curls are voluminous and shiny looking, and the coconut cream in addition to the no-poo and conditioner seems to do the trick. No issues. The product was thick and it does smell a little strange, but it isn't bad.
"
"
DevaCurl does wonders for my curls. Truthfully, I only use the No-Poo once or twice a week, but condition daily.
"
"
This product is not a true Deva curl product in my opinion. My hair is frizzy and weighed down since I started using this product. I have never dealt with this problem when buying the Deva curl from Ulta or an actual salon. And when I received it half of the conditioner had leaked out all over the packaging. Very disappointed.
"
"
My entire family loves this product. And the price is far better than purchasing it in a salon. In a salon each bottle is $40, we bought these two for $58 and didn't have to pay sales tax or shipping since we have Prime. That's a great deal!
"
"
Great no-sulfate and silicone free products. My husband has thick, straight, course, porous hair and this is the only shampoo/conditioner we've ever found that makes his hair behave itself. ""Conventional"" shampoos make his hair look like straw and stand on end. We originally bought it for me, (I have baby fine, thick, wavy/curly, non-porous hair) but it's too heavy for regular use. I use Acure Organics Moroccan Argan Oil + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo & Conditioner.
"
"
This came quickly! It was great. I am not a huge fan of the smell of the conditioner (personally, others might!). I may use the regular Deva Curl conditioner next time. however the product works really well. I have really curly hair and have such a hard time finding a conditioner that hydrates well and will detangle-- this works!
"
"
Love my curls with these products. Also recommend the gel. Makes curls defined and soft unlike crunchy mousse.
"
"
I have a mixture of curly and wavy hair (3a and 2c for the nerds who know). I've been using DevaCurl NoPoo and One Condition for about three months, now, and it has increased the definition, spring and shine of my curls, converting a lot of what used to just be waves to curls. Drying method is super important though -- make sure you hang upside down and scrunch a lot of the water out, then dry with an old t-shirt to maximize your results. I finish with a mixture of B&B Curl Conscious Curl Calming Creme and a little bit of DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel.
"
"
It's been a little difficult getting use to the ""no poo"" I like a good lather and before this product I used ""lo poo"" and after a couple of weeks using this one I've decided that when its time to buy Deva Care shampoo again I'll go back to lo poo, hands down so much better for me. Great product though!
"
"
Excellent product. My wife has been using for years and raves about it. Amazon price was MUCH better than other retailers she had been purchasing from...
"
"
It's taken a long time to find a good wash and conditioner for my hair.  I recommend this to anyone who has naturally curly hair and is looking for a product that won't dry you out.  I have been so much happier with the way my hair looks and feels since week one of using this product and I'm going on two years now.
"
"
I've been using this product for years and love it in general. However, the version that I purchased here smelled ""off"" and doesn't work like it normally does. Buying elsewhere from now on.
"
"
I have long curly hair. This product did not clean or detangle my hair to my satisfaction. I was very disappointed, as it came highly recommended by my stylist. I ended up throwing away mostly full bottles
"
"
Love the product and this is much more affordable than going to the stores for the value sizes.
"
"
I’m really loving the cleanser! The conditioner is great better than any conditioner I’ve tried, just wish the conditioner de tangled a little more, I have corkscrew curls. I will buy again!
"
"
While nore expensive than other products, I believe worth it! These products have kept my hair in good shape despite regular highlighting and color. They also promote the natural waviness and curl of my hair. I won’t use anything else.
"
"
Works well to hold color longer. It takes some getting use to - not having foaming, soapy shampoo, but if you can handle that, this is super gentle on your hair and my fine hair is never weighed down by it. The only thing this is missing, is that I don't feel like it does anything for scalp health. I think it might be worthwhile to use something else a few days a week for that.
"
"
The product (conditioner) smells drastically different than what I've purchased at a salon or Ulta, almost like lime or men's aftershave.  It has also caused skin breakouts on my forehead that I've never experienced.  When I told the seller about this they literally said, ""hope next time you have a better buying experience.""  It won't be thru them, for sure.
"
"
Nothing has worked better on my hair. I'm usually in a rush out the door, so an extensive list of hair products is something I would love to avoid. Thankfully, I only use the no poo and one condition. Also, these products do not irritate the scalp whatsoever or leave residue in your hair, so it remains soft yet voluminous all day. I'm waiting for summer when it gets quite humid in San Antonio to see how it holds up, but the odds are that it will. Lastly, I'm saving hella dollars on this than buying any form of drugstore conditioner that my hair will eat up instantly.
"
"
Product seems different from the one I purchased from the beauty  supply. Quality is not good
"
"
This might be the best hair-care product I've ever bought just because of price alone. Yeah, it's around 60 bucks but I've been using this stuff for 6 months and the bottle is only half empty. I can get a full year out of these. You could be paying approximately 5 bucks a month for shampoo and conditioner that works so much better than the other brands. You pay probably $10 a month for the regular stuff. This will save you so much money if you use these bottles sparingly (I wash my hair every other day).As far as how well these products work, I am always pleased. My scalp tends to get dry and flakey but my stylist told me to always rinse the conditioner off of my scalp and add some conditioner to the tips of my hair to keep the moisture where it's needed. I feel like how I feel when I come out of the salon every time I wash my hair.This is a must buy.
"
"
Great product for my daughter who has extremely thick curly hair.  Don't use too much product as a leave in condition  as it will feel sticky and pasty!  If you use the leave in conditioner make sure the hair is wet and only use a little bit. At least that's my opinion with my daughter's hair! Great product though!
"
"
**UPDATE** I really wanted to love this product because I loved the way my hair felt after washing it and I LOVED the smell of all the products BUT!...I lost SO MUCH HAIR using this product.  If you read my review below where I state the loss of my hair, well it continued.  I stopped using the product made my own shampoo using Coconut Milk Cream and a few other oils and tiny bit of baking soda and used Apple Cider Vinegar as my conditioner and a few months later, my hair is slowly growing back and getting longer.I showed my girlfriend at work my hair one morning after washing it and she couldn't believe how much hair I'd lost, she apologized over and over because she introduce it to me but I explained it was not her fault, there may be something in there that just does not agree with my system and makes my hair fall out by the clumps.  Anyway, by accident I came across their salon in my city and met a stylist that asked me to have them look at my hair and allow them to do my hair.  I appreciate the offer but, there is no way, I'm letting this product touch my hair that is slowly growing back.  It doesn't seem to affect my friend and it may not affect yours either but if you start to see a lot of your hair fall-out, stop using it immediately.**Original Review**I originally purchased the travel set and loved the smell and feel of my hair after shampooing and conditioning it.  Also, because you only wash your hair once or twice a week with this product, the travel set lasted me nearly a month and gave me an opportunity to try the No-Poo, Conditioner, Light Defining Gel and Set it Free.Pros:-Paraben, Silicone and Sulfate Free-Love the smell of the product line, fresh hair smell-Compliments on my hair-Specifically designed for curly to wavy hair (mine has both)- The way my hair feels after shampooing, not dry or stripped-The size of the 2 Liter Duo and that Pump they come with-The fact that my hair and scalp still smell good between washesCons:-Glycerin, it doesn't state that it is plant-based so I have to assume it is animal Glycerin-The Cost, pretty expensive-The amount of hair I lose when I wash it (wash it once to twice a week)I've actually had someone say that they could smell my hair when I walked into their office and it smelled really good (same person that turned me on to this product, they have curly hair too). Thanks D! :)However, I'm still trying to get used to not washing my hair every other day; 5 days is the longest I've gone and could not believe my hair and scalp still smelled nice!However, I am now back to washing it every 3-4 days because any longer, the amount of hair I see loosing in the shower terrifies me but I believe it's because I am not combing it the days I don't wash it.  I just spray a little more water and the finishing setter that smells good and scrunch it more to set my curls again.I ordered the gel again and waiting for it to arrive.  I will continue using this until I come close to running out before I make my final decision about making this a permanent part of my routine. :)
"
"
I felt that I had to use a lot of the shampoo to get my hair to feel clean, keep that in mind if you are used to shampoos that lather, really liked the conditioner though, both have a pleasant smell!
"
"
I absolutely ADORE these products. My hair used to be extremely frizzy and unmanageable. I've also died my hair a billion times so it's very damaged. This shampoo and conditioner makes it possible for me to wear my hair curly and it actually look good! I love love love it!
"
"
Bought for my curly haired daughter. She is embracing her curls and is in love with DevaCurl products.
"
"
Love how creamy DevaCare products are! The DevaCare cleanser and conditioner are so creamy however that I can't dispense the product via the white caps. I always have to unscrew the cap to squeeze out product. This product also has a stronger scent than the DevaCurl products which is a nice fruity scent. My hair color didn't fade as bad with the DevaCare vs DevaCurl product.
"
"
Really didn't think the poo and conditioner were necessary.  But they are for me  It really makes a difference in my hair.  I have used wen and sally's one for a while.  This is better for my type hair.  My natural curly hair is graying and chemically colored.  Fine in texture, porous and I have a lot of hair.  If I look at rain it frizzes.
"
"
Best for curls without frizz!
"
"
My sister turned me on to DevaCurl products ~3 years ago and I have been using them ever since.  I did have to get used to not having the lather effect when washing my hair as well as not feeling that it was ""squeaky clean"" but no worries. With DevaCurl products, my hair stays clean longer and the curls are more pronounced (which means the frizz has diminished significantly).  I buy the larger sized containers and tend to combine the products as it is more economical to do that.
"
"
I was hoping for good things with this cleanser and conditioner but I am extremely disappointed. It has made my hair very dry and it was a total waste of my money. Now I have to spend more money on another shampoo and conditioner. Do not buy this product if you are hoping for a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
Was really looking forward to this but the item came broken and the conditioner was spilled everywhere. I like this product but was super disappointed that this happened I can’t even close the top of it all the way so it will keep on spilling. This is pretty expensive so I save for this to help my hair. Be aware of this there has been reviews similar to this before.
"
"
I love this product. I am inept at doing my hair. But with this product and the gel my hair looks fabulous without much effort. My hair is wonderful finally!! Seriously look at the result.
"
"
I Love DevaCurl!! Has restored my curly hair after 20 years of damage!!! I cannot speak enough about this product. Glad to find a big size of the No Poo and Conditioner! Super fast shipping and good packaging, would buy again!
"
"
Makes my curls razzle dazzle!!  Fairly non-toxic according to the Environmental Working Group's beauty and cosmetic's buying guide.  I can't wash my hair with anything else.  I actually don't think I can live without DevaCurl.  I'm a DevaGuy.  =)
"
"
I try to aoid lathering products because I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out or break out. Same goes for my hair and scalp. My hair always feels very clean and dries much smoother with these products that even sulphate free lathering formulas. It's been about a year and a half and I am still hooked. I like the Deva Care just as much as Deva Curl- maybe more, as it seems more hydrating.
"
"
I have been hooked on DevaCurl for years. It might seem weird to not ""shampoo"" your hair, since this product does  not produce suds, but I swear, your hair will be clean, and your curls will be awesome.One note- you really should not brush/comb curly hair after you get out of the shower. I had a hard time getting this through my head. Then, I started combing my hair while the conditioner was still on my hair in the shower. Then I rinsed it out and did not comb my hair when I got out of the shower. If you do this, your hair will curl much nicer as it dries. Trust me. Don't comb it after you shower. AND don't wrap your hair in a towel. Just squeeze it out really well, and wrap a towel around your shoulder if your hair keeps dripping. Again, your hair will curl better, with much less frizz.Try it....I hope it works for you, too!
"
"
I have straight fine hair that was dry and sad.  The products have helped somewhat but just started using.
"
"
This is my favorite hair car product, I have wavy/curly-ish fly away hair and I love this product and how it enhances curls and helps control the fly aways!  Will purchase again and again!
"
"
Terrible. Leaves hair filmy. Doesn’t work for me at all. Will never buy again.
"
"
My hair is like... completely new hair since I've started using DevaCurl products! My curly hair used to be brittle and frizzy, and I used to HATE wearing it down because I was so embarrassed of how poofy my hair would be. I now use Deva No Poo and One Condition in the shower, and then put a quarter-sized dollop of the Coconut Deva Cream in my palm after I get out of the shower and apply that to my wet hair, and my hair always comes out SO NICELY!! It has such a nice shine and bounce to it :)You can also add more of the coconut Deva cream to dry hair if your hair is still frizzy after it dries.Long story short, Deva Curl has changed my life! I no longer hate wearing my hair down and no longer use my hair straightener to get rid of my curls :)
"
"
I have been using this product for a while now I introduced it to my grandaughter and she loves this product she has curly soft curls and now they are super curly and so soft you can play with her hair so when she is almost out she reminds me to order love the product and will continue to purchase
"
"
These are my go to products for curls!  Any ladies with curly hair I would strongly recommend these products!
"
"
Absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner I've found for curly hair.You've got to try deva curls hairdryer. AMAZING
"
"
Best decision I have made for my hair is trying out this product! The curly girl method is my hairs best friend. I have type 3a hair and this is just the right amount of clean and moisture.
"
"
Love the stuff
"
"
I love this product but watch the shipping from this supplier. The shampoo had leaked everywhere. Lid was not tight and they were not taped closed. I would have returned it if I wasn’t totally out. Now I only have 3/4 of a bottle of the shampoo.
"
"
This is the best smelling shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. The smell is great and it keeps your hair smelling great for several days after washing. I use it whether I am going to go curly or straight because it is just great for gentle cleaning and helping reduce the frizzies.
"
"
The shampoo has a slightly minty smell that I like. It doesn't foam and I'm surprised that I don't miss the foam. I know it's missing all those nasty chemicals that would damage my color-treated hair. It gets my hair clean and leaves it silky even without the conditioner. But I use the conditioner every time I shampoo and it makes my hair manageable and shiny. Great duo.
"
"
Thank you for the fast shipping. Exactly what I needed and delivered quickly. This is a ""couldn't live without"" product, always makes my curls soft and manageable. Will buy over and over.
"
"
Shampoo doesn't smell that great, but conditioner does. I bleach my hair regularly and I have had many compliments on how healthy and moisturized my hair looks since switching to this shampoo. I haven't noticed a huge difference in my curls though.
"
"
The products arrived and I'll use both, but the bottle of Deva Curl No Poo is actually a mis-labeled bottle of Deva Curl One Condition, so you're actually getting two bottles of One condition. Having used Deva Curl products for years, I know that No Poo has a different smell, color, and consistency than One Condition. The factory where the products were labeled must have produced a substantial amount incorrectly as I've found the same issue at a few beauty supply stores that carry the products as well.
"
"
Works great! Tons leaked out in delivery and I messaged amazon and deva curl and never got any $ back.
"
"
I love devacurl and feel it has made my hair much healthier, but when I received the product, I realized most of the product had spilled from the cap into the plastic package it was wrapped in. I usually don't complain when things like that happen because I understand that these things happen during delivery, but because of how expensive the product is I was rather disappointed. Perhaps instead of packaging the shampoo and conditioner with the pumps in place, they could use regular caps and just include the pumps, that could maybe help it from not spilling out. I will definitely buy this product again, just from a different seller.
"
"
I've had my first super curly, pixie cut--sort of like Halle Berry or Toni Braxton  =) since Dec.2014.  This product is easy to use, wonderful scent, best deal is on Amazon.  I payed more at the salon for the 8oz. bottles just to try it out; haven't been disappointed yet.  The hair gel is magical too!  Amazon had the best price for the32oz hair gel also.
"
"
The cleanser bottle top was broken.  Only about 1/2 cup was lost.  Decided not to send back.  I love the product.  I am white with long somewhat curly hair.  I color my hair.  This is the only product that does not make my hair feel dry after washing.  Thank you.
"
"
My curly hair has never been prettier. I'll never use another shampoo.  I went on a work trip and decided to not bring the bottles because I didn't have room. There was a visible difference when I didn't use this shampoo.  I couldn't wait to come home !
"
"
Great products.  I started using the DevaCurl products including the shampoo and conditioner, then had a hair appointment/consultation at a salon with a DevaCurl trained stylist and get much better results now with the instruction I received from the stylist than I had prior.  I'd strongly recommend seeing a DevaCurl trained stylist if possible in your area as the use of the products is very different than what I had been doing for my curly hair previously.  The DevaCurl book might be enough if you can't see a stylist locally, but the way they recommend using the products is completely different than how I'd ever styled my hair before.  You shampoo (takes a while to get used to no lather), then apply much more conditioner than I ever had before, barely rinse the conditioner out with cold water (to keep the cuticle of the hair closed), and then apply the styling products with your hair still dripping wet before ""scrunching"" with a microfiber towel or t-shirt fabric.  Also new to this styling regimen, I don't ever brush my hair anymore, and it somehow looks nice with smooth curls and isn't full of dreadlocks.  Anyway - very happy with these products and other DevaCurl styling products I've tried and won't be going back to my old routine anytime soon.

This stuff is amazing.  My curls were popping!! The product arrived right on time, and it was cheaper through amazon.  I purchased it at a department store for almost the same price but it was only 12 fl oz bottles and here I got 32 FL oz.  It has lasted me so much longer. I would recommend buying it.  I know I am!☺️
"
"
This product seems to have a different formula than the ones I've received before. The texture and smell are different and the product does not work well with detangling my hair.
"
"
I have never use this product before and I heard amazing things about it, so I decided to give it a try. However, I am not sure if it is because it may be fake or is just the product but I haven't noticed anything amazing on my hair. The smell is not that strong and my scalp gets itchy.
"
"
I'm just now reading the reviews (after I purchased and used the product.) I have heard so many amazing things about DevaCurl so I decided to give it a try.  I read an article about drugstore products and products online not being the ""true"" product because they often times add alcohol to the product to dilute it.  I used this product and ever since, I have a spot on the back of my head that is severely dry and I cannot get it to go away.  I am very disappointed. I see a lot of other customers had product missing and faithful DevaCurl customers do not believe it is the same after they have used it.
"

Product came in damaged but box was not damaged.

I have curly hair naturally, which I've spent most of my life straightening because I hate it.  I've tried to go no-poo before and embrace the curls.  I've tried other brands of no-poo, brands of no sulfates but that still lathered.  I've tried very hard to embrace my curls with no luck.  I've resisted buying Deva Curl because it's just so darn expensive.  I finally broke down and ordered it and committed to really giving it the good old college try.  I've been using it now for a few weeks and I think I've finally found what I need to like my curls.  The frizziness is gone.  I also have kind of half curly, half wavy hair that always just looks like I slept on it.  These products have improved the condition of my hair to such an extent that it's curling more, and actually looks like something someone might do to their hair on purpose.  Letting my curls be is *so much less work* than blowing it out and straightening, and I'm thrilled to finally have found something that will work for me.
"
"
Love this product but got two bottles of No-Poo when I ordered one & one conditioner. Didn't notice until after I started using one bottle so it was too late to exchange it.  Double check.  I have ordered this set for years & this is the first time it has happened.
"
"
This product works really well, especially if you follow the advice of your Devachan stylist. Smells great, keeps curls bouncy, and will improve hair over time! For best results with this product, you'll have to stop using products with silicones and sulfates.
"
"
I love the Deva Curl products and have ordered them regularly from Amazon with no problems! However, today, this is how my shampoo and conditioner arrived! 😩
"
"
love it
"
"
the devacurl system has made a world of difference in my curly hair. I never realized how curly my hair was until I started treating it right. These bottles have so far lasted me 10 months and I won't be running out any time soon.
"
"
I can’t say enough about this product, it has changed the quality of my curly hair.  Highly recommend this product to anyone with curly hair!
"
"
These SMELL wonderful, I'm using them on my 21 months young and 3 year old sons extra curly hair. It does take a lot when I use it though.
"
"
Not a fan of this product. The fragrance smells like potpourri I'd find stashed in my grandmothers house.  It made my hair brittle and broke off. Dissapointed in the cost, smelln and overall product.
"
"
Seemed to be the real deal, and very gentle on hair. Deva conditioners don't have a lot of slip imo, but love the smell and that they don't leave my hair weighted down, even though I do use a little as a leave-in at the end. No poo is no lather, but seems to be just what my scalp wants.
"
"
Arrived exploded and leaked through packaging it came in. Recently discovered that after purchasing a new bottle of one condition that I have been losing more hair in the shower and my frizziness is worse after wash day. Trying out new products for sure.
"
"
My daughter and I have both have curly hair, and we finally found a product that it is perfect for our hair type.  All the commercials and product you see on TV and elsewhere is targeted to straight hair.  This product is great and it is not harsh for your hair.
"
"
My favorite product!!!  Excellent for curls!
"
"
Way too much alcohol and too drying
"
"
This stuff literally dried out my hair so bad that I have spent weeks trying to rehydrate my curls. I have bleached my hair, dyed it, toned it, stripped it and nothing has left it feeling as straw like and frizzed out and dry as these devacurl products.
"
"
This works great for my 3b/c curls!
"
"
I originally purhcased my DevaCurl products straight from the salon that cuts my hair. I ordered these when I ran out as they were such a good deal. This seller sent me the old formulation of the One Condition, which contains silicones, and all that other crap, and is a much thinner consistency, and has a terrible reeking perfume smell. My hair doesn't behave like it did when I used the legit deva one condition I got from my salon. The no-poo and arc angel is the same though. Wish I could just return the one conditon or get the recent formula sent :(
"
"
Every curly girl should be a Deva Curl girl. I have 3B curls and switched over to Deva Curl about 9 months ago and I have never regretted it. The No Poo shampoo is perfect for the cold/dry weather months in MI and keeps my hair clean but moisturized. The One Condition conditioner is great and I don't need to use as much as I used to with other products since the No Poo shampoo is so moisturizing. In the summer months I switch to the Lo Poo shampoo - still moisturizing but with MI humidity I need something that cleanses but doesn't add as much moisture to my hair as the No Poo. For my daily routine I combine Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner with Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner and then Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel. My hair stays soft and my curls stay perfectly corkscrewed. I wasn't a big fan of Deva Curl's B'Leave In Curl Boost and Volumizer only because it caused me to have white dusty stuff flake off of my hair. Otherwise it held my curls well and made my hair soft, but the white dusty stuff was annoying. If you are a curly girl at your wits end with all of the terrible products out there that do nothing for curly hair, I suggest trying Deva Curl. Get the trial sizes first so you can figure out what works best for your type of hair. As long as there is Deva Curl on the market, I don't think I'll ever use any other products (except for my Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner because that stuff is also great)!
"
"
Love the product- shipping not so great. Received exploded bottles. Better off buying in person.
"
"
honestly, my coworkers raved about this product/brand and i decided to purchase it....what a complete failure. I really thought it would be really great for my hair due to how expensive it was and how many good reviews i saw, but i am dissatisfied to say the least.
"
"
1. Product arrived on time.2. I don't know if it is the newest formula but all ingredients on both bottles correspond to the one I have bought right from ULTA.3. Both bottles not full as if someone used it and returned it.4. Will purchase from a more reputable seller next time.
"
"
Excellent price for the combo pack. I will get again! If you haven't tried Deva Curl and have curly hair I highly recommend it. Watch the you tube videos on how to get the most out of these when styling.
"
"
I have permed damage hair, this product helped (covered) the damage my hair is now much softer and manageable.
"
"
""NO POO"" is great... the conditioner smells awesome, but I am not sure that it's any more effective than any other conditioner. I will continue to buy the set since I think the cleanser is worth it.
"
"
Excellent!
"
"
This product is great, Deva Curl is the only product I use. I have natural curly hair and I have in the past,t tried other products, however, nothing is as good as Deva Curl.
"
"
Great product! Hair feel silky and smell great!
"
"
Less expensive to buy here than directly from Deva Curl or even from Ulta and CVS. The pumps are really handy too. Love Deva Curl Products.
"
"
STOP. UPPING. THE. PRICE!!!WAS 55, THEN 63, THEN 68, AND NOW 79?? WHAT THE HELL?
"
"
This is the best product for curly hair girls.  My curls love the hydration these products give.  The money spent is worth it and product will last long time
"
"
Showed up broken and leaking
"
"
This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner for my dry curly hair. The NoPoo is designed to clean dirt but not remove oil, so it keeps hair from drying out, meaning less frizz and more curl. At first, my hair got greasy using it, but it soon djusted and stopped making excess oil because I stopped stripping it of its natural oil. The conditioner is great too.
"
"
I was so happy that my item arrived and I was excited to use it. When I opened the box bottle of conditioner leaked due to bad packaging. Disappointing!!!!
"
"
I've been using deva curl since the summer, I recently order another DUO pack and noticed that the new bottles are significantly smaller than the bottles I originally ordered.
"
"
I love these two products - both the 'non-sudsing' no sulfate good for your hair shampoo and the wonderful conditioner.  My daughter's and I have curly hair, and mine is also dry.  These products leave our hair bouncy, shiny and revitalized.  Thoughtful botanical extracts and no animal testing make it a conscientious product as well.  Love the smell and the DevaCurl concept of not stripping the hair of natural oils needed for healthy locks.....
"
"
NEVER GOING BACK TO ANYTHING ELSE! This is THE ultimate product for curly girls/guys. It's so gentle I even use it on my baby. For years I wore my hair curly but this product is the first to actually heal my broken hair and restore it to what it always should have been. Adds the perfect amount of moisture without making my hair greasy. Cleans your scalp without drying it out. I recommend this product to EVERYONE, even people with straight hair. It's wonderful!!!!
"
"
Devacurl never fails me in shipment or the quality of their product!
"
"
This stuff works!  It was strange using a non foaming shampoo at first, however, after the first use I knew I was hooked!  My curly hair was more defined and under control.
"
"
I love this product!!! I have fine curly hair which does great with humidity but looks limp when the weather gets drier.  With DevaCurl my curls are always at their best, bouncy and not weighed down at all.  There are three other curly heads in the house all with different hair strand thickness and degrees of curliness...product works great an all types.  No oily build up and hair looks amazing.  Smells amazing too!!  For fine hair this product goes a long way, so glad I tried it.
"
"
The scent is very natural but since it's the strongest essential oil smell. I can see how some people thought it smelt like a chemical. But it smells so nice to me.
"
"
Makes my hair feel broken and brittle
"
"
Damaged hair. Has a horrible smell.
"
"
I've been using deva curl for over a year now and i absolutely love their products! the no-poo and one condition smell awesome, made my curls nicer, and made my hair soft. Even when i bleached my hair it only took 2-3 weeks to get healthy again. Also on the up side for me is their products are vegan friendly ^^I would recommend this to anyone with curly hair, and i'm sure people with straight hair could even use it!
"
"
The products seemed authentic, however the pump on the conditioner bottle was nonfunctional so I had to substitute the one from a bottle of ultra defining gel which got messy. Basically, don't throw away functioning pumps when buying these from amazon.
"
"
Totally different scent--this is NOT the actual product.  Imposter!  Do not buy this, pay close attention to the label verses the actual product sold in salons.
"
"
My only complaint is that it should have some type of padding around the bottles. When you open the package the product is all over the bottles.
"
"
What I received was a counterfeit product. I compared with the deva curl I purchased at a licensed retailer and this smells and looks different.
"
"
I can finally embrace my curly hair! My curls are defined and shiny without being frizzy, crunchy, or weighed down. I'm so happy! I also recommend the styling cream.
"
"
I really like DevaCurl no poo and one condition. I have been using Wen for the last 6-10 months and I loved it. But I have noticed that I have a lot of hair coming out in the shower and I feel that my hair is thinning. So I decided to try something else out for a while to see if my concerns are real. Deva Curl is the next best thing. The no poo is gentle on my hair and leaves my hair feeling clean and the one condition leaves it soft and make it easy to finger-comb my hair and get the tangles out before i get out the shower. I love it. And it is much cheaper than the Wen even with having to buy two bottles instead of one. DevaCurl may make me a convert from Wen. The only gripe I have is that it could smell better. I am not in love with the smell but it doesn't stink it just doesn't smell good to me. I definitely recommend trying it out. If you want to try it without the risk you can buy it from Sephora. They take returns of used items up to 60 days after. I always buy new items from them that way if I don't like it I can return it for a refund. Then if I like it I usually end up ordering it from Amazon after that.
"
"
it appears that women with curl have more bad hair days, however, I discovered the DivaCurl website and decided to take a chance on trying something different again. I know that I personally have tried every solution to try and make my hair straight. Today, I now embrace my natural curl and have found all Deva hair products to work very well if you go with your natural curl - never to use harsh products or curl/flat irons again.I would highly recommend this product to others that want to show off their natural curls. However, read her book or visit a registered salon before you expect miracles...
"
"
DevaCurl works great on my curly hair. It keeps it soft and moisturized and smells wonderful.
"
"
Great product! The only one that works on my daughter’s curly hair. Well worth the money!
"
"
Salon size is worth it. I love this product. The conditioner lasted  me about 9 months and the nopoo about 1.5 years
"
"
Bottle came with sharpie marks, spilled, wrapped in weird plastic that I've never seen this product come in. Didn't smell right.
"
"
These products have made all the difference for my bi-racial daughter and her super curly hair.  It controls frizz and makes her curls defined and bouncy. Her hair is softer and healthier since switching to this brand.
"
"
If you have curly hair you cannot live without DevaCurl. These products keep your curls bouncy and Frizz-Free. Most other items on the market leave curls feeling dry, heavy and full of product while DevaCurl moisturizes and hides split ends and frizz. Being a Curly Girl I couldn't live with out.I hope this helps you make an important decision!
"
"
Love the product, but the shampoo bottle not sealed well and I lost an ounce or two in the mail.
"
"
Amazing for people with curly hair. Turned my hair from being really dull into hair that has life
"
"
Love this product line.  Am always surprised at how clean my hair feels and the great texture my curls have when using this. Unfortunately it does have a drying affect not in my hair but on my scalp so I don't use in winter. Also wish they would offer a creamier conditioner and a different scent. Not fond of the lemon lime.
"
"
Item description says 32 oz shampoo and 32 oz conditioner. I received a 12 oz shampoo and 12 oz conditioner. Reading through some of the other reviews I see that i am not the only one who has had this issue
"
"
DevaCurl changed my life. Then I found DevaCare, and took it to another level. If you used DevaCurl before, the DevaCare is a richer product with a citrus scent. I never liked the herbal Devacurl scent, so this is an improvement in my book. It smells just like regular shampoo without making my hair feel like a rat's nest. The No Poo provides excellent slip for detangling. I highly recommend a Wet Brush, which you can buy here on Amazon, for detangling. It makes a world of difference, cutting your shower time in half (if you have as much hair as me!). For reference, I am a 2b/2c curly with baby fine strands and very low porosity (I have not dyed my hair in over five years). I recommend the DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel with Queen Helene Royal Curl Cream and Eden All Natural Curl Defining Creme, as well as a little melted coconut oil to seal your ends.
"
"
I've been using this product on my bi-racial daughters very curly hair for 2 years.  It never dries her hair out and keeps it healthy and shiny.  I have wavy hair and also us this along with they Angel to keep the curls defined all day. I would recommend DevaCurl products to anyone looking for hair care for curly heads.
"
"
I have ordered this same product multiple times from this vendor yet each time the product is slightly different. This time the conditioner is so thick it barely comes out of the pump. It almost like a paste.
"
"
quality and good price
"
"
The product is amazing I know the product! But the packaging is sub par.  There was conditioner and shampoo everywhere when i opened it. And a set of this is 60 freaking dollars. Ridiculous
"
"
The DevaCurl system is great! I had pretty much given up on my naturally curly hair ever looking good again. It was dry and limp, but DevaCurl works wonders. The DevaCurl process took some getting used to at first (as did the price!), but I honestly believe it's worth it. I've never been willing to spend much on beauty products of any kind, but this system really does work for me, and I will be sticking with it!
"
"
Love this shampoo and conditioner, plus it is so much cheaper here than the actual store
"
"
I love DevaCurl products.  However, the packaging needs to be better managed.  Both my shampoo and conditioner spilled in the plastic.  Not only did I lose product, but I had to spend time cleaning up the mess.
"
"
I made the mistake of ordering deva care. I have only purchased deva curl in the past. When I received it in the mail I thought it was a rip off and was not the product I ordered or remembered buying before...my mistake. I like deva curl alot better. I like the lemongrass smell and the condition has more slippage.  Deva curl does what you need it too but I don't like the smell...it reminds me of orange cream with peppermint maybe. So beware before you buy know that there is a difference between deva curl and deva care.
"
"
I've used Lo-Poo w/ B'Leave-in conditioner and they left my hair with much body. These 2 products leave my hair so soft that the curl disappears. What the deal???
"
"
This is great for curly hair!
"
"
Love this product but weirdly the package reeked of cigarettes when I opened it. Like really really stunk. Not sure if it’s a packaging or delivery problem
"
"
Just received my package, unfortunately one of rhe bottles spillec out into the vacuumed wrap.  Not much but it is very disappointing.  Obviously a defect in bottle.  I probably will not purchase again.
"
"
Great for curly and fine hair because it doesn't weight it down and keeps it from getting dry. Gentle and effective.
"
"
I have very thick, course curly hair .. and I am trying to learn to enjoy it .. and not straighten it all the time .. Some one told me about these Deva Curl Products and I am amazed at how well they work .. My hair is soft, full of moisture and the curls are so much prettier and more manageable .. I am very happy to have found both of these.. though I hear some people just use the conditioner very successfully .. Note: You do have to get used to shampooing your hair without any suds .. but now I love moving the cream through my hair .. and it cured my dry scalp as well . Yeah. Great product ..
"
"
this stuff works really well, love the smell of the One conditioner, we actually pit it in a spray bottle mixed with water as a spray leave in, works great when you just want to revive your curls with out washing your hair..
"
"
I’ve been using this shampoo for years! Smells great and works even better
"
"
Nice orange smell. Makes curly hair nice and hydrated. Shampoo will only make a little bit of suds if you add a little water to your hands. Rinse it well and it will be good. Only complaint is that it's so thick it's hard for me to grip that giant bottle and squeeze easily.
"
"
My daughter has very thick curly hair and loves these products. They work very well for her, and help reduce frizziness.
"
"
My naturally curly hair has never looked better. I will never go back to a traditional shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
I love the Decatur Duo. The Nopoo cleans my hair well without drying it out and the conditioner adds moisture without weighing my hair down.  I have curly hair but it is not corse so it can be hard to find a good balance between mosturizing without weighing it down.  They both also smell amazing to me.
"
"
This shampoo and conditioner set is simply a game changer. When used together, it's a home-run folks. My hair stylist introduced me to this brand and I have been amazed ever since. This set truly does it all. I am so grateful. I no longer get dry scalp, dry knotted areas, or puffy frizz zones. My hair detangles with just my fingers in the shower (crazy) and it curls voluminously when air dried. I simply love this product..... PS I use this in conjunction with Devacurl's ultra defining gel.
"
"
Love Devacurl products but this shipment seems like the product is not Devacurl.  Not the same consistency or smell or hair results. Disappointed.  Will not purchase from this vendor again.
"
"
They shipped the item fast and it was perfect. Deva Curl is awesome for curly hair.
"
"
Love the product so I bought the shampoo and the conditioner.  The price is the same as the store so I thought it would save me trip, but one of the pumps is defective and doesn't work. Conclusion: buy from the store next time so at least I can exchange if necessary. Not happy
"
"
This causes my scalp to itch and break out. It also caused my color to fade very fast. This product is not for me. Did very little for my 2A waves.
"
"
These products are greatness for my little girl's curly hair!
"
"
They must have not listed all of their ingredients or something because after 3 uses I broke out in Hives all over the top of my head. Now I'm out 80$ and can't even use what I bought.
"
"
I like the way it makes my hair look but it makes my scalp itch! Not sure what that's about. Other than the itch I would have given it 5 stars but I can't use the product.
"
"
The best combination for my lightweight, wavy hair.  These two big bottles last a long, long time.  Not much product is needed for an effective clean.  Love the mild scent.
"
"
The two bottles  (shampoo and conditioner) were packed in a bag but not padded. .The bag was full of spilled products, I  infer from the bottles banging against the inside of the box.
"
"
I just heard there is a lawsuit for this product because it’s thinning the hair. I am already too late for returning but will contact company directly. Please don’t buy
"
"
Smells great. Leaves hair looking and feeling great!
"
"
My daughter says that it's good on her nappy hair.
"
"
Some of the best products for curly hair. GREAT smell. Leaves curls looking healthy
"
"
Got this not realizing it had gluten.  I loved all the reviews on how natural it is.  Wheat is natural, just bad for my celiacs.  I only rated it a little lower because of reaction to the wheat.
"
"
The shampoo had busted during travel and the product was all over everything in the box. It was a mess.However, I could tell a difference in my hair after just the first use! My curls were beautiful!!!!
"
"
I love the smell and using it on my hair almost every day has truly made a huge difference in my hair texture, my curls, and my overall hair and I will never use anything else again!!!
"
"
This is the best shampoo for my thin wavy hair. Brings out even more curls with a strength instead of weighing it down. What a find. I barely use any other shampoo now.
"
"
Very good.
"
"
I'm so glad I found this product line!  The no poo shampoo and conditioner leave my hair so beautifully curly. I definitely recommend this if you have curly hair
"
"
Love some DevaCurl. Great deal for the duo, fantastic products for soft, bouncy, sleek curls! Highly recommend!
"
"
These are all I'll every buy! Enough Said.
"
"
These bottles didn't come with the pumps included.  They are very heavy and hard to handle without the pumps - I will not buy from them again- false advertising.
"
"
I think this stuff smells horrible, my husband hates it too. And it does not make my curls bouncy and lovely, it makes them limp. I don't know what the draw of this stuff is supposed to be, but it didn't work for me.
"
"
I have ordered this pack multiple times from other sources. This one came and both bottles were leaking from the top. Other merchants tape the cap so it doesn't twist off and leak. Product itself is amazing.
"
"
works well! but it is expensive.  why does it have to be this expensive.
"
"
These are the best products I have ever used on my curly, thick, color treated hair.  Love devacare!
"
"
DevaCurl products are the best!  I have NEVER been able to find any other product like it and I have tried everything!  My hair is no longer frizzy and I have nice big bouncy curls.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
I bought them with a few other things, and I've see. The reviews of them being delivered broken, but mine came fine and just like the photo.
"
"
this product was tampered with and was not the actual DevaCurl Conditioner. It smelled very much like Pantene.
"
"
It's just right for my hair. Second time purchase and I went for the big size cos it's just worth it. Plus it smells heavenly.
"
"
Love my Deva products
"
"
Use if for my daughters hair.  Fantastic.  Just wish it didn't cost so much.... but it's worth every penny.  They sell this now at Target but only the small size which isn't worth it because it only comes in a small size.
"
"
Ordered product in the morning and received it by the afternoon. Love this shampoo and conditioner. Leave my hair feeling clean and moisturized.
"
"
I have curly hair and this product just made my hair dry and hard to brush i wouldn't recommended it! What a disappointment! :-(
"
"
Great product & fast shipping
"
"
These products are the best for curly hair, it helps my hair to grown faster, i really love these!
"
"
I have been using this product for about a month. The fact that it doesn't lather doesn't bother me because my hair feels just as clean after washing it out. It doesn't seem to dry out my hair either. As for the smell of the shampoo.. not great but not terrible either. Kind of reminded me of the smell that hits you when you walk into a salon (slightly). The conditioner does have a nice scent. I have wavy hair and it does seem to help maintain the waves longer. With other shampoos my hair would lose it's wave by the end of the day. I do still put a smoothing balm in my hair because it doesn't take the frizz completely away. A reviewer said to use silicon free products. So, in conclusion- my hair feels healthier (and I've colored it twice this year), my waves are more defined and stay longer but I had to get used to the shampoo smell and there's some frizz (only reasons it doesn't get 5 stars) I don't see myself switching shampoos any time soon!** update: I'm switching to 5 stars because I am (strangely) no longer bothered by the smell of shampoo. It doesn't bother me and I actually like it now. I've been using since November and I still love it. I now also use it in combination with deva curl light defining gel and love the combined effect.
"
"
I got a replacement for shampoo and conditioner I didn’t know I needed to return the original which was leaked out I’m getting a message saying I need to return it
"
"
This is not the real devacurl product. Smells horrible.
"
"
My shampoo leaked in shipping but other than that I love this shampoo and conditioner
"
"
I love these products. Keep curly hair moisturized and full bodied.
"
"
I like these products. They wash and condition my curly, frizzy, unruly hair and are a good deal for the amount you get.
"
"
Conditioner bottle pump was broken.The product should get 5 stars because I absolutely love it. But the shipping was awful. It was in a plastic bag with tape, no protection whatsoever.
"
"
Good product
"
"
The bottles were not full, but other than that it was as described. For the price, I would probably buy it again.
"
"
This is the best shampoo and conditioner for wavy/curly hair, so gentle and effective.
"
"
Love this product.  Packaging is simple with easy to read labels, and products performs as per description.  Scent is pleasant, and both cleanser and conditioner are gentle and non-abrasive.  Highly recommend.
"
"
I've tried so many different products for my curls and none of them have been as good as Deva products. Deva products give my curls softness and bounce. The conditioner makes my curls so much easier to style. The shampoo however doesn't quiet clean my hair,after a day my hair feels itchy. I use it in combination with other shampoos. I still use it because the shampoo also makes my hair softer and helps out my curls.
"
"
Not really happy with it. Not sure what it does if anything.
"
"
I bought this shampoo and conditioners set hoping to  moisturize my curls. I am very disappointed. My hair is dryer than ever with these products

I love what this shampoo does for my curls and scalp.  I have struggled with an itchy scalp for years and the dermatologist couldn't give me an explanation as to why or a solution.  I noticed 2 things immediately after starting this shampoo. First, my scalp no longer itches and second, less hair falls out when I wash it.  Not sure why, but my guess for both would be the harshness of the surfactants in other shampoos.  Also, now I have great curls even on top!  Used to be when I grew my hair out the curls on top would get straightened out by the weight of my hair.  Now they don't do that.  I also use their LIght Defining Gel daily and the cream when it's incredibly humid.  They give my Celtic curls a natural shine and volume.  I have never loved my hair more!For those who've never used a latherless shampoo, it does take some getting used to.  The first time I quit because I couldn't believe it could possibly be getting my hair and scalp clean.  I never thought about the fact that if my hair wasn't clean then my curls wouldn't be so defined all the way to the top!  I'm so glad I gave it a 2nd try and even more glad that I went to their website and chatted with one of their advisors to figure out which products were best for my hair.

i am in love with my curly hair. where was this product when I was in high school? Could have save me many a frizzy nickname! love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love
"

This is a great product for women or men with course hair.  It has really changed the texture of my daughters hair and is now more tamable, less frizzy and more hydrated than normal.
"

Arrived exploded. Lost a lot of product.

My low rating has nothing to do with DevaCurl, I absolutely love their products.  However, based on the image and title for this product, I expected to receive the ORIGINAL DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition.  Instead, I received the discontinued line of DevaCare products.  Looking back on the item page, the only place I see ""DevaCare"" listed is in the ""About the Product"" section, despite the DevaCurl Original being shown in both the title and photo of the product. So, if anyone is planning on purchasing this product, please keep in mind that it will be DevaCurl's DEVACARE line, not the original products.On the other hand, anyone thinking of using any of DevaCurl's products, I strongly recommend them! They make my curly hair look and smell great!
"
"
I love this for my hair.
"
"
My hair is a mixture of all curls. I've struggled to find a good moisturizing shampoo/conditioner. This has worked really well. Only problem I have is that I never know how clean my hair is when I use the no poo, since I'm used to the foam of regular shampoos. My hair is really shiny now and soft. This product has helped a ton with elasticity too!
"
"
I have been a DevaCurl girl for years and have tried other products targeted for curly hair suggested by friends...but I always go back to DevaCurl (those friends are DevaCurl girls now too). Love the revamped difuser as well. As a user you have to find the correct protocol that works for you. I find that reapplying a bit of ""water downed"" conditioner works well as a leave-in conditioner in combination with the cream or light gel.
"
"
This Shampoo and Conditioner is amazing!! It really brings out the curls! The no-poo shampoo takes some getting used to, because it doesn't lather and foam up, but boy does it work! I highly recommend this product!
"
"
I love this stuff! I asked my hairstylist sister-in-law what products to use on curly hair after being severely disappointed by another brand. She sent me the trial pack and I was so happy, I bought the full-size versions of the No-Poo Cleanser and the One Conditioner right away. The other products in the trial package are great too, but they last much longer. I am mixed-race and have curly hair (type 3B). This stuff works WONDERFULLY on my hair. I do not use any extra shampoo outside of the No-Poo cleaner. It doesn't lather, but it smells really good, it conditions, and I can see that it's cleansing after I rinse. The cleanser and the conditioner both offer good slip for combing your hair out. I suggest using your fingers or a wide-tooth comb while conditioner is on your hair if you have curly hair. Do not comb when it's dry! I apply the conditioner, and sometimes I rinse a little bit and sometimes I just leave it all in. My hair never feels heavy. It feels very light -- like there's nothing in there at all -- and my curls form awesomely! I've constantly had people at work asking me what did I do to my hair or what products I put in my hair because there is a big change in how healthy and nice it looks. I recommend letting your hair air dry and not messing with it. DevaCurl also has a non-sticky curl defining gel and a humidity spray that I use as well. If you have curly hair -- try this! I've tried other products and have been suuuuper disappointed. DevaCurl has been such a breath of fresh air.By the way, they have a very strong, fruity smell. Some people may not be into that. I like it!
"
"
While this duo did well on hair performance-wise.  The smell reminded me of rest areas.  Sorry, it did.  I moved onto Canty co-wash.
"
"
So much love for this product. It has change my life. My hair and its accompanying frizz was a huge part of my life. Every day is a good hair day now! My curls look amazing, but more than that, they're healthy!
"
"
These keep my hair soft without a build-up.  I won't use anything else on my hair!  My hair no longer has a ton of breakage like it used to have.
"
"
An awesome duo that I have been using for many years. They are gentle on hair, smell delightful, makes your hair nice, shiny, full of body, and clean without horrible chemicals.
"
"
The shampoo is great, low lather, and smells faintly of rosemary.  The conditioner seems very runny and not particularly moisturizing for my curls.  It also has a weird citrus bathroom cleaner smell.
"
"
Love this product ! Will be ordering more from you ! Thank you !
"
"
The pump came broken of both the Shampoo and the Conditioner. The shampoo's is a little broken but the conditioner's is totally broken.
"
"
This product has changed since my last purchase. My hair/scalp is dry.  I don't care for the Deva Curl brand any longer.
"
"
This product is a must in a daily regimen for curly hair.  It helps maintaining curls and is good for your hair.  I'm glad it comes in a large quantity.  DevaCurl products are of good quality.
"
"
My hair loved this no-poo but my skin did not. I broke out in a bad rash on my neck from it and had to give it away. Now I'm back to frizzy hair while I wait for my neck to heal.
"
"
Love my Deva Curl products!  Been using them for years & have nothing else like them!!
"
"
It was not the same product.  Product was a fake. Did not smell the same.  Different texture. Different packaging.  Different everything. A complete imitation. and a bad one at that.
"
"
Great deal on these products.
"
"
The product you will receive is DevaCare and not what is in the picture or title of the posting (DevaCurl). I ordered the duo, but the quality of the product is awful compared to the DevaCurl products. The product is a thick disgusting consistency, has no scent, does not cleanse or condition as well, and did not come with a pump, and because of consistency does not pump even if you use your own pump. You will be disappointed if you're expecting the great DevaCurl quality.
"
"
Love how it makes our hair look.... it really brings out the curls in my naturally wavy hair. It works even better on my boyfriend's hair! Lovely smell too-- people are always huffing my hair and complimenting me for the smell. Haha!The only downside is after a few months of using it we are both experiencing dandruff and dry/itchy scalp... when we stopped using this No-Poo it cleared up. I wish they would change the formula to something more gentle and moisturizing.Since then, we do still use this but to stop the dandruff need to do a scalp mask with coconut oil to keep our scalps from drying out.
"
"
These products have transformed my hair! I can't do without them!!
"
"
Best curly hair product ever. I now have ringlets--and no frizz!
"
"
I have been using DevaCurl products for quite some time now and they are great.  I have a mix of 3b and 3c hair type and they give me the necessary amount of moisture without weighting my hair down.  I'm against a long routine so this are great. I wash, condition and use the light gel; and my hair stay frizz free for at least 3 days.
"
"
I love it!  DevaCurl products are the BEST things I have ever used on my hair.  Finally, I can let my hair air dry without hating the results!  My curls last longer than ever, are bouncier than ever, feel soft, and smell great.  Unless my hair texture changes drastically, I'm never using another brand of shampoo or conditioner.
"
"
I'm already obsessed with this product. I'll never purchase anything else for my curly hair again.
"
"
This product was such a disappointment. I am a huge fan of DevaCurl No-Poo, but this is not it. It's a light colored, yellow-ish formula that smells really different than the white, thick formula of the real No-Poo. These products dried my hair out and left it looking ashy, stringy, and frizzy. It made the ends of my hair look fried. I have never tried a DevaCurl conditioner before, but if it made my hair look this bad, I feel like it must be a faulty imitation product as other reviews have suggested. Don't waste your money on these!!!! Go buy the real thing from the website or directly from DevaCurl on Amazon.
"
"
I have curly hair and have used this for years. Love it!
"
"
I like that it seems to work with my thin curly hair. I can allow it to air dry and it'll look good, not dry and frizzy. I only wish the smell of it was different... It has a very strong chemical-y smell. Other than that not too bad.
"
"
Works great on my curls!
"
"
Left heavy  build up in my hair. Have used the product in the past and don't recall that it left my hair with such a build up. I throw the product out.
"
"
Grandaughter loves the way it enhances her curls!!!
"
"
Legit authentic product
"
"
Best products for curly hair!
"
"
Ordered many many times. Wife loves it. A go to.
"
"
Love the product. Amazon and its partners make it easy to have it shipped right to my home. Occasional yet minimal leaking may happen in the shipping process, but both pumps and bottles work perfectly! I will be ordering again.
"
"
Amazing products! I love Deva Curl and the way it smells. I've been using it for years now and it works amazing on my thin curly hair. The conditioner is thick which is very helpful, and the shampoo is too. Delivery was perfect! Ordered it this morning and got it this afternoon, Amazon's same-day shipping is a god send. And the price for this product is unbeatable! Highly recommend
"
"
I love this shampoo and conditioner..Smells good leaves my hair soft and clean. Very moisturizing for my dry curly hair. I went to the salon (DEVSHAN)best hair cut I ever had..I will also always use these products. I highly recommend.
"
"
We have been using this for my 9 year old bi-racial grand-daughters hair which works great.  This makes it easy to wash without a lot of soap/lather. The cream rinse also makes it nice & smoothi wish I can find something for the dryness.
"
"
This product is great for my curls but I cannot use it daily because my hair gets too greasy.
"
"
Love this duo!
"
"
Love these Deva Curl products for my hair.
"
"
Product wasn't as helpful at taming my dry, frizzy curls as I had hoped.  That said, though, it does appear to work better than other products I've tried.  I have to leave a lot of conditioner in (ie not rinse as well) to get noticeable results.
"
"
Diva Curl products keep the moisture in my daughter's curls so that her hair stays curly and not frizzy. This is the only brand she will use and Amazon consistently has the best price on it when shipped with Prime.
"
"
Smells great clean and minty texture is medium/watery i tend to use more conditoner im mixed Mexican  and black high porosity  hair
"
"
The lids came unscrewed from the bottles and leaked into the plastic bag they were shipped it. Product lost was about 1/5.
"
"
The product arrived in a plastic wrap, however the inside of the wrap was covered with the conditioner. The cap wasn't sealed which allowed the product to leak.
"
"
Love this stuff.!!!!  I had been using the same hair products for at least 25 years (kerasilk),  and despite using other products along the way nothing compared, a year ago my hair dresser suggested these products, and I have never looked back since.
"
"
the no-poo smells like roses. My hair does not frizz up like with most other products
"
"
I love this cleansing conditioner and moisturizing conditioner for my fine, curly hair! It doesn't build up, it smells refreshing without being over-perfumed and it leaves my hair glossy and my curls soft!
"
"
Every time I buy this product my hair loves it.  Won't last long since I have really long hair but I can always tell the difference from one product to another.  I will be buying from this seller again.  This product was legit.
"
"
Makes my tangly hair easier to comb through in the shower and looks smooth when dry.
"
"
This shampoo does everything it claims it does. Before using the product my curls were frizzy waves and I hated the way they looked without heat styling. After using this shampoo and conditioner combo my waves are closer to curls and look great even when I just let my hair air dry.
"
"
Smells like cleaning chemical. This can’t be authentic. I’ve used these products too long. The feel and smell is NOT Devacurl.
"
"
Love this product - my natural curls come out with it!
"
"
i finally found the right shampoo for my bi racial daughters hair!!!  alas!
"
"
I LOVE the DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner, but was highly disappointed when both the bottles arrived having spilled in the packaging. It was a huge mess, and I lost a good deal of the product itself. Previously, I have bought the 12oz bottles from my hair salon. Ordering the bigger bottles online is more cost-effective, but I don't know if it's worth the clean-up or spilled hair products.
"
"
went back to the original, tried the lighter version, not moisturizing enough for me.  had better results with curls & bounce.
"
"
The best product line I've found for my naturally curly hair. I recommend using the Curl Cream after washing and conditioning.
"
"
Great product for my hair. I have really curly corse hair and it drys out easily with other products.  This product keeps it hydrated and soft.
"
"
this is all I need to create beautiful curls.  no styling products needed.  my duo forever  susan
"
"
My go to. Nothing Compares. And I don't get a better value anywhere else.
"
"
The product is fine but the pump on the shampoo doesn't work...at all. That's the second time that's happened with this product. It's ALOT of shampoo and a bit pricey to have a pump that doesn't work.
"
"
only purchase this product from an authorized deva curl supplier (which these sellers are NOT). had a completely different experience with this product.
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
As I've aged, my hair has gotten very wavy and a bit frizzy.  I tried this product in a sample form and loved it so much that I now use it regularly.  Be warned, the shampoo is not a sudsy foaming shampoo since it has no sulfates.  It takes a bit of getting used to but it's well worth it.  My hair always feels clean, soft and shiny after using.  The conditioner is equally as great.  I use it as both a conditioner and leave-in.  Might be overkill but I condition my hair, as one normally would following the shampooing.  After rinsing and squeezing out excess water, I apply a very small amount to just the ends of my hair and then towel dry as usual.  I allow my hair to air dry naturally and it's soft and shiny with lots of body.  However, if I really want to ""pop"" my curls, I usually add a small amount of the Devacurl Light Defining Gel.
"
"
It tames my curly hair and helps keep it healthy.
"
"
Awesome product.  Have been using consistently for 4+ years.
"
"
Listing is misleading. The item is listed as DevaCurl but is actually DevaCare. Do not buy this product if you usually buy the DevaCurl original duo.
"
"
I love the DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition for my hair! I struggled for years jumping from one shampoo brand to another until I was introduced to these products and now I'm absolutely addicted to them because they leave my curls looking well hydrated and shaped! Shampoo completely drys my curls and makes them look dead!
"
"
I leave it on for a few minutes after using deva curl mo-poo cleanser, and my hair feel so much softer.
"
"
Really good. It worked better for me if I use de conditioning only at the ends avoiding the scalp. I have curly hair and I'm trying to recover from excessive use of heat.
"
"
I love this brand. Helps keep the curl in my hair and the frizz down
"
"
Love this. Would not go a day without it. I used to hate my curly haired now I wear it down and curly every day!
"
"
Enjoy using these
"
"
The absolute best no poo shampoo for naturally curly hair that is color treated!! Pair with the Ultra Defining Gel for all day curl with no frizz
"
"
Have used this for years
"
"
My curly hair has never looked better, it is fuller and the curls are more defined.
"
"
reliable, good shipping. this is a great product for curly hair, I've been using it for years and happy to be able to purchase using prime.
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Love these!  Great duo!I leave the conditioner in, it defines my curls.
"
"
Smells amazing, leaves my curls clean and hydrated
"
"
Has a eucalyptus  sent.  I like it, but the scent is strong.  It  works though.  Hair has never been healthier.
"
"
My hair felt good and then it just felt greasy. I liked the idea, but its just not for my curly hair
"
"
I have 4a,b, and C hair. I really like what both of these do for my hair. The No-Poo gets my scalp clean and refreshed. And it leaves my hair clean without being dry. The conditioner is awesome. My hair loves it, my skin not so much. I've had to adjusted the way I use it so that it does not cause my skin to break out. But then again too much oil also causes me to break out. I also use their Styling cream. For all of their products, a lot really does go a long way. I cannot cut out my use of oil completely, my scalp still needs a little jojoba oil once a day, but for the most part, I don't need any other extra heavy creams or balms so much. I only break out the SM curling smoothie when I am doing a wet/set type of style. They are awesome, but you will have to try to find out.
"
"
This is the best S/C ever. Even if you don't have curls. Use it on my 4 year old granddaughter makes her hair like silk. No tears smells devine
"
"
I have 3b texture hair and it works miracles. I usually use the leave in afterwards
"
"
it made my hair really cores and dry. I have used this product be for and loved it so I am not sure what is wrong with these bottles
"
"
Love this product. Has greatly changed my unruley hair!
"
"
I love the deva curl but I'm not crazy about the shampoo. I feel like it doesn't do a great job on leaving you with a clean hair but I have seen the difference with my curls,
"
"
Love this stuff, best curly hair product ever!
"
"
Love how soft, and curly my hair is when using DevaCurl!! It had repaired the dryness and cleanses without damaging! Finally, I can have clean, beautiful curls without drying out my fine, thin hair!
"
"
The products came in a timely fashion, but one of the bottles came with a broken top. The top was supposed to be a pump top that you turn and the pump pops up, but when I turned the top, the top didn't pop up. It's inconvenient to use the bottle now as I have to open the top each time and product gets wasted.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair, I bought this for the first time in December and recent got new ones. I love it! My curls hold nicely are soft and bouncy and I get tons of compliments.
"
"
Bargain for both products! Love DevaCurl items, packed securely and shipped promptly!
"
"
Loved this from the salon, but finally figured out that the shampoo was making me loose my hair... LOTS of it.  Not sure if they changed the formula or the provider through Amazon was a fake.  Afraid to even try it from the salon again.
"
"
GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING
"

"
"
Love DevaCurl stuff...but please note that this is conditioning cleanser, not just cleanser shampoo.  It actually makes my curly hair (which is fine to begin with) a little too soft.  :)
"
"
I absolutely love this product!! Im nineteen and I wish I would have found Devacurl sooner so I wouldn't have damaged my hair with all the heat I used to tame it when I was younger. I have had curly hair all of my life and have never been able to tame it...until now. It's a little weird getting used to the shampoo not lathering but after a few washes you get used to it. I just started using the conditioner and it works wonders also. It's strange because the ""no-poo"" has a conditioner-like texture and thickness, whereas the ""one condition"" is thinner and feels like watery sunscreen. But for how awesome this stuff works, I don't care what it feels like. My hair is soft, frizz free (even in high humidity), and my curls are beautiful. I can even take a shower and go out and let it air dry without having to worry about my hair getting big and crazy. It is pricy but completely worth it. I also use Argan oil and the coconut curl styler after I shower, let it air dry, and it literally looks like I curled my hair!
"
"
Makes my head itch like no other. Also seems to lift my hair color. Love the rose mint scent though.
"
"
This works well on my 2b/2c waves. This is a great price for the product.
"
"
Does wonders for my daughter’s  curly hair.  A truly amazing product!
"
"
I had to give this two stars because the conditioner pump doesn't work.  I have to pull it out and slide my hand down it to get the product onto my hand.  Otherwise I love the products themselves!
"
"
My go to brand.  Cannot go wrong when you have naturally curly hair.
"
"
Perfect item.  Great price
"
"
reduces frizz like no other
"
"
I have struggled with my curls my whole life. After a friend suggested DevaCurl, I ordered this combo and I will never go back. My hair is softer, more manageable and much less frizzy. I will say my fiance doesn't love the scent, but it doesn't smell bad. Its just not like the typical shampoos/conditions. Either way, I love this product!
"
"
Great for curly hair. Can pass a comb through without tangles or snarls. Hair is very shiny, The no lather shampoo takes a little getting used to but will definitely be purchasing again.
"
"
It was broken and linking in the package
"
"
My curly hair has been awakened with these products. I will be purchasing the gel, as soon as I run out of my cheap CVS stuff. The smell reminds me of after going to the salon, which I love also. Will not buy anything else for my curly hair from now on.
"
"
Love the product! Prompt shipping!
"
"
Awful smell.  This is not the authentic product. Should receive negative stars.
"
"
Didn't seem the same as what I purchased at the salon and Ulta.  Even smelled differently.....
"
"
The product is fine. My issue here is that there is no shampoo above the label. I paid for a quarter empty bottle. I guess it wasn’t a good deal after all.
"
"
I love this combination!  My hair isn't as dry now!
"
"
works as expected
"
"
These products do wonders for my curls!
"
"
These products are a bit expensive, but a little goes a long way and most importantly they work!
"
"
Love the product but when I opened the box it came in, it had leaked everywhere. It’s expenisve stuff so it’s annoying that I had to lose so much before it even arrived to me
"
"
My curls LOVE this product.  Take the time to use as directed.  It has really helped my frizzy hair!!
"
"
First of all, I LOVE DEVACURL. I have very dry, thick curly hair, and I find that Devacurl products are the only thing that can consistently make it soft and shiny and manageable. I am a college student, so expensive haircare products aren't usually prioritized in my budget, but I always make sure to save for my NoPoo and conditioner.On the products themselves: I find that NoPoo does a great job of cleansing my scalp, and doing so while keeping my hair soft. I rarely use traditional shampoo (once a month maybe? Or whenever I'm feeling particularly greasy) because this product works so well. One pump works for my whole head, and that's AWESOME! I could talk for HOURS about how much I love One Condition. One pump to a pump and half is enough for my nearly waist-length curly hair. This summer, I couldn't afford DevaCurl, and I needed 6-7 pumps of drugstore conditioner to get anywhere near the same conditioning effects. It's wonderful for my hair rinsed out, but when I need a little something extra I'll leave it in! So hydrating!! Sometimes I'll treat it like a hair mask, and saturate my hair in it for a few hours. There's nothing this stuff can't do!!!Now, for the reason behind my one star review. Today when I received my order, both bottles leaked a tremendous amount inside the bag they were sealed inside. Thank goodness the bottles were placed inside a bag! They were placed inside a box with two surge protector power strips that I ordered, and it would have been highly unpleasant to have had those ruined by hair products. I'm also disappointed because it seems like a significant amount of product was lost. Both bottles are slightly concave as if they were squeezed tightly and then closed, as well as noticeably less than full. I'm disappointed because it feels like I'm not really getting my money's worth, and I really love this stuff. I guess I'll just have to hope that I can find it in-store somewhere for next time.
"
"
Hair feels clean, shiny and healthy. Frizz free. Hair looks great.
"
"
Great products  leaves curly/wavy hair clean smelling and manageable. Quick delivery from this vendor.  Thank you😃
"
"
Love the smell, already feel like my curls are staying intact
"
"
I love, love, love this product. I didn't think I'd like a no-poo shampoo but I do & the conditioner is incredible. The smell is nice too. I don't like anything too strong or perfumey & this has a clean, fresh scent. My hair stylist always told me how dry my hair was & that was using RedKen. This has made my hair so soft & manageable. I have Caucasian, naturally curly, wavy, crazy, frizzy hair. It isn't really think but not thin either. Some parts are curlier & some straighter so my hair is a hot mess. Also I do color my hair ever 6 weeks. This really makes my hair feel healthy. Received this really quickly. I think it's a great price & I would def recommend the product & the seller. I bought just the conditioner from a different seller at a cheaper price & it was watered down. This is the real deal. You get what you pay for.
"
"
Overall I absolutely love these products. I never knew I could take this frizzy mop on my head until a friend turned me on to these two years ago. Since then I’ve always ordered this particular set of shampoo and conditioner without one problem. However, my last purchase in November left quite a lot to be desired. First, theproduct was all over inside the box. I excused that. Things happen in shipping. However, the smell of the conditioner was awful. Terrible. Unusable. It was in the more recent product packaging as the bottles changed in the last year or so. But really this conditioner was bad. I’ve ordered plenty of times without issue so I’m going to order again right now. It’s a risk but I hate to give up a tried ad true seller without a little forgiveness.I’ll update in the next few days to let you know what I receive.Again, these products are amazing and I actually feel good about my hair when I use them. It’s the one purchase that brings the review down.
"
"
love having a huge supply of this stuff. treats my hair well.
"
"
I have used Deva products for years. The conditioner is okay. The no-poo is blah. Granted, I bought this a while ago but shis no-poo doesn't seem to work as well and I change up my shampoos religiously. Won't buy it again.
"
"
Hair changed from only mildly wavy to seriously wavy/mildly curly in late 40's.  This product has been a life changer!  My hair looks better than ever when I wear it curly.  Amazon's price is very good!
"
"
Love these products for my curly hair, very moisturizing. I struggle with dry hair and this stuff just does it for me and gets better and better every time I use it. As well the price and shipping was very reasonable for these two products.
"
"
Just as described. Will buy from again.
"
"
My girls have long LONG super-curly hair.  This is the only product that helps.
"
"
The product works well on my hair - helps with my frizzy curls.  The only down side is that it is more perfumy than I like.
"
"
Always wonderful! Thank you DevaCurl for helping me embrace the curl.
"
"
Love it !!! Have not found a better product for curly hair thank this
"
"
These hair care products have changed the way, I care for my hair.  My morning hair ritual is a fraction of the time it used to be.
"
"
Love this. Love the price.
"
"
I have been using this for years. I have been buying it thru Amazon for a few years now and I save about $20.00 getting it thru Amazon vs. a beauty retailer. Seems to be of the same quality as the retailer at a better price. I will keep buying it thru DevaCare. Great price and product.
"
"
I have ordered these products before from Amazon before without problems. But it was always one bottle at a time, not a duo. When I opened my package I noticed that the color of the shampoo and conditioner was different (not white like it should be)  and once I opened the bottle, I realized someone somewhere messed up because it is not the same smell. The bottles were ""taped shut"" with yellow paint tape, which should have been a big red flag.
"
"
This product won't help your face look any better but your hair definitely will. Will be purchasing again.
"
"
It took not buying any other shampoo so that my daughter would use this.. She didnt like the smell.. no matter how good it worked for her curls, the smell was a major turn off.

Original product all white not yellow color like others said they received. Excited to use my devacurl
"
"
Wonderful product. Arrived on time.
"
"
Had a different smell than the one I buy locally
"
"
Best shampoo and condition out there for curly hair.  This shampoo is great for the Louisiana water.
"
"
I ordered the 32 oz but received a 12 oz shampoo and conditioner
"
"
Same stuff you get in your salon for a much more competitive price.  What more could I ask for?  Thanks Amazon!
"
"
This Deva Curl has changed my life now it only takes me 15 minutes to do my hair no hassle no dreading wash hair day. I simply love it. Also my hair is all natural no relaxer anymore. Highly recommend the conditioner because you go through a lot
"
"
After one use I saw a difference in my curls, and after about three uses I saw significant difference in my curls. They form in exactly the way they look when I use my wand on the top half of my hair (because it never used to dry curly) and all of my hair dries curly now! It is a little more expensive than most shampoos (compared to Pantene that I was using before) but it is SO worth it to not have to style my hair at all. My curls used to only really form in humid places like the beach, but every day my hair dries exactly as I would have styled it. I dry my hair with a t-shirt to prevent frizz in addition to using Deva Curl and I have perfect curls every day! Definitely worth the investment.
"
"
Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner! Smalls wonderful and my hair looks and feels great! Never turning back to traditional shampoo.
"
"
I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls. I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren't any better than their cheaper counterparts. Don't waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products. Head to Target for the same type of shampoo, Frizz-Free stuff, gel & condition without bruising your credit card. My opinion only, but I've found better products for my curly hair at Ross', TJ Max and Marshalls. Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz. It's cheap & it works.
"
"
The shampoo smells different. Smells like it has sat on a shelf too long. Not right representation of Deva products!
"
"
Great conditioner!
"
"
Exactly as expected
"
"
Is a great product
"
"
Deva Curl! Cool!
"
"
Best haircare for curly hair.
"
"
My Daughter won't use any other hair care products & she has a ton of beautiful hair
"
"
Great alternative to conventional shampoo. I've focused very hard for the last couple years to cut out sulfate shampoos, and this leaves my hair feeling healthier than standard shampoos.
"
"
Love this product.  Makes all the difference for curly girls!
"
"
best ever
"
"
A curly hair must have.  While suitable for any curly hair, the Deva Care line, as Deva Curl, is recommended for color treated hair, though I've used both with excellent results.
"
"
There was quite a bit of product leakage . Seller tried to seal the pumper with tape buto shampoo and conditioner still spilled out.
"
"
When I received my product they exploded inside the box, a lot of it spilled out.  Is there anything you can do to help?
"
"
After a month my daughter’s hair started falling out.
"
"
This product serious frizzled out my hair and made it unmanageable.
"
"
my favorite duo  Love the product
"
"
Love this product! I have semi curly to wavy hair. Definitely takes some work and product to make it look good. I found that this shampoo/conditioner enhances my curls and leaves my hair nice and soft. Works great when I straighten my hair too. You get used to the ""no poo"" and my hair still feels just as clean.
"
"
This product works so well!  It conditions my daughters hair while keeping it clean!  This is my favorite hair cleanser and conditioner for my bi-racial daughter!  She is currently almost 5 years old.  We have tried a lot of products...this is great!!
"
"
Great Product !
"
"
Best product for naturally curly haired girls. It made me love my curls for the first time ever!
"
"
Doesn't dry out my hair like shampoo.
"
"
great curly hair product -- some of the best
"
"
I will never go back to any other curl product. I am obsessed with DevaCurl. My curls have never looked better!
"
"
I am now only buying this product here instead of Ulta!
"
"
if you have curly hair...no suds shampoo will not strip itor dry it out...sometimes I wash my hair using only the conditioner
"
"
My daughter loves this for her mixed ethnic girls!  Each of the girls have different types of hair. It works for all of them.
"
"
This is the best hair product brand out there! Worth every penny. I have curly hair and leaves it soft and curly at the same time.
"
"
I love this product but for some reason my package came open.
"
"
I'm so excited after getting this product, I just learned about this product 6 months ago and it wonderful for my thick curls and replaces my wash routine ❤️😍✔️
"
"
LOVE this product! Great for my curls. Received timely, but unfortunately open. Lost a good bit of both products in the spill.
"
"
Works wonders on my hair!!!
"
"
Actually, I bought this for my Niece.  She loves it!!!
"
"
Arrived well packaged, on time and exactly as described.  Thank You
"
"
The top of the shampoo was loose and caused the product to spill out!
"
"
Came quickly and DevaCurl works wonders! The best treatment for your curls in my opinion!!
"
"
I love this product because it doesn't contain detergent, which most shampoos do, and therefore, allows your hair to look and feel shinier and healthier!  After going to the Devachan Salon and learning how to use their products, I am getting awesome results.  I also use the Ultra Defining Gel which does a great job defining your curls without being sticky.Suggested regimen:  While in the shower, after cleansing and conditioning with DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition (don't squeeze out water after rinsing out conditioner), bend at the waist and apply a generous amount of Ultra Defining Gel to soaking wet hair by coating product gently over the bottom, top and each side of hair.  (You do not need to apply it throughout your hair but only as an outer shell.) Then grab the ends and begin squeezing upward, scrunching the hair and squeezing out the excess water.  You can then take a microfiber towel and continue to gently scrunch as you remove more moisture.Stand up straight and ""don't touch"" your curls again until they are dry.  You can put some clips on small sections on top to allow the hair to dry with some height.  Then, after hair is dry, you can slide your fingers under the top layers of hair and hand scrub your scalp to loosen up the curls and then scrunch again the outer curls to break up the cast from the gel.  You'll be amazed at the results!!
"
"
My answer to my hair prayer!!! a must try .. along with the Mist-er Right , and Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel formerly Deva Care Arc Angel
"
"
Very disappointed. Only received the conditioner but paid for the shampoo and conditioner bundle!!
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Very Quilty
"
"
Love love love.
"
"
This thing is amazing! No fuzzy hair anymore. Love it!
"
"
This works fantastic, much watch youtube tutorial on how to use
"
"
It's a must have for curly or wavy hair!!!!!! LOVE IT!
"
"
The formula for these products must have changed.
"
"
LOVE THIS NO-POO FOR MY CURLY HAIR.
"
"
Purchased for my daughter and I cant believe how amazing her hair looks and feels.
"
"
Not for me. Gave me dandruff.
"
"
Awesome product at a great price.
"
"
I love the product, it works for my hair. The only negative is that the pump for the no-poo cleanser did not work...
"
"
The best!! I had bleached my hair and my curls were not bouncy and I was gonna cut it to get the curls back. But thanks to my cousin recommending this product I got full bounce. Follow the 3 steps and you will be thrilled!
"
"
A great buy!
"
"
I don't really know how I justified paying this much for shampoo and conditioner... but man, does it make my curls bouncy and shiny. Great stuff, delivered on time and a bit less expensive than buying directly from a salon.
"
"
Absolutely love this duo.  Makes my fine curls soft, healthy and shiny.  I have ordered a backup duo, a must have or me!
"
"
Love this stuff! Great for curls! Takes a little getting used to (no suds), but cleans and works great L
"
"
Excellent conditioner for curly hair. Adds body and counteracts frizzies.
"
"
I have fine, very curly hair and DevaCurl neither dries it out or weighs it down.  Great product.
"
"
I've been using these DevaCurl products for years now.  Thanks to my granddaughter who turned me on to them.
"
"
DevaCurl is a very good product at a great price.  This product provides delicate conditioning on curly hair and is worth the buy.
"
"
Wonderful
"
"
This feels like I get a build up after a week or so. I occasionally have to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of that feel.
"
"
Love the product for my natural Curley hair!
"
"
Dont waste your money.
"
"
I like the delight better so far, this stuff smells like hippies (like nag champa and flowers).
"
"
This is my go-to shampoo and conditioner for natural wavy hair. No more poodle head! The pumps are nice, but it would be good to get regular caps, too, so I can turn the bottles over as they run out.
"
"
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! PRODUCT!!
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Happy curls :)
"
"
Hydrates my curls perfectly
"
"
Love the product.  Best thing for curly hair.  However, I wish the supplier would package it better.  Everytime I receive my shampoo/conditioner, the pump is broken or the top had come off and product has leaked out.  Not enough to ask for a new product, just annoying.
"
"
Great for my oh so fuzzy hair. Worked wonderfully
"
"
Fake product-not the original DevaCurl. Has a horrible smell and left my hair dry.
"
"
love it
"
"
Love
"
"
Amazing products and the shipment was perfect!
"
"
I love that these come together and for a reasonable price.  I tried the low-poo shampoo and did not like it at all.  After using it and rinsing it out, it felt like there was a weird film over my hair.  Almost as if I smeared pure aloe goo on it.  But the no-poo is so awesome!  No filmy feeling an soft defined curls. Plus I love the scent of both the no-poo shampoo and the one condition separately but when you us them together, the scent is magical!  I love that this doesn't smell like a sweet fruit basket.
"
"
seriously amazing. hair looks and smells great
"
"
I have used both the no-poo and the one condition for over 3 years with great success. I no longer have snarls at the nape of my neck and I have curls instead of frizz!
"
"
Good product at an amazing price. Almost half the price of what salons charge
"
"
Amazing!  Great price, quick shipping, and lasted for a month which is great since we use it on our three kids with thick curly hair.
"
"
don't ;ike
"
"
Love it ... will definitely purchase again
"
"
Awesome shampoo!!! The more I use it tge better my hair feels.  A little goes a a long way.  It makes my curls look wonderful. Great price on Amazon.  Will last for several months.
"
"
Game changer for curly haired girls!
"
"
this is not the true product.
"
"
Absolutely love these products.  I will never use anything else.
"
"
Best 'shampoo' ever!!! I have naturally curly hair and it gets FRIZZY easily. I've bought and tried so many products. I tried a sample of Deva Curl when I was in New Oreleans  and LOVED!! Found it on Amazon stocked up!!!!
"
"
it is good for my curly hair
"
"
love it
"
"
Very happy with this product.
"
"
This product itches my scalp.
"
"
Love love love these products! My hair feels so much happier than it used to. Only issue is that the pump for my conditioner doesn't work 😞
"
"
VERY satisfied.  Great product and delivered on time and not left where the dog could open first!
"
"
Something in it was making my hair fall off like crazy.
"
"
My husband and I both have curly hair and avoid harsh products. We both especially like the gentle No Poo.
"
"
My order delivered the next day, shipping was fast, thank you. The products is good, its perfect for people who has curler or beach waves hair. But it does small a little like some other people said in their review. Over all, I think this is a good hair set.
"
"
So much better for my daughter's long curly hair than other shampoos. Her hair is not as dry and easier to detangle.
"
"
Love the chemical free shampoo set.  Works great for natural curly hair.
"
"
I love how well this product cleanses and conditions my hair. I am a fan of the light clean scent. 110% satisfied!
"
"
Product is amazing.. seller not so much
"
"
Love it!!! Great product and priced perfectly :)
"
"
Great product for curly hair!
"
"
Love it! Thank you Amazon for having this available for half the price as you would get them in the salon! Can't beat this price and to get them prime shipping is awesome!
"
"
Everything OK. I've been using these products for years, I already know its quality.
"
"
Awesome product!!
"
"
not real thing
"
"
DEVA CURL for life
"
"
The only stuff I will use on my hair.
"
"
I have used the conditioner for over 4 years. I felt that this bottle had been watered down. The conditioner was thin and runny.  Not happy and will not buy from this seller.
"
"
love. a must. I always have it on hand
"
"
if you have curly hair this is all you should ever use
"
"
I have used this product from the store and loved it, but when I received these products they smell poorly and even stung my scalp a little.
"
"
My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner for my curly hair !! Truly makes a difference !! I can never go without it.
"
"
Disappointed by whole system. Doesn't leave my hair soft and de tangled. My sister uses this product and recommended to me. However not for me
"
"
Nice
"
"
My wife has used these items for several years and loves them.
"
"
Best shampoo and conditioner for curly girls great savings buying it on Amazon
"
"
Awesome stuff for dry hair.
"
"
Best shampoo and condition for curly hair.
"
"
I have been using DevaCurl NoPoo and One Condition for 4 years now. My hair is the healthiest it has ever been. My curly-headed son has started using these two products as well. His hair loves it!
"
"
works good, daughter said it works really well
"
"
love it My daughter in law put me on this product.  I use nothing else.  even my hair dresser said my hair is softer not so dry
"
"
Must have for anyone battling curly hair. :)
"
"
Bottles were filled with a different brand of shampoo and conditioner. It was not Diva curl.
"
"
Amazing product line. Since using it as directed my hair looks finally looks, smells and feels consistently amazing ♡
"
"
These products are the best out there for us curly-girls.  One you discover them and start using them, there is no turning back.
"
"
I really can't stress how much deva curl has completely changed my curl life. I have a teenager when I discovered no poo. After I started dyeing it I used one condition and my hair was saved. Also this set is authentic.
"
"
Great products for curly girls.
"
"
This stuff is absolutely magic! I have really curly and frizzy hair that gets brittle if I use anything too harsh. Deva Curl is the only shampoo/conditioner I've found that makes my hair feel soft and actually reduces the frizz. And it also smells good :)
"
"
Great product for curly hair
"
"
I love this stuff.  Got it for my friends daughter who has really curly hair. .. They love it... No tangles!!
"
"
It smells great, makes my scalp feel wonderful, sorta gets rid of my dandruff with the mint in it and all. but all in all it didn't really do what I had expected it to do to my hair. but that could be on account of my hair being totally impenetrable by absolutely any shampoo. so I gave it three because it still does pretty good on my scalp.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Great Product
"
"
Great products.
"
"
I've used these haircare products for several years. The shampoo doesn't dry my  hair, my natural curl responds well to the line.
"
"
Would buy this again and again. Perfect on curly hair. Check YouTube for instructions on how to use it properly.
"
"
love love love....couldn't imagine a day without my curls
"
"
Hands down best product for Curls
"
"
Item arrived on time, as described!
"
"
Love this stuff! It's the only product that will consistantly get all the tangles out of my child's hair and leaves it soft
"
"
Fast delivery and an amazing product.
"
"
Great for my hair!!
"
"
great product. never used anything like it before! curls are looking better already. arrived very quickly. i would definitely recommend to others.
"
"
My hair dresser suggested this product to me and found it on line and ordered it. I used it for last few moth, and lost half of my hair. So awful product.
"
"
Perfect for my thin curly hair. Great products.
"
"
great products, love the conditioner! Makes my kids hair feel like silk!
"
"
Love this stuff!!!  Keeps my hair healthy.
"
"
A+
"
"
It shipped quickly, but it smelled kind of different than the smaller DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition I had purchased earlier, and had a different consistency. After using it for a while, my hair isn't quite as soft as it was with the earlier products I was using, but I guess that could be the seasonal change? But after reading other reviews commenting on the smell and wondering if it was different, makes me think it's a different product. Knock-off?
"
"
For curly hair, this is the only way to fly!  All other hair products are gone!
"
"
Really like this combo. Hair is soft, and experience less fall-out that using store brand conditioner.
"
"
I've been using Devacurl products forever, and they are hands-down the best for curly hair. The shampoo has the best smell of any product too, which is just a double-win. However, the conditioner I bought from here smells nothing like the Devacurl conditioner I'm used to. The smell is drastically different and it doesn't work for me at all. The real product is a 10/10, but what I got from Amazon is not the same product I've bought for years. Almost tempted to give it away and buy the real thing at a salon.
"
"

"
"
works great on my course curly hair - even when I straighten it.
"
"
This product doesn't even deserve one star I think this is a faulty product from this company because when I've used devacurl before I loved it this just made my hair frizzy
"
"
Best Shampoo I have ever used. I have fine hair and color my hair. My hair is full and does not lose the color as fast as most other salon shampoos. I have tried most salon shampoos - this is my favorite.
"
"
Okay, so the title sounds rather dramatic but combined with a Deva haircut, these products rule! I've been using the products for about a month and two weeks and my hair is in excellent conditions and my curls are happy and healthy. Following the directions and using a t-shirt to scrunch after washing makes all the difference.
"
"
I live for these! Great for curly girls!
"
"
This is a great product for curly hair, colored hair, or hair of any kind really.  Use it and see!
"
"
I started using Deva products about 2 years ago.  I have very curly hair that easily becomes a frizzy rats nest.  I haven't used a brush in almost 2 years.  And everyone compliments me on my hair.  Shiny, healthy and completely under control.
"
"
I am not the one to write reviews, but this product deserves it. With just one wash, it makes a significant difference on my hair! i love it !
"
"
love deva products
"
"
I love these products!
"
"
Fast delivery and great product
"
"
All the Curly girl stuff is awesome!
"
"
This is either old product or false product. I will attempt to return.
"
"
Love this stuff! It's a bit pricey but helps keep the friz from happening. My hair has grown an inch since I started using it. As well as it looks and feels so much healthier. If you have curly hair this is the stuff to buy. This and an old t-shirt instead of a towel and your hair will be happy.
"
"
I was hoping it would help me have fuller curls than my other shampoo but it didn't seem to do that.  Other than that, it is a good product.
"
"
Great product, great price, fast shipping!
"
"
It came fast , it's working very good for my curly hair
"
"
I have fine, curly hair. DevaCurl is all I've been using for the last 3 months and my hair stays curly, soft and less frizzy than ever.
"
"
My daughter has curly and dry hair and loved this shampoo and the conditioner.  My old hair is a little less curly and a lot drier.  I tried this for a week and was amazed at the difference.  Finally, I found treatments that work!
"
"
I paid 60 dollars for my package....one bottle arrives exploded and unusable.
"
"
My curls love Deva Curl products!!
"
"
Girls is your hair is curly, these are the products to own. Just make sure you drip dry.
"
"
This was an excellent deal!  I love the shampoo and conditioner, you only need a small amount so this should last months!  You can't beat the price difference!!
"
"
Deva curl products have changed my life. Well, maybe not my Life, but my hair looks great all the time now. Thank you do much Divs Curl!
"
"
I'm a new deva curl user and I must say that my 3b type curls are bouncier and springier than ever. I only have to wIsh my hair about 1 time a week with the no poo. Compared to at least 3 times a week with regular shampoo and comditioner. My dandruff has gone away and frankly inlove the lemon grass smell. Its so fresh and invigorating.
"
"
one of the containers leaked out
"
"
Product is great. Packaging not so much. Pump discharged in package. Everything was covered in conditioner.
"
"
Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever had! I have been using this brand for about 2 years now. I have naturally curly hair and Deva Curl does not dry out my hair and it is not tangled when I get out of the shower.
"
"
Great product. Highly recommend it to others.
"
"
This duo works for my 3b hair better than the Ouidad line.  Price is best I've seen online also.
"
"
I ordered this product from Amazon because it was much cheaper than salons, and will de ordering it from here from now on. Love this duo for my curls.
"
"
The  shipping was fastThe produc. Excellent
"
"
Excellent i love this product and i recieved in good packaging and fast delivery!
"
"
Love DevaCurl!  Love the scent and it works well with my hair!
"
"
I love Deva Curl light gel. Best thing ever!  This set, not so much.  My hair seems drier and harder to get curl.  Would not buy again.
"
"
Love these products.
"
"
I love this deva curl combo, but after paying $60+ I would expect sufficient packaging for it not to arrive with more of the product out of the bottle than in.
"
"
Finally a product that works with my curly hair.  Keeps it from flying away and bushing out.  Love it.
"
"
Bought wrong version needed low poo
"
"
Wonderful product. Fast shipping.
"
"
I'm a first time user/buyer so don't know old vs. new. I  purchased on the recommendation of my hair stylist. I love the products. I have fine, flyaway hair that can be very dry. I was just using Dove shampoo and conditioner and it would be oily on top and dry on the bottom. We are on well water also which doesn't help. Since I started using these products my hair just seems more normalized. It's not too dry or too oily. It feels soft and has nice volume. I even look better in pictures! And whatever I bought smells really nice. I was thinking that yesterday in the shower. I'm a happy girl with this product.
"
"
Awesome for my curls! Love it!
"
"
I love all the Deva Curl products. They work amazing!
"
"
These products are expensive, but well worth it.  My scalp feels fresher longer, my hair is healthier, and I don't have to wash it every day.
"
"
These are fine, but, after a while it is hard to get them out of the spout in the bottle.
"
"
very good shampoo
"
"
This is the way to buy these products.  They will transform your curly hair!  The book, Curly Girl, explains it all.
"
"
Love these Deva products
"
"
The best shampoo and conditioner ever for those with naturally curly hair!!
"
"
Great product
"
"
This is the best shampoo and conditioner for curly hair. Every now and then I try different brands, but I always come back to Diva products to fix what the other products did.
"
"
The product is perfect
"
"
I use nothing else
"
"
I like the product very much. The NOPOO smells lovely and works easily and well. The conditioner does the job well. My only complaint is that the 32 ounce containers are too heavy to handle in the shower. One dropped out of my hands and the pump broke off when it hit the shower floor. I had to go to a beauty supply store and spend $6 on smaller plastic bottles. Then I had to use a funnel to transfer the liquids into the smaller bottles. After doing that, I discovered that the Nopoo and conditioner were too thick to come out of the new squeeze bottles I had bought. The thickness of the two products does require a pump which they came in. Now I have to unscrew th new bottles and squeeze the stuff out of the bottles. If I had to do it over again, I would buy these products but in a smaller size that would fit easily on my shower shelf and in my hands..
"
"
decent scent and seems to leave hair feeling hydrated. Only problem was cap wasn't on very tight when it was shipped so some of the conditioner leaked and made a mess in the box.
"
"
Excellent Product....
"
"
I have very curly, frizzy, coarse hair. I have tried other products and always come back to deva ( I stray and only gave 4 stars because I am not all that fond of the scent. Wish they made more choices) it is an amazing product!
"
"
Good Stuff!!
"
"
This is wonderful for my daughter's hair, it makes brushing her hair so much easier
"
"
Outstanding product,  great for beautiful curls!
"
"
As other reviewers mentioned, my bottle of No-Poo was only 3/4 full. I too wonder if this is an older formulation or product has been diluted.
"
"
Great for my fine, curly hair.
"
"
Love it! My hair is so soft and never frizzy. Each time I see the results with regular sudsing shampoo I'm more and more impressed with this product. I have fine naturally curly hair, its color treated and I get a brazilian blow out- I though this product would be ineffective against my oily scalp, but I've found that my scalp doesn't get oily anymore. Good stuff!
"
"
Love this!
"
"
Best hair product for my naturally curly hair I've found
"
"
I have super curly hair and I find that this shampoo and conditioner work great!  I don't get left with frizzies!
"
"
Brought it for my mom and she loves it. She says her hair has never felt better and it easier to manage.
"
"
The DevaCare One Condition No Fade Conditioner has a very unpleasant sour smell. Not pleasing to use on one's hair. the regular One Condition has a less offensive odor.
"
"
Well-received without delay in South Korea.
"
"
I used it in n.y.when I was a hairstylist and loved it on my customers and they loved it too....it's a great product!
"
"
Smells good and works well on my hair
"
"
I'd been struggling for years to find a product kind to my ""s'wavy"" hair, which is loosely curly, wavy, and straight at the same time. Very sensitive to climate changes and product, I wanted something to enhance the natural textures of my hair. These products are it. I've gotten huge compliments on my hair since I started using deva curl. I'll never use anything else again.
"
"
I will gladly shell out more for something that works so well with my curls!
"
"
Everyone always compliments me on my hair...I am certain it is because of this shampoo.  I'll never switch again.
"
"
I have curly hair and it is a frizzy rat's nest without this shampoo. I love this shampoo and conditioner!
"
"
This is the best shampoo and conditioner, by far, that I've used on my daughter's curly hair. It keeps it nice and shiny while allowing each ""curl family"" to look bouncy and healthy.  I just wish the smell wasn't as strong. It's very perfumey.
"
"
Really good for curly hair. Smells good, too.
"
"
Ive been using this for a while. I will never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner
"
"
I have used these products for years. They work great with my Curls and make them easy to manage.
"
"
I use this on my 3 year old daughters hair. She is mixed with soft kinky curly hair. This really makes her curls come alive!!! It smells great and really gets out the tangles. I highly recommend this product!
"
"
Its not the real product. Its very very watered down!

I'm very pleased, and I will purchase it again. The bottles will be lasting me about 4 months at the rate I see now
"
"
Delivery was made even sooner then I expected.
"
"
My hair doesn't stay clean as long as it use to with other products. But it should be healthier for me so I'll just wash it every other day instead of every 3 days.
"
"
I am very disappointed that I spent the money on this. I've used this product for five years and THIS is not the same product. It does not moisturize my hair at all. I kept adding more trying to get it to work as usual but it just dried my hair out worse. I highly disappointed and highly frustrated.
"
"
my favorite!
"
"
They arrived fast and were a great price.
"
"
I love this shampoo and conditioner combo! I've been using it for 3 years now and I would never think of trying a different brand! My only complaint is for the seller- my NoPoo wasn't full
"
"
I've fought the frizz of curly hair for years.  I definitely see a difference with these products.  So much less frizz.
"
"
Love the product, but it was shipped opened with the pumps already inserted, which caused the product to leak out everywhere during shipment
"
"
Received in timely manner with no defects!
"
"
Curly Girl products and methods are simple and work for my curls. I only wish I had known about it years ago.
"
"
Excellent product,  would definitely recommend it to anyone who has out of control frizzy hair. After one use of this product could see results immediately.
"
"
my hair used to be curly. but then i never took care of it. now it is curly again. good product.
"
"
I was expecting the white bottle with the green label.
"
"
Fast delivery and great product.
"
"
best price i have found
"
"
After years of straightening my hair, I have finally given in to my natural texture.  A friend with beautiful natural curls recommended this line, and I love it.  The shampoo (called No Poo) is similar to a cleansing conditioner.  It doesn't make suds but it does make your hair feel clean.  The conditioner is great for dry hair.  I love the large size with the dispenser pumps.  It makes it really economical and easy to use.
"
"
The smell is like that of a household cleaner in my opinion. I haven't noticed a big difference in my hair's moisture or frizz, so I'm still testing it out.
"
"
Great product for natural curly hair.
"
"
I love the product! But I couldnt open any of the pumps one even ended up breaking
"
"
Exactly as promised -- A+
"
"
Love this line of shampoo and conditioners!! I have been looking for a gentle shampoo for my curly hair for many years. This one is the best.
"
"
DevaCurl is the est I've found for my curls yet!
"
"
Not what I expected. I can't wait to finish it.
"
"
Love these products they help my hair.
"
"
Deva brings back my curls even when my curls lose they're pattern due to extreme dryness. Best product on the market to nourish my thirsty curls.
"
"
Love it! Smells fantastic, does wonders for my curly locks, and my hair looks healthier :)
"
"
Love this stuff!
"
"
My wife received a 16 oz bottle in a gift pack as a Christmas gift. She loves how it tames her curls yet still leaves body!
"
"
My favorite line for my thick curly hair. Always keeps my hair soft and frizz free!
"
"
This duo pack is definitely the best deal around...A good bang for your buck. These products are amazing and in this jumbo size will last quite awhile.
"
"
Love this product as usual, it's a great product for curls (especially if you suffer from dry hair like me). Also the shipping was prompt and in good condition, thanks!
"
"
My favourite product EVER!
"
"
Love this product makes my curls really soft.
"
"
My favorite shampoo and conditioner make my hair so soft and easy to detangle.
"
"
I get complements all the time now on my hair. I tell everyone that it's Devacurls. I've found for the best results follow with Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel.
"
"
The title clearly states one conditioner + no poo, however the package is 2 bottles of the same no poo shampoo. Disappointed, need to purchase conditioner separately.
"
"
This is the best shampoo/conditioner for naturally curly hair!!! Love it!!!
"
"
This product is perfect.
"
"
Product came well wrapped. Took me a while to get used to no suds, but now love it. Makes my curly hair feel soft & frizz free.
"
"
Loved the product.
"
"
It worked great
"
"
My girlfriend LOVE it!
"
"
The Deva products never dis appoint!!! My only issue is the shampoo pump head was cracked and I've had to rig a system up to use it.
"
"
Great product.  Not too heavy. Leaves my hair manageable and helps with the frizz.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Awesome shampoo for people with curly hair. Although it's a tad expensive, it leaves my hair soft and silky after each wash
"
"
I love this conditioner, defines curls and has eliminated any frizz from my curly/wavy hair.The pump at the top of the bottle was broken, but the actual conditioner is fantastic.
"
"
Best shampoo and conditioner
"
"
Love!
"
"
Love this product.
"

I do really like tris stuff ;) been using it hor almost a year now and I love it so much
"
"
I have been using these products for 2 years and I love what it does to my hair!
"
"
I have natural curly hair...and DevaCurl makes my hair look great..my curls bounce...I use Dive No poo(shampoo)...and Devacurl Conditioner.. Yes its costly but worth every penny

"
"
❤️
"
"
Best product for curly hair .
"
"
Great products pleased that my stylist introduced me to them.
"
"
Order fulfilled
"
"
Favorite poo and conditioner around for my curls! Love the big bottles. I use them to refill my small travel sizes too!
"
"
Great deal Sent quickly Very Happy!! Would order again!
"
"
these combination works so well on my dry brittle hair.  The no-poo cleans my hair without removing moisture, and the conditioner thick and smells great!
"
"
Product arrived damaged. So frustrating.
"
"
GREAT PRODUCT
"
"
Best curly hair shampoo products. Make my curls look their best.
"
"
My hair is so much more heathy.
"
"
Waste of money. Foul odor and poor cleansing.
"
"
I have been using this product for about one and one half years and love it.  I will definitely keep using it
"
"
Great product recommend it to anyone with mixed or curly hair even kinky tight hair can benefit!!
"
"
It brings out the natural curl
"
"
Liked the organic ingredients but my hair was never shiny.
"
"
been using for over a year love it and this is the best price
"
"
I purchased a while back, and only ran out recently. When I went to open my most recent purchase of the product, it was a different color and had a different scent. On closer inspection, the label says deva care, not deva curl. I'm outside the return window at this point, so I'll consider it a lesson learned about checking the package contents carefully.In general, I love the genuine product, but am more likely to get it at a local salon in the future.
"
"
These are awesome products!
"
"
Works well with my very dry hair, especially the shampoo.
"
"
Absolutely LOVE this product!!!
"
"
A great product! My hair has never felt so good!!
"
"
I have been using these hair products for many years and I love them. This set is a pretty good deal. It's not pictured but the bottles come with pumps which was a pleasant surprise since I usually save a pump from an old bottle just in case.
"
"
It is horrible, didn't do anything, my hair felt like never washed greasy after use. don't buy
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Love it!  My hair is looking healthier and my curls look beautiful!!
"
"
i love this product. have been using it for a year. it brings out the curl in your hair and takes away the frizzy.
"
"
This stuff is the saving grace for my natural curly hair.  Plus it smells lovely!
"
"
Love!
"
"
I like this product but my hair seems to get very tangled please can deva curls recommend something for the tangling area to make it easier to maintain but other than that I love it
"
"
My hair has never felt better healthy soft n hydrated!!!
"
"
Love it deva no poo.
"
"
Yes
"
"
Very happy with product and price. Will continue to order
"
"
The pump for one of the bottles was not attached when I opened the package leaving space for bacteria and small particles to get in. Ew.
"
"
My curls love this stuff but my scalp says otherwise. I never feel clean after shampooing, even after really scrubbing away. I started using some actual shampoo in conjunction with the No-Poo and it feels better but i'm still not sold. The conditioner is nice and acts just like typical conditioners.
"
"
Everything came on time but the bottle was open & some spilled out
"
"
Quick delivery, product is exactly as described.  THANK YOU
"
"
Hard to get used to at first with no foam, but it does amazing things for my hair! So manageable, and not dry at the ends anymore!!! Glad I found it!
"
"
Great Product Love It!!!
"
"
Where has this been all my life?
"
"
Absolutely love these products!! Perfect for thick, curly and unruly hair A+++
"
"
i love this product!!
"
"
The only thing is the bottle exploded and my mother was disappointed on that
"
"
Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner tame curly hair. The product helps moisturizer my daughter's hair and tame the curls and frizz.
"
"
Defines curly hair and keeps the frizz down. I use the whole line of Devacare products and get lots of compliments on my hair.
"
"
will buy more
"
"
I have super kinky curly blonde hair and heard about this stuff from a stylist it is the best product I have ever used my hair is bouncy and shiny instead of frizzy. It.is.magical.
"
"
No complaints
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl for years. This is a first time I decided to buy it from Amazon. What I got does not look or smell like the DevaCurl products I'm used to. Both shampoo and the conditioner are pinkish color (it's supposed to be white!..) and the smell is not the smell I'm used to. Not sure what this is. My hair also feels quite dry and dull, and believe me I do know how to use these products... Returning the whole thing including the gel.
"
"
Makes the perfect curl!
"
"
love the products. delivered on time.
"
"
This is how I received my order without a pump and broken.Thank you!!!!!
"
"
Good product. i like the products of deva care.I recomend this product . i will buy this a another ocasion
"
"
Best thing ever for long curly hair!  Every time I try to use something else, I end up coming right back to it.
"
"
I LOVE the DevaCurl products, they cleanse and hydrate my wavy/curly hair like no other and all silicone /sulfate free!
"
"
Great!
"
"
Has changed the way I handle my hair.  I'm very satisfied with these products and the results I get.  My hair is finally maanageable.
"
"
Great product! It cane quicker than expect and I got it the cheapest here.
"
"
love the product. Amazon makes it easy.Thanks,Susan
"
"
Product was as expected and delivered promptly.
"
"
I'm a single mom. I don't splurge on much... But I love DevaCurl! Unfortunately I was very disappointed by this shipment. It arrived quickly but had not been packaged properly and it had leaked out all over. So with my busy mom schedule I had to take time to clean up the mess it made. And lose our on the wasted  product. Then first time using the conditioner it had a stale smell and was more runny than it should have been. I'm not sure what happened to it but it's very disappointing considering how expensive this product is. Now I will have to reorder the conditioner (from a different supplier). No way can I use what I received.
"
"
Great!
"
"
Awesome!!!!!
"
"
Great value thru amazon. Bye bye Ulta
"
"
I will admit I didn't want to give into the Deva Curl hype at first because I thought the products were too expensive, but choosing to invest in my hair was the best decision I could've ever made! I have 3c type hair and always struggled with finding the right products to define my curls until now. The No-Poo and One Conditioner have givin me the most POPPIN curls I've had in my life! My curls are now super defined, shiny and they smell great. EVERY curly girl needs to invest in some Deva Curl products ASAP!
"
"
Great product for curly hair.
"
"
Cetearyl Alcohol the SECOND ingredient in BOTH?!!  Really?  Like not way down the list, but the second highest level ingredient in both bottles! Hello dry hair in the long run....
"
"
I've been using DevaCurl products for  a few years, and it never lets me down. It makes my curls have definition and shine.
"
"
Made my hair so greasy. It was caked into my scalp and nothing worked to get it out. Hated it.
"
"
I really love this stuff for the softness and it helps my wavy hair actually get to curly. The rosemary smell is wonderful too. I'm not sure the smell of the conditioner but it's nice.The downside is that my hair has vibrant red to yellow sections and they were lightened quite a lot by the combination of the no-poo and conditioner after only one wash. I'm very sad about that as I only had my hair dyed in the last 2 weeks. I'm going to try it again with only the conditioner but if that doesn't help then I'll have to return it.
"
"
Love this stuff  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
"
I'm happy with my purchase
"
"
this stuff is fabulous
"
"
Excellent condition for curly hair
"
"
My favorite hair products!
"
"
Bought this for my boyfriend who has naturally curly hair. Its a must have if you have the kind of curls that fluff up and you want them to stay down rather than ""poof out"". Definitely worth the extra $$ to have nice hair.
"
"
Love it and Arrived quickly !
"
"
Love there product line !!
"
"
This conditioner smells amazing! The No-Poo is leaving my hair really greasy. I heard this is just a phase, but I can't stand it. I switch on and off with another shampoo.
"
"
Love this!
"
"
Excellent
"
"
The seller replaced the actual Deva products with some sort of hand lotion or other terrible smelling product. These are not the same color or consistency as the Deva products. Don't buy from them!
"
"
Product does the trick in being gentle on hair, but it doesn't support curls. My hair looked and felt the same as when I used Head and Shoulders. I'm a mixed ethnicity half black so my hair is very curly.
"
"
Unfortunately I bought this by mistake. I love the No-Poo DevaCare. What a big difference. This has a strong scent and does not work on my hair. It doesn't give my hair body. Maybe this would be good for thick hair?
"
"
I love the Devacurl line of products! I have wavy hair and these products have made me love my hair. Amazon has a great price on this duo too
"
"
Too notch!
"
"
Great product for a great price!  My 7 year old's hair is curly and dry and this is a great product to protect them!  Until she is old enough to care for her own hair, I'll continue to use this product line.
"
"
DevaCurl products are the best.  If u r curly girl this the the product for u. Im only sorry that it took so many years for me to find out about the products and the special hair stylist that knows how to cut curly hair. Hands down the best. Katrina at CURLS ROCK, Boca Raton, Fl.
"
"
You have to get passed the fact that there are no suds, which make the shampoo feel like it is not cleaning properly.  It is the chemicals that cause the shampoos to suds up so clearly this product has 0 chemicals.  The product is great and has done wonders for my hair.  It looks and feels different and noticed by many  of my friends.
"
"
I was excited to try this shampoo and conditioner because I had heard and read nothing but good things about it. However, I was left disappointed. My hair was dull and dry. I wasn't fond of the smell either. I have naturally curly hair that is overly processed and this product did absolutely nothing for me. :( waste of money.
"
"
Today I received my package the no Poo leaked I lost half of the bottle not happy yes I could send it back half empty but is it worth it
"
"
Smells great but really doesn't give a nice clean.
"
"
COCONUT!!!!!! it is my ultimate pic!
"
"
been using for a year now. Love this
"
"
So far not too bad, has a different texture to it than normal shampoo and conditioner and helps with frizz
"
"
Perfect!  Fast shipping!
"
"
Supposed to enhance curl. Did not.
"
"
i HAVE TRIED QUITE A FEW PRODUCTS FOR MY CURLY FRIZZY HAIR. THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST. I WATCHED THE DEVA CURL VIDEOS AND HAVE BEEN DRYING MY HAIR NATURALLY AND IT IS SHINY AND BOUNCY. LOVE IT. SMELLS GOOD TOO.
"
"
I love the Devacurl line and I usually buy from local salon. Shampoo in this package is great, conditioner seems watered down to me, compared to other bottles of the same conditioner I have used.
"
"
Love this product. However, the pump on the product is usually broken and won't pump the product out.  That is very frustrating.
"
"
My daughter and I started using this in August 2012, and we love it. It seems pricey but buying it this way is a better deal than shopping at brick and mortar store Ulta. For the One Condition, we don't first put it in and rinse and then add more to leave in. We only use it as a leave in, per the instructions from the stylist who cut my daughter's hair (10 inches for Locks of Love) taking her to a short, curly style!
"
"
Other reviewers said they received older versions of the products in the past, so I was a bit nervous, but I just got my package and the products are legitimately  from DevaCurl, just like the ones in the photograph. The bottles had masking tape applied to the pumps to prevent leakage -- that was a good idea and I'm glad they were well packed.I love DevaCurl's original No-Poo and One Condition, they are the best products for my very fine curly hair and I have been using them for over a year. This was the first time I bought the large bottles from Amazon and I'm happy it worked out!
"
"
I should have ordered the smallest size to try this. You will reek for days even after trying to wash it out with other product.
"
"
I have curly/wavy hair and I have fallen in love with the DevaCurl products. It took about a month to acclimate to it, but my hair is consistently softer than before and looks great!
"
"
I love this product been using for over a year makes my curls look amazing!!!!
"
"
I just bought my second round of the 32 ounce bottles.  These products WORK! My daughter and I both have thick curly hair.  Since we have started using, both of our hair is easier to manage and I get compliments all the time on how nice my hair looks.  Curly hair can be hard to manage, it is nice to have a product that works well and doesn't dry it out or make it look dull.
"
"
One of the bottles arrived leaking, but I like the Deva product line.
"
"
great!
"
"
I live overseas, and often times beauty products will not be available to ship to APO addresses, but all stars beauty did with no problem. My product arrived very promptly (within a week.) The only negative was that the shampoo had opened during shipping, and some of the contents had leaked out. I contacted the seller and they sent a replacement bottle at no charge immediately. I will definitely be buying all my products from now on from this seller, and will be recommending their site. Love the product as well!!!
"
"
keeps my hair from thinning! Great curls.
"
"
I'm converted!
"
"
Love this product. The best out there for curly hair.
"
"
It doesn't smell as good as it used to. They
"
"
I love the DevaCurl! I have purchased about every product out that claims to prevent FRIZ and give soft natural curls BUT this shampoo and conditioner has actually done it!! I may stop getting my hair colored now it is that good! I get complements on my hair daily!! Thank You!!
"
"
I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better! I use the B'Leave in Curl Booster, the Set It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition and I love all of them.I have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair. I am so glad my stylist put me on to it. WOOHOO!! I will be using these products from now on!
"
"
The conditioner bottle cracked and spilled all over the box... Waste of expensive product
"
"
fake fake fake fake fake fake fake
"
"
Not good at all
"
"
it came broken when i open the package and stunk up my house. I bought this for a friend and it also came late
"
"
What I hate is that I never received the conditioner
"
"
LOVE.  These products leave your hair feeling soft and manageable, but also totally clean.  There's a slight mentholness to the no-poo that feels great on your scalp, and the conditioner is very rich and creamy.  I converted to these products over two years ago, and I've never looked back-- they're an absolute godsend for my coarse, frizzy hair.I give samples to my friends and family all the time, and I've converted almost all of them.  This is a SUPER deal to test the products and see for yourself.AND they don't test on animals.  Yay!
"
"
I bought this for my wife for Christmas. Product was not authentic as it is advertised. If it it truly is from DevaCurl, then I think it is probably the botched runs of the product. This stuff stinks very badly. It does not have the same color, same fragrance, or same consistency of the DevaCurl you get at the salon. I was hero for a week or two when I got it for my wife for Christmas. Now I have to go pay full price at a salon because my wife won't use it in her hair (which I am glad because I would have to live in the guest house in the back because I an;t take the smell). We tried to use it on the kids so it wasn't completely wasted, but we promptly sent them outside to play in the mud so they could try and get the stink out of their hair. It started to dissipate after 3 or 4 days and washing with 2 other shampoos. I would recommend you pay the money an go to a salon or also invest in nose plugs.
"
"
I purchased this item from the DevaCurl website and I purchased the Quit My Shampoo pack, that way I could give it a good try without spending an arm and a leg. The smell is a little overwhelming and doesn't fade much after rinsing but I got used to it after a few uses. My main issue was that it doesn't wash styling product out of your hair very well. The first day I used it I had to wash twice to get everything out of my hair. The second day I used the DevaCurl hairspray instead of my usual (thinking it might wash out better) and I had to scrub even harder and still don't feel like I got all of it out. The 3rd day my hair felt super greasy. I didn't even use the conditioner and stood in the shower and scrubbed and rinsed several minutes after I thought I got everything out and once it dried not only did it still feel greasy but it dried crunchy like there was STILL hairspray in it!In my opinion, for 8x the cost of normal shampoo it should kick butt and it just didn't.
"
"
I have curly hair that has a tendency to frizz. I received these products as a gift from a curly hair friend.  I LOVE it.  The feel and smell is healthy, gentle and amazing. It leaves my curls defined and frizz free.  Follow instructions and watch the video as well as it shows you certain tricks to help as well such as using a microfiber towel to dry your hair.  The shampoo doesn't sud much (get over that:-) you don't need to use much.  I don't wash my hair everyday with shampoo as well.  I use the conditioner alone in between shampooing and make sure to not wash it off completely. I am very satisfied.
"
"
IF YOU HAVE SPENT YOUR LIFE FIGHTING FRIZZ, AND WISHING YOU HAD STRAIGHT HAIR, THE BATTLE IS OVER!  I am writing this so at least one less curly haired person will no longer suffer!  After blowdrying, using straightening irons, not leaving the house without checking therelative humidity (as a teen I tied my hoodie tightly under my neck to avoid frizz at the bus top), all culminating in three Brazilian straightening treatments which made me almost bald from breakage, DEVA CURL HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.  No blow dryer (unless it's theirs), no brushes, sprays, and countless dollars on products that do not work - I HAVE THE MOST GORGEOUS NO FRIZZ CURLS EVER!  I'm getting compliments right and left, and best of all, I am finally liberated, because these products truly, really bring out the best in your natural curl.  From the no-poo and conditioner to the gels, creams and sprays, you cannot go wrong.  I recommend watching YouTube videos on how to use these products properly - I promise by round 3 or 4 (I wash my hair every 3 days or so) you will be thrilled! Second and third day hair can be even better than first day hair.  While they aren't cheap, I'd much rather spend the money and feel great than waste money on what doesn't work.  Than you DevaCurl!

I love this shampoo and conditioner like no other. A few months back got the smaller 12 oz. bottles but now I'm going for the big long-lasting bottles. I was a little skeptical about it at first because I'm so used to the bubbly and foamy shampoos, and I have naturally curly hair that I'm trying to grow out more. The smell is AMAZING. If you wash your hair in the morning before starting your day the shampoo releases this sweet, minty, flowery, just delicious scent which is so invigorating.The conditioner is much the same. It's refreshing and tingling and it's just a great way to start your day. It's also a great release from all the other coconut/shea butter/olive oil scented shampoos that other curly hair products seem to love.Also it cleans your hair very well. I thought I would have to wash three or four times to feel like it's really clean but wash once maybe twice like any other shampoo and you're good. Since I got this shampoo I got a lot of compliments on how good my hair smells and it's true, the scent stays with you most of the day. Sometimes the wind will blow or whatever and you think ""Oh that's nice, what is that smell? Oh! It's my hair!"" <<Thought that a lot. That may bother some people but personally I like it.Anyways DevaCurl No-poo is definitely worth it and you should give it a go. If you're still skeptical do what I did and start with the 12oz bottles or the even smaller travel size bottles they have.
"
"
The shampoo has a absolutely horrible chemical smell. I washed my hair last night and kept waking up because of the smell. The read other reviews about smelling like a ‘perm’. They are tight. Luckily I didn’t but the product but received a sample at a store. I may consider using the leave-in conditioner since it doesn’t seem to smell bad. Avoid. I can’t wait to wash my hair again today.
"
"
I was pretty upset when I discovered that I was getting hosed on price for my Wen order (they charged WAY more than they said they would), because not only did I lose money, but I thought I had to stop using the best hair product line I had ever had.  Really, it was a blessing in disguise, because switching to this product has given me the softest, healthiest, shiniest hair that has ever been on my head :)  When visiting home this past week, I let my mother try it one time, and she immediately went to the store and bought herself the products.  Make sure when you are using it to focus on the scalp with the shampoo, and the conditioner will be used on the rest.  I am a runner, so I have to wash my hair daily since I get pretty sweaty, but when I get days off, I can't believe how freshly washed my hair looks even after over 24 hours of not washing it (my hair used to get very greasy, very fast).  Great product for any hair type!
"

I have wavy/curly hair. Not tight, corkscrew curls or anything, just waves and some loose curls thrown in. It is INCREDIBLY EXTREMELY THICK, which makes it look awfully HUGE and puffy (as one of the other comments said, Merida huge), extremely frizzy, and very textured, so I've always had trouble finding a product that can make my hair look less… of well, all of that.But no more.DevaCurl worked miracles on my hair. My curls (and waves) look neater, more defined, shiny, and just good in general. My hair is ALOT less puffy, too. (I also use the AnGEL when my hair is air drying) It didn't help all that much with the frizz, but it makes my hair very soft. For the frizz I do a tiny squirt of the John Frieda Frizz-Ease on my hair. I love the smells, too. The No-Poo smell is not my favorite, but I think One Condition smells like gumdrops and AnGEL smells like peaches. If you don't like the smell at first, it will just take a while to get used to, but trust me, it's SO WORTH IT.BUT, THIS IS IMPORTANT: YOU SHOULDN'T BUY IT ONLINE! I think most salons will have it, but if they don't, ask your hair dresser. They sell it at target but in a smaller size. I have the big ones.If anyone is interested, here is my hair care routine, too:No-Pooscrunch and rub the No-Poo in your hairrinseOne Conditionscrunch and rub the One Condition in your hairrinselet your hair air dry for a little while. Then when the top is still wet but underneath is dry, squirt about the size of a nickel into your hand, rub your hands together, rub a little of your fingertips, then SCRUNCH! Scrunch it all in your hair. Don't rub it in, just scrunch!Then a tiny squirt of Frizz-Ease into your hands, rub them together, and run your hands through your hair. If you don't your hair will get gross and greasy and weighted down.Overall, an amazing product! I will definitely be getting this from my hair dresser all the time!

As a guy, I was really turned off by the name of the product...what dude wants to be a deva (diva?)? I may have not bought this product because of it. FORTUNATELY, my mother picked it up somewhere and, out of the blue, just gave it to me one day. I have REALLY curly hair and keep it sort of long. It has been a life long anxiety for me to feel like my hair looks good and have tried just about every shampoo there is but all of them frizz my hair. It got to the point where I stopped washing it...once a month tops. I just used conditioner which kind of worked...but it didn't feel ""clean"". I was dubious, but I tried it. For the 1st time I felt like I had found a product that understood my hair! I'm not the kind of guy who likes to spend a lot of time thinking about my hair and this product allows me to be the low maintenance person I generally am.
"

I'm buying my 3rd round of this 32 oz combo and I am total Devangelist!  My hair has been frizzy from puberty on to my mid-30s, when I discovered this product.  I had resigned myself to just having to be ok with super high maintenance hair that looked decent at best... at least I loved other aspects of my appearance! ... and now I just LOVE my hair!!!  Shampoo with sulphates strips your hair of oils, and your scalp then compensates by creating more oil... but with curly hair you end up with dry curls and an oily scalp.  My scalp and hair feel so balanced now and I wash my hair twice a week and it looks hydrated and not oily.I discovered this when I noticed a colleague in my office who's hair was way shinier and fuller all of the sudden and I assumed she got some special salon treatment so I asked her what it was and she said ""no-poo!""If you are switching from sulphate shampoo to no-poo I would recommend getting hair powder (dry shampoo) to tame the slight excess oiliness at first from your scalp taking a few weeks to get used to not having to produce so much oil to make up for the old oil-stripping shampoos.

I can see where this would be great for curly hair because curly hair is SO dry in nature to begin with. This stuff isn't the best smelling stuff when you are washing your hair, but it smells great when your hair has dried. My husband has super curly hair and that is why I purchased it...also hoping I could use it on my relatively straight hair and avoid the sulphates in regular shampoos. Not the case. It was great the first wash, my hair was super soft...almost too soft to do anything with actually, and it did smell great. But when I washed it today? The result was hair that looked oily and wet when completely dry. Almost as if I'd not rinsed conditioner out. I had to re-wash with regular shampoo to get it out. So. All in all, this is a no go for me. And I don't recommend it for anyone with straight hair. So far it's been fine on my husbands hair but he's not raving about any great miracle either, he likes it enough so far, but hates the price and probably will be deterred by future use on that count alone.

This stuff rocks! I read a few of the reviews and was concerned when I got the product. Deva curl has great customer service. I emailed them with the lot codes on the bottom of the No poo and the conditioner in case it was indeed old product. They emailed me the same day to let me know that the product was made in Dec 16. It has a 2 to 3 year shelf life if unopened. And 12 month self life when opened. Make sure you check them yourself. If not ask for a refund.My hair has never been in better!
"
"
I now use the Deva shampoo, conditioner, light gel and set-it-free spray. My hair is fine and curly and these products work really well with no wet look or overly crunchy. The gel does make my hair a bit tangled underneath, but that is also because my hair is fine and light weight. My only complaint is that I wish the product labels were different colors. I wear glasses, so in the shower, the shampoo and conditioner bottle look exactly the same. All of the products have the same color green labels.
"
"
Switched to this for silicone and sulfrate free ingredients. Hair is softer, but I don't think it helps much for the frizz. The scent is also not my favorite. It has a chemical smell. I'd prefer something more fruity or flower scented. I honestly think DevaCurl is overhyped.
"
"
It did make my hair a lot curler. HOWEVER,  I had a lot of hair loss. So much so, within a week my friends were noticing my hair was curler but thinner. When I returned to my Nexus products the hair loss stopped. Interestingly, I could not find a customer service number to report this to the manufacture. Please ladies beware....
"
"
Yucky!  This shampoo smells disgusting.  It is a combination of chemical and mold smell I bought at a  beauty supply store so I'm pretty sure it's the real deal but I'm really upset that I spent this much money on something I'll never use again
"
"
Like many others, I experienced a frightening amount of hair loss when using this product.  Now that WEN has a class action lawsuit for the same thing, it makes me wonder if Devacurl will be next.
"
"
I used this shampoo and conditioner (along with other Devacurl products) for six months, and in that time my hair went from being healthy and moisturized to feeling like straw and falling out in clumps. There are so many other great curly products out there -- avoid these!
"
"
Love this product! I have thick curly hair and have always found it hard to find products that will define my natural curls. I've been using devacurl for almost a month and I'm obsessed! There aren't any extra bad chemicals in the products and I know all the ingredients in these products are nourishing my hair, not harming it. My curls have never been so voluminous and defined! I'll never go back to using any other kind of hair products. Would definitely recommend to girls with curly hair.
"
"
The product itself is amazing. Five stars there. I recommend 10 out of 10 times for a ""curly girl"". However, this product was purchased with 2 day shipping. It took 9 days. In case you're in a hurry to get it, order from someone else.
"
"
I definitely recommend this product to people with curly hair, trust. I just ran out of no-poo and I got the duo (at an Ulta for more) 5months agoo. Not to mention whoo knows whose been using my shampoo in the shower.. e.e
"
"
Had iproblem with the pump on one of the bottles not working, contacted seller, they were very quick to respond and correct the problem.Would buy from seller again. Love Deva products.
"
"
First I bought the trial kit - wanted to try this product line. And I love it! No I bought big bottles. DevaCurl really helps my hair get light and curly. The smell is not so great when you wash your hair, but the curls afterwards  are just perfect. Would buy again, definitely.
"
"
This set saved my hair!! There is no more frizz or ""dead"" looking curls. I have very curly hair that is hard to tame but this, along with the styling clips and ultra defining gel works WONDERS! A MUST HAVE for curly girls.
"
"
This product was life changing for my hair! I've tried all kinds of products from the most expensive to the cheapest and nothing had worked as well as deva curl! Definitely a customer for life! And also use the coconut cream styler after you wash and condition! I use it and I no longer use hairspray!
"
"
I have been using these products for over a year now. My hair has never been this healthy. I will never use another brand again! I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and this product has changed the texture and frizz completely!
"
"
For the first time I'm able to use a conditioner and gel on my curls without having to use tons of hairspray to control my frizzy hair. My curls look much healthier, I don't even use a comb in the shower to detangle my hair only my fingers. I'm happy that my husband decided to buy me these amazing products for my hair. He loves my curly hair and he will do anything in order for me not to go straight. Lol .  Yes , its a lil pricey but worth it. Thank you DevaCurl!
"
"
This was NOT devacurl. The shampoo and conditioner smelled horrible, like rubbing alcohol and orange sherbert combined and was all goopy.  Will never buy from this seller again.
"
"
Great price--my local salon offers the 16 oz bottles for $21.  I love DevaCurl on my hair--finally tamed my mane.
"
"
Use this all the time for years.  Best product (much better than Wen) for dry wavy or curly hair.  Plus it protects from sun damage.
"
"
The two Diva products work great with my curly hair. I wish I had found it years ago. I highly recommend it
"
"
Bought the overpriced set at the store and am disappointed with the results. A lot of product build up on my scalp and very oily after one day of not washing. Lots of frizz after several hours of being dry. Will not buy again.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Not bad, but it smells weird (not fruity or like other shampoos) and dries your hair out when used together. It works best for your hair if you use the shampoo with another more moisturizing conditioner OR if you use another sulfate-free shampoo (even the low-pow would be better) and the conditioner. If you have oily hair, it's perfect.
"
"
So disappointed. When I purchased I did not read the full name this is Deva Care not Deva Curl and is not close to the original product. This is cleanser is thick and heavy and did not make my hair feel as soft as the Deva Curl. Will be more careful next time.
"
"
Really made my scalp flaky and gross for over 8 months. Finally found a shampoo that got rid of whatever this product did to my hair
"
"
I have been using them for 4 years and my curly hair is perfect!!
"
"
Buyers beware: Sellers are selling their stockpiles of much older version of this product on Amazon. I recently bought the No Poo Shampoo and One Conditioner 32oz combo. The shampoo seemed fine so I didn't think anything of it until I eventually used the conditioner. It smeller drastically different from the One Conditioner I had bought at the salon. The smell was pretty awful. Since I had the empty bottle from the salon bought conditioner, I compared the ingredients list. They were noticeable different. The smell issue is pretty bad on its own but another thing to consider as well is that this older version of the product is likely not as good as the most current formulation. I also noticed a batch number above the barcode. The number above the salon bought bottle was #2102 while the one on the bottle I bought on Amazon was #1102. I like this product but the fact that there are much older forumations of it floating around on Amazon and sellers aren't required to disclose this information makes purchasing it from Amazon problematic.
"
"
Fraudulent product! I have been a long time Deva Curl customer, and recently switched to buying it on amazon. I went to my hair stylist much sooner than I normally would because my hair was looking dry, which normally means its time for a cut. When she started washing my hair she immediately asked me where I get my product and said it was definitely not deva curl no-poo because it was foaming up as she washed it out. I was appalled, and bought some directly from deva curl (twice the price) and compared the two bottles. While they smelled similar, the one I purchased here, had a caustic smell to it as if something was added to it. It left a burning feeling in my nose. BUYER BEWARE! Buy direct from deva curl or your hair stylist! Not worth the risk.
"
"
I ordered this same set back in January of 2015 and it was authentic Deva Curl. I ran out in October and re ordered. I get a different container (no pump) which isn't a big deal. What is a big deal is right next to my last 2 bottles this stuff is very different. Smells different and both No Poo,and One Condition are yellow!!! I was curious so I called Deva Curl. The ingredient list on the side of the bottle isn't even the same. Deva Curl told me they don't put color in the no poo and one condition. They told me it was not authentic product!!!!!! Buyer beware, I want my money back!!!!!
"
"
Upon reading the reviews (AFTER I placed my order, duh) about others receiving old, or fake products, I became concerned that I wasn't going to get the real deal.  Thankfully, when I opened the box (and then the bottles, to do the sniff test) it was confirmed that these products are not only genuine DevaCurl, but they are fresh.  I notice the graphics on these bottles are different than the ones I just emptied, so the company must have changed the graphics. I am relieved that what happened to other buyers did not happen to me.
"
"
This product was terrible. From the moment it arrived it was already bad. The bottle arrived opened so there was a spillage in the bag it came with. Even though so much of the product had already spilled out, I still decided to keep it. Because of the good reviews I gave it a try and just in the first uses it dried the hair so much there was a big knot that could not be taken out and had to go to a salon. The salon was also not able to take off the knot and had no choice but to chop it off leading to an extremely short haircut. I wanted to believe it wasn’t DevaCurl even though that had never happened prior to using the shampoo and conditioner, so it was decided that the product should be given a chance and then aside from getting even more dry the product started to thin the hair and making it fall. Very unsatisfied and do not recommend to anyone.

After having to cut off all of my hair due to improper use of bleach I was afraid that my curls were gone for good. My new growth just was full of frizz and my curls had no bounce. I was seriously considering cutting it off again and sporting a cute Latina Halle Berry style but I decided to give DevaCurl a try. I cannot express how it saved my curls. DevaCurl has helped me embrace my curly hair. Instead of fighting with it on a daily basis, I just condition it and go. Seriously, I can shower and leave the house with wet hair and it will dry into beautiful spirals that are shiny and move beautifully.That being said, some of these reviews scared me a little bit. I was afraid that I was going to receive Suave conditioner in a bottle labeled DevaCurl. The packaging for this set was awesome, they were packaged so well that they could've survived a freaking apocalypse. And I am such a DevaCurl fan that I can recognize it by smell alone. It's legit. I recommend this seller for DevaCurl. Make your curls look good honey!
"

Over 5 years I've cared for my hair with natural and organic oils, shampoo and conditioner,  and wanted something new for my curly hair so I gave this a try. It was horrible! It dried my hair, which is why some apply a cream after, but when I use natural ingredients and fuse my hair, I never required in creams. This product is not for all curly hair chicks. I bought it assuming it is natural, it isnt all natural. My hair did not accept these ingredients. After 5years of treating my hair naturally, I know what is natural. This isn't, and it has some chemical ingredients.  Horrible.  It may work for those who haven't experienced an all natural treatment for 5 years liike I have, but if you only apply real ingredients,  you're hair will not accept this product.
"
"
BUYER BEWAREThis is NOT the original formula. I have been buying Devacurl for years and it has a strong fragrant smell (very pleasant), this one has an old, moldy smell!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT
"
"
This worked great the first few uses. My hair was soft and hydrated and the curls were more defined. But then I developed my classic Seborrheic Dermatitis. Itchy scalp, crusted yellow, oily, flaky lesions on my scalp and sometimes blood if itched too hard. I think it is too concentrated in oil for me so it caused me to itch and flare up (yeast likes to live where there is oil and dirt). I than had to use my special seborrheic dermatitis shampoo to stop the flare (which I hate using because it dries my hair!) The struggle is real. The conditioner worked GREAT on my ends, but I cannot and will not use the shampoo on my scalp anymore.
"
"
I fell in love with DevaCurl's Supercream and Light Defining Gel because, together, they keep my curls from frizzing without looking greasy or smelling strongly. (I work in close proximity to many people so I prefer products that are not offensive to the olfactory sense.) By using a tiny amount of Supercream and a substantial amount of Light Defining Gel, my hair holds its curl while being able to move freely. (My curls have both waves and corkscrews and get weighed-down if too much product is present.)When I tried the hair wash and conditioner, I was immediately put-off to the intense, stench from the hair wash. Nonetheless, I tried the product and the conditioner. They left my hair stinking all day and gave it a weighed-down, greasy look. I do not recommend the hair wash nor the conditioner if you want to retain the lively bounce that the Supercream and Light Defining Gel provide.
"
"
I love this 2 and they last forever. I went to the Deva Curl Salon and they recommended me not to fully rinse the conditioner. So I leave it with me and whatever is left after drying stays. Every morning, I spray water on my curls and damp then, and then I add a nut size of the conditioner instead than the usual leave-in conditioner I used before. Works great and leaves my hair awesome. If my curls feel a bit crusty, I just squeeze them enough until they get loose again, but it doesn't get frizzy!!! I'll buy again when I finish it. I only wash my hair once a week and it last over one year.

This is the best buy ladies! I always felt like I had 'Witchy-Poo' hair since I was a adolescent. I hid it, straightened it, put it up, and hair-sprayed it. Nothing really worked for me. I was embarrassed with my curls because I didn't know how to care for them properly. If you were like me, you probably bought the old run-of-the-mill products you can purchase anywhere. You also probably shampooed your hair every time you showered, with a lathering shampoo. You might have even towel dried your hair. That's hoe I was taught to care for my curly hair. My mom had straight hair and couldn't help me with my problem. I didn't know I was using the wrong products and doing all the wrong things. This line of products have changed my life! I proudly show off my curls now, and I don't hide them anymore. I learned so much about how to properly care for my hair and that there are different curl types! You can learn yours, too. :) These products are your starting point. They are creamy, and leave your hair feeling soft, not weighted down. Try these as soon as you can!
"
"
Package arrived with a defective pump that had leaked product inside of the packaging. We decided to keep as my wife was desperate to keep using from a previous supply. I hope the situation gets fixed for future or will have to order from another source.Purchased this for my wife after she won a gift basket with the brand as the theme. The product itself is bar none the best ""Shampoo"" & Conditioner ever used. Hair is soft, strong, full of bounce and maintains the hairs natural color and shape. We have used Paul Mitchell and other moderately price brands, this is the one to stick with. Give 4 stars for the whole thing. Minus 1 star for packaging.

Not all curly hair is created equal.  Many of the reviews on here are from people with thick coarse hair who need moisture for their curls and have found love with Devo Curl.  I have naturally curly hair, but it is quite fine and thin.  I love the curl and always wear it curly because it gives my hair body, which it badly needs.  So, let me preface this by saying I do just fine with normal shampoo and conditioner and daily washings.  My main complaint with my hair that I am looking to alleviate is greasiness.  My hair cannot go longer than 24 hours between washes without looking greasy.  I have tried a couple of times to train it to be washed less frequently, but I just couldn't do it.  My scalp just produces too much oil, and if my hair is ""trainable"" then it is going to take too long of a time commitment while suffering horridly greasy hair for me to weather it.  So, I was hoping this product was a stepped down solution from washing my hair with regular cheap shampoos every day.  I've been using Devo Curl for several days now, and am pleased with the results.  My hair looks nice and clean after washing it as directed.  The sudsless nature of it doesn't bother me, as it was expected by the product directions.  I note that by the end of the 24 hours between washings, it looks a bit more greasy than it does with normal shampoo, but I shower in the mornings in order to activate my curls every day, so that is not a deal breaker, and with longer use, it may even get better (if so I will update this review).  One additional mention:  I dislike the smell of 95% of hair and skin products that I have tried.  I don't want to smell fruity or perfume-y, or really anything at all most times.  The smell of this is heavenly.  It smells like a high end salon, but not in an overly chemically way.  You may not like it, plenty of reviews on here complain of the smell.  But I love it.
"
"
love this shampoo & conditioner!  I have been using it for 10+ years when a coworker turned me onto it....  I love that this is not highly scented like many other hair product but be warned some of the Deva Curl newer lines are super STINKY!!!  I had to give away the ultra moisturizing one because I couldnt bare the smell!!!The OG Dev Curl line is gentle on the hair and keeps your curls intact and the frizz away! Also it doesnt strip your hair ... so gentle!
"
"
my hair is at best ""wavy"" so i hesitated. No joke this product changed my LIFE.  my baby fine white chick hair matts into dredlock s (only less controlled, like one big one at my neck) at the slightest provocation... normally.after using this product  my hair can be brushed out in minutes.  my husband who hates spending money on shampoo, changed his tune and now insists i buy more...seriously.note: use SPARINGLY. the bottles last a lot longer than similar cheap shampoo and conditioner. you shoul only use a little bit compared to other  products
"
"
Exactly what I was looking for at a great price! Deva Curl is perfect for my curly, color-treated hair. I shampoo and condition every other day. Deva Curl is gentle and light enough that Day 2 hair is just as great as (if not better than) Day 1! I also use a little One Conditioner as a leave-in after regular conditioning, rinsing, and wringing. Then, I scrunch-dry my hair upside-down with a cotton t-shirt. The smell of both products is herbal and heavenly while in the shower, but subtle after. I love having the large bottles so I can refill my small bottles. The shipping of this set was even quicker than originally estimated. I am very happy with my purchase, and I'll be back for more when my bottles run out. If you're a curly-haired person like me who wants to avoid damaging sulfates, try Deva Curl. Your curls will thank you. And if you're already a Deva Curl devotee, you can order here with confidence. What a great value!
"
"
I love this stuff.  I was skeptical at first and have to admit that the shampoo is something you have to get used to since it doesn't really lather.  It has made a huge difference in my hair though.  I have also found that I don't have to shampoo my hair as often any more.  Without this product my hair would be so greasy the next day that I'd have to wash it every day.  Not the case anymore.  Now if I want I can go every other day (without using dry shampoo).  I am hooked and it is much cheaper on Amazon.  I was fearful that I would get some fake stuff but it was the real deal.  (I had a sample pack purchase from a salon to compare it to).  It has a light scent and makes my hair very soft.  I also use the curl gel and it works.  My hair is really curly (wavy).
"
"
The only shampoo and conditioner I use! The smell is wonderful, it gently cleans my curly hair and leaves it soft and manageable. Yes it's expensive, but I find that most people use WAY TOO MUCH of it! For example, you only need a few pumps in your hand of the No-Poo, and you only use it against your scalp. You don't need to use it on the ends of your hair. When you rinse and it drips down your ends it cleans as it goes. I recommend buying the curly girl hair booklet for great tips.
"
"
If you have thoroughly stripped your hair of residue from using traditional shampoos you simply cannot go wrong with this duo.  If you have been using a traditional type of shampoo (foam with sulfides) all this shampoo is going to do is gum up your hair.Start with the Deva no poo, not Deva CARE no poo.  The Deva no poo will still gum up your hair the first few washings; ie set aside time to wash your hair a good 3 - 5 times the first time using the no poo.  Also be prepared to think you have ruined your hair and for the ammonia smell of the sulfides rinsing out, but rest assured you are on your way.Use a full 32 oz bottle of the regular Deva no poo before switching to the Care then use the regular no poo once a week to cut any additional styling product residue.  In retrospect it would have been fine to use the Care conditioner from the start, but the conditioner is really a personal choice.
"
"
The products came as described and arrived quickly. I bought these to refill the smaller bottles I purchased when I first began using these products.I've been use the DevaCurl system for over a year now and love the way my hair looks and feels. My hair is healthier, softer, and has great shine. I use these as part of the DevaCurl 3 step system.Step 1. Rinse with the NoPoo Cleanser. Step 2. Add conditioner, enough that hair feels very soft. Comb through with fingers and DO NOT wash away all of the conditioner. I usually leave about 50% of it. Step 3. While in shower and hair is soaking wet add desired amount of gel to palm. Run through hair with your fingers and scrunch up the hair to remove excess water.  Let hair air dry or use with diffuser.I only wash with the cleanser every 3 days. On the other days I get my hair wet and add a small amount of conditioner. My hair dresser also suggested that I fill a spray bottle with water and the conditioner and use that on days when I don't want to get my hair soaking wet.
"
"
The packaging was good and the products looked perfect. I've used this product before, purchasing smaller sizes from Target and other carriers. However, I'd only used the ultra conditioning conditioner, which I liked, but this one works great too. I think it still conditions my hair well and the smell is different from what I'm used to but pleasant. For me, this brand really brings some needed moisture and definition to my curls. I'm also happy with this price since at Sephora or Ulta, this duo, would have cost me $88.
"
"
Hands down the Deva Curl products are my favorite out of all the curly hair products I have ever tried! They smell great, work great and are easy to use (big seller for me). I would definitely recommend that if you have curly hair that you use this with the shampoo, conditioner and then the gel to follow the process up. I would also recommend that you go to a deva cut stylist or watch videos online about how to use the system, it will make the deva curl products that much better. Love your curls.
"
"
I never know what to do with my thick curls. I'd been brushing it back into a ponytail and lost some of the elasticity of my curls in the front. I have only used this duo once so far, but already I can see the difference. My curls are tighter and more defined. The only thing I don't like is that, compared to other cleansers I've used, these seemed to make my curls smaller somehow - fuller, smaller curls instead of the almost ringlets I have had in the past. But that may be my own fault for stretching them. I'll update after some actual usage of the product. For now, four stars and definitely recommend.

I have naturally curly hair and have searched for many years for the right products; some were made my hair stiff, some dryed it out, some didn't help with frizz, some made my hair flakey, some itchy...... this product is great! After carefully researching I found it reassuring to know that the lady, Lorraine Massey, who invented this line of products ACTUALLY HAS NATURALLY CURLY HAIR HERSELF!!! I purchased the deva curl gel, deva curl no poo, deva curl conditioner, and curly girl book - my experience with all of them together is fantastic! I am not kidding...ONE wash and gel using the method detailed for my hair in the book and it was a night and day difference!!! ONE wash and people I see every day were commenting on how great my hair looked literally overnight!! I only wish I could get to the Devachan salon to have a cut done by someone who actually knows how to cut curly hair!!Hats off to the Deva Girls from all of us curly girls!!! :)
"
"
Love, love, LOVE the Deva Curl No Poo shampoo and One Condition condition!  They've made such a difference in bringing my curls to life and helping tame the frizzy component of being a Curly Girl.  I also like that Amazon sells these in the 32 oz size so they last a long time and tend to save a little bit of money on a not-so-inexpensive product line.  I also get the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel to finish off my style after using these products.If you're leery of spending the money on a product you've never tried, do what I did and start with the travel pack - but I promise you'll be hooked after the first wash.  Oh, and get the Curly Girl book while you're at it to learn how to take care of your curls - especially using these products.  In the book they teach you things like how you should dry your hair with an old t-shirt rather than a terry cloth towel so the towel doesn't absorb too much moisture from your hair.
"
"
This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. It's not just great for curly hair so don't skip on this product just because ""curl"" is in the name.After shampooing and conditioning, my hair is soft and easy to work with. You don't need to use a lot of product either, so it lasts long.When I received the product, the pumps did not work. However, the company I purchased from replaced the products immediately and they even checked to see if the pumps worked properly before sending them to me. Great customer service and great product.

I have been a devoted Curly Girl since at least 2006 and have preferred to use DevaCare products because of the extra richness and smell of that formula even though my hair isn't color treated. I usually buy the 32oz pair but found it missing from search results this time. Since this product listed both DevaCare No Poo and One Condition in the item details, and since users reported and pictured receiving DevaCare products instead of the DevaCurl, I decided to go ahead and buy, crossing my fingers that it would be the right one. The products I received were the ones in the current picture, the DevaCurl version of both products with new green labels and pumps(the pumps are nice). I removed one star from my rating ONLY because there seems to be a serious discrepancy between the product title and image, the product description, and what product people are receiving. I wish the DevaCare 32oz pair were still available, and if sellers still have inventory of it, there should be a way to select that line of products either within this listing or an entirely different one. I would probably not have bought this listing if i knew for certain it was the DevaCurl, but I will be keeping them unless I can get an exchange for DevaCare. They are without question the best products I've found for my naturally curly hair, bar none, and I can't sing their praises enough, I just like the DevaCare line much better. I also highly recommend all of Lorraine Massey's other products, including Arc AnGel, Set It Free, and the DevaFuser! I mainly wanted to review to let prospective buyers what to expect in the box.

This one has a strong chemical smell and made my hair very dry and it straights my natural curls. I wanted to use the product for a month to see the results but my hair looks sad, dry and with more frizzed hair than ever and barely any curls even before I washed with normal shampoo. I'm sad I wasted all this money.
"
"
I purchased this because I was told it was more moisterizing than the regular combo of the DevaCurl line.  I wish I could get my money back because my hair hates this stuff but loves the one with the green label.  Now I'm forced to use it up because it's so expensive :(I think I'll stick with the cheaper (but effective) SheaMoisture line of products which tend to fit my budget and if I find one of those products don't work I don't feel so bad since I didn't pay a lot of $$$$.My advice, stay away from this product if you hair needs LOTS of moisture like mine.  I have naturally curly African American hair and find this line to be drying for my curls.

I ordered this product, feeling a little concerned about some of the other reviews stating that it had been watered down. I found the exact opposite. It was incredibly thick and makes my hair feel great. The distributor, Beauty Pieces (BP), accidentally sent us two Conditioners instead of one of each. We contacted them and they apologized and told us they would send us the No Poo Shampoo immediately. It came just a couple of days later and they sent an envelope to return the extra conditioner along with postage. I brought the package to the Post Office and it was promptly returned the following day by a not-so-pleasant postal worker telling me that it was short $2.50 for postage. We contacted BP to let them know and they apologized for the inconvenience and told us to keep the Conditioner for our hassle. I not only recommend this product because I have found it to be wonderful and to smell great but also this company has wonderful customer service!

I love this brand! It's pricey but my scalp and hair love it. And my scalp is sensitive. I get reactions to most products that are painful but not this!I uploaded side views of 3rd day hair. I can't be happier with this product line.
"
"
I unfortunately had to return this product. I don't know if it's me, the chemical used in it or maybe I received a bad batch, but my scalp was SOOOO itchy from this. I washed my hair really well and I felt like I couldn't wash out this shampoo or conditioner out. My hair became kind of matted and yet super poofy and I just didn't know what to do. I have super curly brown hair with tight curls and a ton of frizz by the scalp so I was SO hoping to alleviate that, but I guess this wouldn't be ""it"" for me. I'll keep searching.
"
"
It smells like someone mixed old lady perfume with Elmer's glue. Both the products stink- literally. It also didn't make my hair any better than my far cheaper, organic shampoo and conditioner (by Jason). Even if it were good, the smell alone was nauseating. I returned it.

After reading extensive reviews for DevaCurl all over the internet, I believe it is just hype. This shampoo and conditioner perform worse than anything I’ve ever used. Worse than Wal-Mart branded $2.00 soap. Now, I know this is a “no-poo” regimen, and you have to wait to see the results...well I used the routine for 30 days and didn’t see a dang difference. It actually made my hair worse. Don’t reccomend to anyone.
"
"
The no-poo cleanser and conditioner combo bring out my curls and help them stay moisturized, but frizz-free. I use the light spray gel by DevaCurl along with these products. However, the packaging is not as pictured. Both the conditioner and shampoo come in bottles with a pump on top, like a soap dispenser. This would have been fine, but I have ordered this product twice and BOTH times, I have received a no-poo bottle with a faulty top. The dispenser is useless and I need to turn over the very large 32oz bottle of no-poo in order to get the product out.
"
"
I can FINALLY enjoy my curls!!! My hair is so healthy and grows like crazy. Not only does Deva Curl help bring out my curls but it doesn't dry it out. Natural oils are not all washed out which also helps too😍😍😍 pricey but worth it. And I don't need to wash my hair as much. Which also makes the product last longer too.the mirror selfie was taken before I started using Deva and the front camera selfie is what my hair is like now even though it's wet💁🏽
"
"
I love deva curl!! I have curly hair that tends to become dry. I can use the conditioner on the second or third day mixing it with water on my hands and running gently through my hair. The scent of devs is wonderful and my hair is not only clean but soft and condition ed enough I don't have frizz. I love this product!
"
"
I was happy to see that I could get a 32 oz duo for this price.  I was paying close to $40 for a duo that was only 12 oz each.  The pump features is great.  Product is also excellent as always.  This is going to be a reorder every time I run out, which will not be for a while with the size of these bottles :)
"
"
Love this! I normally hate how my hair feels the day after I shower-- dry crunchy and dead. DevaCurl is the first product that doesn't dry out my hair and leaves it shiny. I got a lot of compliments for my curls, and the time it takes to straighten my hair was shorter. Love love love!
"
"
I am a DevaCurl fanatic and you could imagine my disappointment when I received counterfeit product. Do yourself a favor, and buy directly from a salon or deva's website, which only charges $1 for shipping.
"
"
It is not the real product. My wife typically buys this product at the hair salon, at hair salon prices. She thought: ""it would be great to save a little money not having to pay full retail"". She knew the first time she used it, this wan't the same product she was used to. You get what you pay for, this is a knock-off. It's okay as far as regular shampoo and conditioner goes, but it is clearly not the high quality product had salons sell. And it's a lot more expensive than supermarket products, which this clearly is.
"
"
For years I have fought my natural wavy/curly hair. The Devacurl line has changed my life.The No-Poo and Conditioner work wonders! I checked the ingredients on the bottle and this is exactly what I got from Ulta, just much cheaper. I did have some leak out of the bottle during travel, but nothing major lost.Great product, good deal. Arrived on time. Will buy again!
"
"
I really love Deva curl products the only drawback is they are so expensive and my hair is so thick. I go through them too quickly for the cost so I can only justify spending this kind of money on the shampoo and conditioner.Definitely worth it for these two products though.  I had issues with itchy scalp and when I use this shampoo it totally solves the problem.
"
"
Product recieved on time although the pump to the conditioner was damaged in either packaging or delivery. I dont know. I contacted the seller through Amazon on the same day of receipt 12/24 and as of today still no response. So..1) Yes on product.  2)No on seller.The product does what its supposed to do. It eleminates frizz while returning moisture to the hair making curls more defined, bouncy and no longer dry.  Both the shampoo and conditioner are creamy and  Easy to apply. It smells great. If you have extreme texture to your curls and need to return it moisture this is what you want.  Déva Curl will define the strand. Great Product.

I have extremely thick, course, long, wavy hair.  I have Carrie Bradshaw hair but frizzier, thicker, and... you get the idea.  I use the No Poo after my long run of the week (I run over 20 miles per week so I get some serious sweat in my hair) and it cleanses and is a pleasing smell.  It does not tangle during shampooing and only around a tablespoon to two tablespoons is needed to clean my hair on my one wash day of the week.  It rinses cleanly and gives hair that slippery feeling.  The conditioner feels a bit watery - compared to deep conditioners I have used in the past.  But with a wide tooth comb, I do not rip or break my hair and it easily slips through in the shower.  I wet my hair on non-wash days and only condition and my hair is clean, smells fresh, and healthy.  After trying every curly hair on the market, this is such a simple solution.  I do use the gel and nothing else with perfect results every time.  I could get away with a 12 oz bottle of no poo, and 32 oz of conditioner and gel since i use the no poo the least.  For the price, you cannot find a better system for wavy hair.
"

I have fairly coarse 3C hair and it did a good job at helping me maintain my curl pattern. High quality, but I’m not sure if it is worth the price considering there are equable quality products that are half the price.
"
"
This is NOT the real Devacurl product and is damaging to your hair!!!! You're much safer and better off ordering direct from their website or on Sephora or Ulta Beauty.
"
"
This stuff is amazing.  I used to straightened my hair everyday because I couldn't control the frizz.  Now, I let it be curly and it is never frizzy.  I have used so many products in the past it's ridiculous.  This is the best!!  Curly Girl: The Handbook by Michelle Bender, who recommends and/or created this product is an absolute must.  She has and knows how to work with curly hair.  My hair is thick and course with S curls.  AND...I found a stylist that knows how to cut curly hair...what a difference!  That was a another recommendation from the book.  I now love my curly hair!!!
"
"
I have been using Devachan products for at least a dozen years and I have my favorites and not so favorites.  Although I have tried several of their products, these two are by far my favorites.  I have tried other shampoos and conditioners but I always come back to Devachan.  The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair smelling fresh and clean without over stripping.  The only downside of the Devachan line is that it is pricey but I bought the duo at an excellent price.
"
"
Two big bottles that arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner.  I never tried it before.  I have only used the No-Poo and Conditioner once as I write this.  The aroma is pleasant but a little weird.  I liked using the No-Poo, it felt creamy and silky, and a bit tingly.  It seemed to clean my hair well, and left it detangled and smooth.  I followed up with the conditioner, and my hair is still air-drying right now.  Wish me luck, I am hoping to tame my frizzy curls.
"
"
I know that there are a lot of bad reviews, but i love this product. First this product it's amazing my hair loves it!! I have highlights and my hair would not hold the curl and it was always frizzy. This product gave life back to my hair!! And the smell is lovely, yes at the beginning it might be a little overwhelming but you get used to it quickly. To me it smells like clean laundry and  orange blossoms. I bought it from beauty in style and the product that i received was totally legit! Now you have to remember that its a no poo so it will not lather, you don't need to use a lot of product otherwise you can start getting oily hair and buildup. I also bought the low poo from deva curl and i plan to use it once a week to eliminate the buildup. And you can always get the trial packet to see if you like it
"
"
DevaCurl products are just the best for curly hair! My hair is also dyed so I use the DevaCare line. My color lasts longer, and my curls look better, than with any other products. If you're new to DevaCurl definitely check out the tips on the website on how to use them for best effect (even if you think you already know how to wash and condition your hair, they're helpful!). The bottle openings do tend to get clogged after a few uses, but rather than get pumps for them I just screw the caps off and pour it out that way. Highly recommended!
"
"
As of November I'll have been using these products for a year...the difference I've noticed in the health of my hair is AWESOME, I will never go back to other products.  After I got past the first month of using this system (your hair might go through a transition period as it adjusts to this new formula you're introducing which has none of the chemicals it's used to if you've been using products with parabens and sulfates etc...) but definitely don't stop using it! Your hair and scalp will adjust and your hair will get stronger, shinier, healthier! LOOOOVE THIS!
"
"
I walked around work all day yesterday smelling my hair!! It smelled so good!!! It was so shiny and moisturized. I don't ever want to be without it!
"
"
What I don't like is it is hard to get used to the no sudsing thing, but it is sooo good for your hair.  I honesty haven't used for some time and I'm now back with a much stronger commitment!!!!
"
"
I love this stuff!  I have untamable curly hair. This product does not dry it out and smells great. I have been using those product for about 8 months now.  Amazon has the best price on it as well.
"
"
OUTSTANDING PRODUCT AND PRICE!!!! Salon's usually sell for $33 per bottle. This was perfect, one No Poo and One Condition. If you haven't tried a zero lather shampoo, this is the one to try. It is different at first since no lather but after reading what's in lathering shampoos and what's NOT in this, I'll never go back. I've used it for years and my hair color never fades with this product.
"
"
I am just starting my journey of no more shampoo. So far, so good. I love the way this no-poo smells and this combo leaves my hair soft and conditioned. I am so grateful to finally find a system where I don't have to fight my curly hair so much and leaves my hair conditioned, clean, and manageable without sulfates, parabens, or silicones. I love this set!
"
"
This just might be the best shampoo and conditioner you'll ever use! The last six inches of my hair resembled Shredded Wheat until using this product. The shampoo cleans well while keeping my hair soft. The conditioner gives the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down or making it feel waxy. I have wurly (wavy/curly) hair that's colored and tends to be very dry, especially at the ends. This duo lends moisture while helping my color last much longer than usual. I noticed the difference after the very first use and the results are getting better with each wash. If your hair is extra-dry, I recommend washing, conditioning as usual, and then adding a small (dime-sized) amount to the ends of your towel-dried hair. Your hair will be soft and shiny beyond belief. Oh, and these bottles have pumps on them too, which is convenient. Get this stuff! You won't regret it!
"
"
This stuff is amazing.  At first it took a little time to get used to it not foaming up, but my hair has never been better.  I have curly hair, but it is also very fine and not super thick (normal to thin).  This cleans without stripping out too much of the natural moisture.  I have always had hair that gets oily after about a day, and since I have been using this, I can go longer between washes.  I think it is due to the fact that it doesn't strip out all the moisture and force my skin into over producing oil.
"
"
I am OBSESSED with this shampoo. I have never been the kind of person who spent a lot of money on hair products... and buying Dove shampoo felt like a splurge because honestly.. soap is soap right?? I can't believe what a difference this shampoo makes on my hair. It's fuller, curlier and softer than ever! The non-lathering shampoo is definitely something to get used to but it definitely works! I would recommend this product to anyone with a slight curl in their hair. I have wavy hair, definitely not ringlets but this shampoo has made a few ringlets appear and it's wonderful!
"
"
I first tried the curl kind kit.  I tried so many different products in my natural hair and this works the best.  Great pricing here on Amazon for the duo.  Follow up with styling cream then use a microfiber towel to get the excess water out. Also key tip buy a diffuser! Dries and holds your curls!
"
"
I've tried this shampoo/conditioner duo for a few months and I'm disappointed with the results because the shampoo caused me to develop dandruff. I didn't change anything else in my daily hair routine and when I stopped using the shampoo regularly the dandruff problem went away. For reference, I rarely apply any heat to my hair, I use warm (not hot) water on my scalp, I shampoo every day or every other day, I deep condition, and I don't apply any other product to my roots/scalp.
"
"
I have tried to get this to work for a couple months now. No matter what I do it leaves my hair feeling greasy on the underneath layers. I don't even have super oily hair. I have tried less amount of shampoo/conditioner, washing the product out for 10 minutes, etc. For me, this does not work and was a waste of my money. I honestly wish I could just send the bottles back and get a refund.
"
"
Got this for a friend of mine who has beautiful curly hair. HE has never used anything but the 2 in1 men hair products and after using this for a week he saw a huge difference. He loves how ""cool, shiny and bouncy"" his curls have gotten. Also got him the DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel to go with it. That definitely helps keep the curls all day.
"
"
My daughter has curly hair and loves this stuff.  A little goes a long way and I buy this once a year
"
"
Happy to find these for a great price and Prime shipping. My curly hair seems to really be improving with use over the last six months. Also have a bottle of Low-Poo Shampoo for the days when I just really want to degrease.
"
"
I really wanted to like it. I watched all the YouTube how-to videos and gave it a solid three months. Even when I use plenty of shampoo and conditioner, my hair still ends up feeling greasy after just a few hours. Great smell, good packaging, poor results.
"
"
This is a great product. It does not help with build up but if you use it 3 times a week, it makes your hair very soft.
"
"
I have shoulder length thick wavy hair that is colored.  The DevaCurl keeps everything under control.  It took a few times to get used to the shampoo not lathering, but it really moisturizes my hair.  I sometimes use a pomade on my hair to style it and the No-Poo cleanser gets it all out.  The only reason I don't give this five stars is because most of the time, the pump doesn't work.  If you order the big bottles, save any pump that works.  You'll need it.
"
"
I originally purchased my first set at the Salon and I loved it! Then I bought my second set on Amazon and it was fine. Recently I ordered it again and it smells yucky. After reading the reviews I see it is not the real product. I'll be going back to the salon for my future purchases.
"
"
I was recommended this product by a friend and a stylist. Unfortunately the cut the stylist gave me, a ""DevaCut"", was awful BUT I love the product she used. It smells nice and I've been looking for a shampoo that doesn't have any sulfates in it. The shampoo doesn't get sudsy or lather AT ALL. which is great for me because sulfates in regular shampoos were destroying my scalp, especially in the winter. The conditioner is also great, you can put it in your hair during your shower and rinse it out just a little and leave some conditioner in (like a leave-in) and style as usual. This is supposed to hydrate your hair more than rinsing it all out - not sure if that actually happens but at least there's no sticky residue after drying when I leave some in. This is intended for curly-wavy hair, but can be used on any type of hair since all it really does is add moisture.
"
"
I like the conditioner, but I don’t care for the smell that comes from the shampoo. It smells like I just got an old style permanent. Sorry to report, because I really like diva products.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair, and I have tried so many different products over the years. Yet, I always find myself coming back to DevaCurl. The shampoo is sulfate free so that takes a little getting used to (or at least for me it did). But I love that after a few weeks of use, I am able to use little to no anti-frizz product. My hair always looks and feels healthy, and the product is concentrated so these bottles last a long time (and that's with an almost daily wash).
"
"
I purchased this in September.  I had previously bought it at a hair salon and at ULTA.  This time it made my hair frizzy and dry.  I just figured that it didn't work for me anymore and started trying new products.  I tried it again today and suddenly realized that it didn't have any scent and neither did the shampoo.  I had a travel size kit that I had purchased at ULTA and never used, so I went and got it and smelled it.  Sure enough, it had that wonderful scent that the real Decadence has.  I smelled them side by side.  What a difference!  Next I compared the consistancy.  I put a little of the travel size product on my forefinger and moistened it under the faucet.  Some conditioner stayed on my finger.  I tried the same thing with the product that I purchased here and the conditioner all washed off!!  No wonder why my hair is so dry!!  This is not authentic Deva Curl Decadence.  I have been scammed!  Going to give it another chance and purchase straight from Deva Curl or from ULTA.
"
"
I ordered this product last month, it did not do the same thing to my hair that Deva Curl Decadence usually does to my hair. Today I went to ULTA and bought a bottle of the real stuff and sure enough, they smell COMPLETELY different and feel COMPLETELY different. This is not the real deal, this should not be sold at all on Amazon.
"
"
Even though this product smells exactly like devacurl products, I believe it is not the real thing or maybe it is a mixture of devacurl and other fillers. I went on a trip, and I purchased the travel sized devacurl from an actual salon. Once I returned, I started using this product from amazon, and I noticed that the texture of this product versus the real devacurl product from the actual devacurl store was COMPLETELY different. This product was a lot thicker and denser. However, i continued using it thinking that maybe I was imagining things. A week after using it, I noticed that my scalp had become very itchy, and this product leaves buildup unlike the real devacurl products. It also does not dissolve in water as I tried to put it in a spray bottle for refreshing my curls, and it did not dissolve at all.Moral of the story... don't be cheap, and pay for the real thing! #moneywasted

I’m of mixed race with super fine and frizzy tiny curls. I’m 50 years old and have been a product junky for most of my life, with mixed success. But I always wanted my hair to swing, and to hold it’s all-over curl, like it does when wet or freshly washed. I discovered DevaCurl 1 year ago by asking a black customer of mine what she used in her lovely curls. My hair is now perfect every day, even when I wake. When I get a haircut, I no longer need drastic damage cuts, and so my hair is the longest it’s been. The secret is to follow Deva Curls instruction book. 1. No other non-Deva products (this is non-silicone, non oil, so hydration can soak in). 2. Filter on shower head ($25 or so at home improvement stores, easy to self-install). 3. Use a satin pillowcase or head covering at night to stop friction (graceeleyae.com products recommended). 4. I only use 3 DevaCurl products. No-poo, Decadence Conditioner and Arc Gel. According to my hairdresser, I don’t need any of the deep conditioner. After washing and combing, re-wet hair, carefully squeeze out excess water, and soak strands thoroughly with conditioner, DevaCurl says until strands feel like seaweed. Use a microfiber towel or tee shirt to carefully squeeze out excess water. Put copious amounts of gel in. Hair will still be soft, nongreasy, and even comb-able (when wet), in future. 5. Wash hair as little as is necessary. I wash weekly. 6. For daily maintenance, I stand outside of shower, and moisten my hair in the running warm water. Re-squeeze with microfiber towel, finger comb if necessary and reapply more conditioner and gel. First time in my life that strangers stop me in the street daily to complement my hair! Products not cheap, but I’m no longer throwing away unworkable products or paying for Brazilian Blowouts, or relaxers, etc. I wasn’t paid in anyway for this recommendation.

I think it's fake.  I can't prove it, but my hair looked like s**t the entire time I used this. When I went back to using the bottle I bought from my salon my hair went back.
"
"
I love this stuff! I've been using Deva Curl for almost 2 years now and I have not loved a conditioner as much as I love this one. If you're thinking of trying out Deva Curl, or if you haven't used Decadence yet, give it a try. This stuff is heaven! I've heard stories about people getting watered down bottles (and this actually happened to me with conditioner once - different seller) but I am completely pleased with this purchase. If the price is scaring you off, one of the large bottles lasts me over 6 months because I only need to use it once or twice a week. I have very thick and long hair that is, or rather was, very prone to getting greasy. Now that I'm using this product line it takes days for my hair to start looking and feeling like it needs a wash, After a few weeks of using Deva Curl I can honestly say that my hair has never been happier!
"
"
Best conditioner I have ever used. I will continue to buy again, and again, and again. I found there to be a substantial difference between the DevaCurl One and the DeveCurl One Decadence. The Decadence is more hydrating and smells better too!
"
"
This is generally a great product - it nourishes and detangles hair leaving them healthy and shiny. However, the most recent purchase I made on Amazon was clearly a fake - it was very watery, required significant larger amounts for every use and still was barely doing anything for my hair. Check out the seller you are buying from before you make the purchase!
"
"
Best Conditioner I've found for under $40. It's great. I use it as a prewash, a conditioner, and also a leave in. It has great slip, but also a decent hold. I have thick curly curly hair. I do not own a diffuser but it does work better if you dry your hair a bit instead of leaving it soaking wet. why 4 stars? I do love it, but I don't LOVE the smell I only like the smell of the product.
"
"
This Devacurl One Condition Decadence is a knock off! I was wondering why my my hair wasn't moisturized and dry and brittle.  I went to Ulta Cosmetics where I normally go to buy the Devacurl One Condition Decadence and my hair is moisturized soft and manageable. I will be returning this product.

This Devacurl One Condition Decadence is a knock off! I was wondering why my my hair wasn't moisturized and dry and brittle.  I went to Ulta Cosmetics where I normally go to buy the Devacurl One Condition Decadence and my hair is moisturized soft and manageable. I will be returning this product.
"
"
Ive been using Deva products exclusively for 3 years. This is NOT Deva conditioner. It is far too thin and smells horrible. The smell is like old play doh. Not only that hit doesn't condition KY hair nearly as well. Super disappointed since this is the first time I've been burned on Amazon by a knock off product. Won't make this mistake again, I'll spend the extra money and buy my conditioner from a beauty supply store from now on.
"
"
This is not the legit DevaCurl Decadence conditioner. Im not sure if it is extremely watered down or just a completely different conditioner, but it smells and feels nothing like the actual thing. It made my hair feel extremely dry while still in the shower and made it impossible to detangle. No slip at all like the real thing.
"
"
The perfect prescription for my overly dry curls. When used right this will make your curls silky smooth and soft. Leave most of it in your hair! Use a small amount of ultra defining gel, get the right deva cut. Totally life changing! Curls are awesome!!!This conditioner becomes heavy in the curls after they are hydrated or in humid climates... may want to start with a smaller bottle to make sure it is what you want.
"
"
Upgraded to decadence after using the original for years and I am amazed.  After the first use my curls improved ten fold to the point where people noticed. The scent is so much more pleasant my husband can't get enough of it!It's also light enough to be used as a leave in which can be a must in the dry cold winters a mile above sea level. If I need a boost and something thicker I will use Heaven In Hair from the original line.I'll never use anything else on a daily basis again. Can't go wrong with this one if your a Curly Girl!
"
"
I've tried so many conditioning products for my wavy/curly hair and they either flatten the curl or leave my hair looking like a frizz ball. DevaCurl products have saved my hair. I use the decadence line, since it's more moisturizing to my color processed hair, but the no-poo and low-poo are great as well. If you're just switching over to non-sulphate shampoo and condition, it'll take a bit of getting used to the feel. Trust. It IS cleaning your hair, it IS rinsing out, and it's NOT going to leave an excess film (it's just the way it feels, and it leaves your curls protected and luscious). With regular use (and if you don't alternate with sulphate shampoos) you are going to see a major difference. I was never able to comb through my long, curly hair in the shower without a lot of stress, trying to get the conditioner through while working out all the tangles. With this stuff, no tangles. And hair is healthier than it's ever been.
"
"
Maybe it was an erroneous purchase on my part, but for context: I have 3a type curls that tend to get moderately dry in the winter. The regular DevaCurl One Conditioner wasn't cutting it so I thought I'd try this. It made my hair way too soft and weighed down.I did manage to find a happy medium: I use the regular DevaCurl One Conditioner and, after my shower, I spray It's a 10 Miracle Leave in Product on my curls before applying my gel.
"
"
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  I am 3A in curls, with very fine hair.  This does NOT weigh down the curls at all.  It may seem drying at first, because I use a ton of conditioner everyday, but this is the perfect amount, once you get used to it.  I use the Coconut styling cream after using this product, and my curls are nice and bouncy, without being crunchy or frizzy.
"
"
This conditioner is so wonderful. I will definitely keep a bottle on hand at all times. I have curly hair and I normally use a cleansing conditioner but I don't want to use it every day or multiple times a week. After I wash my hair if I want to wear it curly several days in a row by day 3 it is starting to get a little dry despite the styling creams I put in it. So I like to use this on day 3 or 4 to re-moisturize my hair. When I condition my hair before doing the wash and go I always have several people complimenting my curls and asking what I use in my hair.  I also use a small amount sometimes as a leave in conditioner if I am wearing my hair in a bun. It smells good to me. I have no complaints. It came quickly. Was packaged appropriately. None had leaked out during transport. Very happy with my purchase.
"
"
Best product for curly hair! I started with curl deva nearly two years magi and haven't use md any other product. The decadence gives a little more moisture without the heaviness of other products.
"
"
I’ve used this product for years. There’s no way they did not change the formula. In recent months, I noticed a change in the look and feel of the product. I didn’t think anything of it. However, I wish I had. Deva curl products have ruined my hair. It’s as if they put relaxing chemicals in their products. Some strands of my very curly hair have become completely straight while others have just loosened. It has also changed the texture of my hair. I am mortified. I saw that people were speaking out but didn’t stop using their products because I didn’t see a change in my own hair but I trusted them too much and now my hair is damaged. Even if you haven’t seen a change in your hair, please stop using these products. It’s not worth it to wait and see if it will ruin your hair too.
"
"
Smells like plastic, does nothing fur my hair. I use this conditioner regularly and orderly from amazon all the time, but this time I got a dud.
"
"
Love love love Deva curl decadent conditioner! I use it as a leave in conditioner and mine and my daughter's curls are pop pop popin'!!All I do is wash my hair rub this conditioner all over my wet hair. Scruch my hair with my hands and the curls start to form!! I just let it air dry for about an hour to let the conditioner clear and really set in!!Best wash and go and day to day curls💃
"
"
!!!!!My hair has been falling out (after just one bottle) and matting every single day. It is absolutely horrifying. 4 pics show the gradual damage from color and texture change to severe breakage. All my blood test results came back perfectly normal and there is no other explanation. My hair knots and matts every day and barely curls, the texture of my hair is unrecognisable it feels rough and crunchy. The hair loss is constant and so dramatic. I stopped using DC one year ago now. I had to chop it off. My hair is growing back but my curls and overall fullness are definitely gone. Beware!!
"
"
Love love love this product. My daughter has beyond super dry curly hair.seriously I could put so much conditioner on her hair that it would be dripping product and leave it in there without rinsing it and in 2 hours her hair was dry again and FrIzZeD OUT! I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on all  kinds of product that claim to help, however none truly helped her hair. I put this in her not to much and I run my fingers through her hair (which I now can do) her hair is so soft so healthy and so pretty!! She wakes up now with beautiful locks and not frizzy nest. I have even used it on my hair and it wasn't to greasy. I did purchase the curl gel as well and put just a squirt or two in her hair while it's still wet.
"
"
If I could rate negative stars I would. The item description(which has since changed) was for a 2 pack of 32 oz bottles. I know it’s a great deal so I ordered it, turns out it’s a lie, was a 2 pack of 3 oz bottles which is NOT a good deal.  I email their customer service and the response is simply....the description was wrong, it has been fixed, thank you.  Needless to say I will NEVER shop with them again.
"
"
The price is just too high. I found something I like more than this. Yes to carrots nourishing conditioner. Price is way lower and I like how my hair feels more with it.
"
"
I had tried this conditioner as part of a travel/sample kit a month or so ago. The consistency is a light to medium cream which I was thinking could not possibly do anything for detangling on 4a natural hair.  To my surprise this product has great slip and made my detangle process sooo much easier.  It has a pleasant smell - not too strong and rinses easily. I will purchase this again.
"
"
I've seen in some reviews that this is not an authorized seller of DevaCurl products. Honestly, I can't tell the difference between this and what I've purchased at Ulta.Either way, this product cleanses, moisturizes and has wonderful slip for detangling my 4a/4b coily hair. I don't find the scent unpleasant or overwhelming. This is the best product I've found for gently cleansing my hair.
"
"
I used this product before I got it as a gift From a friend  in a smaller bottle and it was amazing for my hair. This one I ordered from amazon and it’s very different consistency, much thicker and it doesn’t smell the same.I was happy to find a large bottle well priced but I won’t be reordering, It makes my hair heavy and it feels like it’s not rinsed out when it dries. I’ll try to purchase from Ulta or Sephora.
"
"
Devacurl is truly amazing, I’ve been using for 2 months and can see so many positive changes including less frizz, more curl definition. I’ve received a lot of compliments since the change. Curly girl method has truly worked for me & I’m very exciting to continue to see what these products can do long term! For the price, the products actually last a while as well. I have half a bottle left after 2 months
"
"
Was not happy to open my package and find that the bottle spilled everywhere.
"
"
Mine was sold by ""Gold Fulfillment"", who shipped me ""No Poo Decadence"" shampoo instead of conditioner. I didn't notice until after I'd opened it and started using it. I initially thought it was my mistake, but I looked back at the order, and I did indeed order the conditioner. Needless to say, I'm pretty annoyed.
"
"
I’m sensitive to strong, floral or woody scents so this product was too much for me. It wasn’t as moisturizing for my hair type as some of the other brands I’ve tried. It might be great for other hair types though so if you enjoy strong scents, this might be for you
"
"
I recently starting using Deva Curls. Just a few weeks ago I decided to go blonde for the summer. Going blonde= no more curls. Lucky I used the Deva Curls during the process, which lead them to not become damage. So yes I do love this product in every way. I use everything down the their styling products. I totally recommend this to everyone especially my tight curly headed girls!
"
"
I have purchased this more than 3x already, I truly love this conditioner. It leaves my hair so moisturized and soft, with a pleasant smell that reminds me of babies lol. I definitely will keep repurchasing this product. I have coily thirsty curls (3c-4a type) and yes it works for me! I use it as a leave in conditioner and I use lots of it. Plus, it’s waaay cheaper here than in stores, literally half the price.
"
"
Love DevaCurl, so I thought I'd try their Decadence line. I've noticed my hair seems a bit more curly/less frizzy with this stuff vs their regular forumla, but also everyone LOVES the smell of this stuff vs the regular stuff. My husband, strangers, my cat.Great product + great smell = win win
"
"
I use this conditioner plus the shampoo and supercream on my three year old who has super tight ringlet curls. The conditioner leaves her hair nicely moisturized. We’ve been using this for about a year and a half. It’s the best product I’ve found for super curly hair!
"
"
I have ordered this product in the past, but I was exceptionally happy with this most recent purchase due to the packaging. In the past, the bottle has come in a large box and sometimes exploded due to shipping and handling. However, this order was nicely packaged in a fitted box! So bravo to the team that packaged this product!Also, to all my curly friends, this conditioner works wonders for my curls! It leaves your curls feeling moisturized and soft!
"
"
I am in love with this product!!! along with every other devacurl product out there.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling crazy soft, less frizzy, and ready to curl right out of the shower.  At this moment I use this conditioner along with the coconut super cream I do not shampoo, only maybe once a week, but I condition everyday. My very frizzy kinda awkward curls turn into perfect banana curls, when used along with the super cream.  I can 100% tell a difference in the quality of of my hair when I use a devacurl product and when I don't (when I run out  and forget to order :(  ) An added plus is it smells good to!  I deff would recommend this to anyone with curly hair.  Devacurl's products are amazing and I'm so happy someone introduced me to them.
"
"
I leave some of the conditioner in my 3C curls because the cuticle tends to stand up making my hair dry and frizzy. This conditioner is a little lighter, defines and moisturizes very well. It dries a little quicker than some of the thicker conditioners I've used. Smells great! I like DevaCurl but of course not all their products have worked for for my type of hair - I'll be ordering this one again.
"
"
""Decadence"" is my Fall-Winter go to.  It has wonderful moisturizers.  Spring-Summer is back to ""One Condition"" normal, as ""Decadence"" can make your hair too moist in humid conditions.
"
"
Smelled strongly of alcohol and was very thin. Not like the decadence I have used in the past. I think this formula is a fake.
"
"
We are good with the product, works wonders on my daughters very tight naturally curly hair. Smells great and makes her curls soft without frizz. MyProblem was the packaging. It came with a broken nozzle and was leaking conditioner all over the bag. 😑
"
"
Love the product but this is the third or fourth time it has arrived broken! I'm thankful it didn't leak all over this time. I have saved the pump from an old bottle...my saving grace. Will try a different company that cares about packaging...if I remember next order.
"
"
Happy to find this on Amazon. I got more product for my money than buying this at the salon. The pump is the best part!I have curly hair and I am a 3C so this product works perfectly for me. I put some of this product in my water bottle, spritz my hair and then coat with this leave in conditioner. No build up,,,thank goodness! At night I do the same thing and also put in a homemade natural Shea butter mixture. Then do a 2 strand twist. The two go together nicely. My hair is nice and curly and soft in the morning. :)Highly reccomend this product.
"
"
This is my favorite conditioner. There are three curly heads in my family so this stuff goes quick. I use this conditioner for multiple uses like co-wash and leave in. I have 3c hair type for reference.
"
"
Terrible!! Listen to everyone else’s comments and. DO NOT BUYDevaCurl personally reached out to me and told me this product is not theirs and that people are filling these bottles with a super cheap conditioner
"
"
I can’t really smell any scent. Or would be nice if it had one. But then not everyone likes the same scents. Anyway, it’s very moisturizing. Works well in my wavy hair.
"
"
So far the best conditioner I've used for my hair. I used to just buy whatever was cheapest cause I figured soap was soap, but since using it my hair feels noticeably stronger. It doesn't quite have the same sleekness, or shininess of some other stuff I was using, but my hair doesn't frizz as easily the best day.
"
"
I've used this product for a while now and this is definitely not the real stuff. My hair consistently comes out when I run my fingers through it in the shower, when before it would only be a couple strands. Not ordering this one again.
"
"
This is my favorite devacurl products from their line! especially great for 2b / 3c curly hair that tends to dry fast. I like to use this after using olaplex no.3 co wash with my favorite peppermint shampoo.
"
"
Deva Curl has the best products! I usually buy at Ulta but it’s cheaper on here. The cap wasn’t on tight so when I received it it had leaked out some but since it’s tightly wrapped in plastic there was no mess. But to be fair I live in Arizona where in gets hotter that 100 degrees so that could have caused the cap to pop.
"
"
I'm a big fan of the devacurl products but I don't know how I feel about this conditioner it's a little watery but I'm still giving it a chance. I have really thick curly hair and I feel like it's just not as conditioning as I would like it to be.
"
"
My favorite conditioner by far and I’ve tried a lot. Thick 4b-c hair this conditioner moisturizes without feeling greasy or weighed down.
"
"
I bought a few DevaCurl products and so far they are doing wonders for my curls!  No crunchy, nice and soft and flowy!  Love, love, love!  Highly recommend!
"
"
Does not condition well on all hair, pick only if it works for you. I have 2 daughters and myself and it onky really softened one of our hair types
"
"
My hair is thick, wavy and coarse. This product is amazing. It leaves my hair soft and smooth but not so soft that I can’t style it. Can’t recommend it enough!
"
"
My daughter is interracial and loves the way these products work for her hair
"
"
This is not the true DevaCurl One Condition Decadence. It leaves hair knotted and waxy, does not moisturize like real DevaCurl.
"
"
I wanted to love these products. As a matter of fact I did love them but they made my scalp really itchy.
"
"
The packaging was very good! I would be surprised if it was leacking and of course it wasn’t!I was concerned about the smell after reading the comments, BUT I absolutely adore the smell! It doesn’t smell like flowers or berries but it has the smell of freshness and cleanness and I love it! Helps feels refreshed after shower!And the moistorising is just perfect!I had almost fried hair from multiple bleaches the past year and tried a lot of different conditioners, this was the only one that mannaged to leave my hair super soft and untangled!
"
"
I have been using Deva products for about 3-4 years and this is the one product I cannot do without.  I use it alone, or in combination with the supercream for my wavy/curly hair.  Keeps it shiny and manageable.
"
"
The controversy with DevaCurl aside, I had grown tired of their products for a while now. My scalp is itchy, my ends are dry (even after a 4-inch cut), and my roots are extremely weighed down from product build-up. Save your money. There are plenty of other, more affordable products (Shea Moisture, Curlsmith, etc.) that are way better for your hair and do what DevaCurl claims to do.
"
"
MY FAVORITE!! I've never been able to operate on a ""wash & go"" style until I was introduced to Deva. This accompanied with gel and cream makes my life simpler! My hair has also never been healthier. Typically when I've reached this length(down my waist) it's so dry and dead it needs cut off and a fresh start. Not now!
"
"
My curly frizzy hair drinks this stuff up.  No, it won't get rid of the frizz.  Nothing but straightening or glue can do that, but it makes my hair feel soft and smooth after a wash.  And, it's sulfate free so it doesn't impact coloring or keratin treatments!
"
"
If you could see my hair!  I love how moist this conditioner leaves my hair.  Silky, full of body and ready to be played with.
"
"
There have been several reviews that say this product is not an authentic Deva Curl product; however, I compared it directly to product purchased at the same time from Deva Curl and they are the same product. Smell, consistency, and results are the same for both products purchased from Deva Curl and this seller through amazon.
"
"
Only product I ever use in my hair is this with the curling cream. Only issue I have is that the pump won’t work so I have to open up this huge bottle to use it
"
"
I really didn't like this product compared to the original One Conditioner. It doesn't feel like it does any long-term benefits for my hair. It works fine for styling, but the original conditioner would leave my hair silky and smooth when I rinse it out. This one doesn't. It also made my hair poof-ier when I don't use any products after showering.I assume all hair is a little different and this stuff just doesn't work for mine. The original is great though. I shouldn't have messed with a good thing but I figured I'd give this a shot. I just wish I had bought a smaller bottle for my trial.
"
"
This is not real DevaCurl product. The consistency of it is cheap and not moisturizing whatsoever. My hair felt so dry like hay after using this. Go spend your money on the real deal in stores or on their actual website. I spent too much money on what probably turned out to be $2 suave in a DevaCurl bottle.
"
"
My favorite conditioner. I have medium curly hair that I blow out. I wash my hair once a week and this conditioner is super creamy and nourishing. Have been using it for a couple of years.
"
"
If you have super curly hair this is for you. I dye my hair regularly and the conditioner is very gentle on my color while still giving me the moisture my curls need. I use deva curls other products for stylin as well
"
"
Love this conditioner, leaves my hair super soft. I have long thick wavy hair dry hair.  when using Deva Curl decadence I can put it in my hair when my hair is wet and run my fingers right thru it.
"
"
I have 3a curly hair. This stuff feels thick and you need to use a lot to coat your hair. My hair seems a little lifeless after using it. Not worth the money, won't buy again.
"
"
Might be fake, very liquid consistency unlike the previous ones I’ve used, seems watered down. Doesn’t work as well as the previous ones I’ve used.
"
"
Like the smell; like how my hair holds the curl for the day, like the texture of my hair for the day.
"
"
Some days it works great, other days I feel really dry. I think you need to combine with a deep conditioner a few days a week
"
"
Amazing product. Works perfectly for my hair (that is a straight one). Moisturizing is amazing.
"
"
Item arrived plastic sealed, no mess as other reviews showed which I'm happy about. I LOVE this conditioner, it allows me to stop using detangling brushes and combs to get rid of knots, I can just use my fingers to get through my hair! Works really well as a conditioning spray for second day curls :) small amount goes a long way
"
"
So far my favorite conditioner since changing to the MAP hair method from Curly Hair Artistry.  I have very fine hair with 3B type curls and this stuff is great.
"
"
I have coarse curly hair and have been using the original DevaCurl line for a couple of years.  I always felt my hair needed just a bit more conditioning. This new formula does just that. I love it!
"
"
Beware. This product is fake. Compared it with my authentic deva curl products. Doesn’t smell or feel the same.
"
"
Leaves curly hair manageable. Wish it had slightly more slip. Great fragrance. Not floral or citrus. Just subtle.
"
"
Again, even Deva Curl didn’t mess up a conditioner. I use it as a cowash  My less expensive brand works just as well.
"
"
This product has been watered down.  It smells different and the consistency is runny.  Real Deva Decadence is super thick.  Amazon needs to stop selling this fake 3rd party stuff!!
"
"
Versatile as conditioner and as a little leave in moisture for curly hair days
"
"
My hair is nice and soft after but the scent is a little strong.
"
"
I have very curly dry hair and this works great. I use it as a rinse out conditioner when I wash my hair and use it as a co-wash. Very rich and leaves my hair soft.
"
"
This is a fake product. It doesn’t smell like anything and the graphics are counterfeit.
"
"
I have extremely curly hair.  I use the deva curl gel all the time and love it.  I've gotten this conditioner and the shampoo though, and it's alright, but it's not doing anything I can't get done cheaper elsewhere.
"
"
I love this conditioner.  Does not weigh down my hair nor does it have a heavy scent.  I have allergies and for me that last part is huge!
"
"
Wifey bought the shampoo and the  conditioner for our daughter.  Works great.  Nice scent.Use the conditioner as a leave-in conditioner.
"
"
I was nervous buying this online.  I thought it would not be the authentic product and was thrilled that it is.  My daughter has used this product for a while and this was a replacement bottle.  Can't beat the price!
"
"
DevaCurl One Condition is good but I must say I love this One Condition Decadence. It is very moisturizing for my hair and my hair just drinks it up. The 32 oz bottle is great because the 12 oz bottles only last long enough for 2 washes of my thick, super curly hair (and that's using it sparingly). With this bigger bottle I am able to use as much as I need and it lasts so much longer. I am just now purchasing another bottle after running out last week.
"
"
This has more slip than the original one condition but the smell isn't good.  I love the original smell but it leaves my hair super moisturized and that is the goal.  My bottle top was also cracked when it arrived but I just took it off and used a different cap on it.
"
"
I haven’t used them yet but I have used this product before and I LOVE it. I have great curls from it. I have tried other products and I’ll stick with this one
"
"
This is an outstanding product for natural curly kinky hair!
"
"
Love this product! I've been using devacurl products for years. However this one is the best one yet. I have 3C hair with a slight thicker texture in the middle of my crown. Leaves my hair soft, manageable and super moisturized. This product won't disappoint.
"
"
Excellent shampoo for curly hair.  Diminishes tangles and makes hair shine.
"
"
Do not buy from here its a watery fake
"
"
The artificial perfume smell is SO strong. I'm surprised there aren't more reviews commenting on this. It's almost like a heavy cologne smell. Returning it due to this, though it works great on my curls, I can't handle the smell.
"
"
I can’t live without it. It’s magical. It makes my coarse and at the same time fine naturally curly hair manageable.
"
"
Disappointed.  Didn't smooth my curls at all. Does not smell pleasant either
"
"
This conditioner is worth the price.
"
"
This is a miracle conditioner. We have been using deva curl for years but this formula really detangles  and moisturizes creating beautiful curls. I use it on my granddaughter to avoid pulling her hair so much. I recommend this to everyone with curly hair.
"
"
I love this product, but the top of the bottle doesn't open.  I'm returning it.
"
"
Good product.
"
"
Sucha dissapointment, something so expensive and so little moisturizing, the only good thing is this makes detangleling easy, but even the botle was kinda cheap.
"
"
Love it
"
"
I have mildly curly hair and live by DEVA products.
"
"
Makes hair soft and manageable
"
"
Deva Curl for years... I like the idea of this new decadence One Condition. Not sure if it's better than the regular, but it seems to work well for my curly hair.
"
"
It smells exactly like the usual decadence i get from devacurl but feels a little thin so it doesn't feel like i am getting the best use of it, probably will just get it from ulta or devacurl site next time
"
"
Conditioner is excellent. Bottle not so much, as the pump doesn't work.
"
"
This conditioner has made all the difference in the appearance of my hair. Loosens my naturally tight coils and leaves them shiny and soft. Best conditioner I've ever experienced for my hair.
"
"
Really nice for the hair. I no longer need to use a( much more expensive) mask.
"
"
Softens dry and frizzy hair.
"
"
I live in the desert and I have very frizzy,/curly hair.  This product, and its companion no-poo cleaner are lightweight yet moisturizing.  I haven't used shampoo on my hair for years, and I fly through ""salon quality"" conditioner because my hair is so dry.  This stuff is definitely worth the money--I use less conditioner, and the no-poo cleanser actually makes my hair feel softer instead of brittle, like most shampoos.
"
"
I love this conditioner. It is the only one that leaves my hair soft and frizz-free and it has a great coconut smell.
"
"
I really like sent of this product and it made my hair soft but...it made my scalp have sores on it. I never get scalp issues but I did with this product. Stopped using it and now all clear. Ended up throwing out so sad
"
"
Dispurses through my hair wonderfully.
"
"
The best and only thing I can use on my hair. Due to auto immune issues my hair was falling out and this saved my hair. No more problems with my hair anymore.
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
I've tried everything there is to try this is all i needThe best there is leaves my hair solf n smell so good .if i use only Deva curl products. Thanks Deva curls
"
"
I’ve gone back and forth with this product for years. I can get suckered into something new for curly hair. Every time I come back to this product. The smell is wonderful and conditions exactly how I need it to.
"
"
For my curls.  Stylist recommended
"
"
thick and  waxy, does not condition. Rather, made my hair look greasy.
"
"
I normally use this product and love it, but this particular one has a weird consistency. It’s so thick that it won’t come out of the bottle. I have to take off the top and shake several times for it to even come out. Not sure if it’s defected or what
"
"
first use my 3 year old has curls for the first time in her life. Major virtual hug to the maker of this product!
"
"
Once I started using this my curls came alive
"
"
This is great for curly hair.  I wouldn't be without it.  I leave a little on the ends to keep my hair moisturized and looking great.  Afterwards I use a gel or other product that seals in the moisture.
"
"
My hair is really soft.
"
"
Great conditioner for my 3c hair, a bit pricey but ultimately worth it.
"
"
It is amazing!  I use the Devacurl Decadence conditioner and the No-Poo Decadence cleanser.  Finally, my hair feels super moisturized, soft, not heavy or greasy, and clean!
"
"
Great product
"
"
Best condition I ever tried.
"
"
Great value
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and this product is fantastic in bringing out the curl. I will continue using it.
"
"
The only conditioner I use for my curly hair. Have been a loyal customer to this brand for over three years and it's transformed my hair.
"
"
The product I  the bottle is NOT the product on the label. This is NOT the Devacurl decadence conditioner. Do NOT purchase
"
"
Thanks
"
"
I’ve used this product for a while and it never disappoints. My hair is soft and smooth.

Love this Conditioner and my favorite part is that you can use it as a leave in as well. I have very curly 3b hair with a lot of volume and this conditioner controls it and leaves it looking all moisturized. I don't usually have to use any other product on my hair, I just rake the conditioner through and let air dry.It's not heavy either: and the smell is great! Not over powering and you can still get random hints of it throughout he day.I'm always getting compliments on my hair (how it looks and how it smells) when I use this!
"
"
This product works great - better than the regular One Condition. The reason I give it only 3 stars is the fragrance. It is so strong that it gave me a migraine and it violates my workplace fragrance-free policy. PLEASE make an unscented version of this product!
"
"
Causes hair loss and scalp irritation.
"
"
I use this product all of the time.
"
"
Softest and healthiest my hair has ever been! Curls are very defined and springy
"
"
This is the only conditioner that encourages and allows my hair to curl the way it's always wanted to. I love it. Never have a problem with my hair being dry since I've started using this.
"
"
Been using Deva products for about 6 years and I am never going back to straight hair!

Necessity for curly hair
"
"
This is the best conditioner for my curly hair that I have ever tried. I have been using it for about 2 years now and love it!! Would definitely recommend to anyone who has curly hair. It is very moisturzing yet does not weight hair down. It has really help decreased frizz for me too.
"
"
My daughter has extremely curly hair and loves Devacurl products! We highly recommend them!
"
"
Good
"
"
Best i have ever used. Makes my hair so soft and manageable.
"
"
I love this product but I’m sure that mine came in watered down. I still have some left that i bought from Deva Curl directly and it is much thicker than the one I got from amazon.
"
"
LOVE DevaCurl products. FAST shipping, SECURE packaging. FAIR Price. Will buy again!
"
"
Makes my hair so soft and silky and my curls never looked better
"
"
Moisturizes curly hair. Great costumer service. Delivery date exceeded expectations.
"
"
I love this product ( my 2nd time buying ) but 1/4 of it was lost due to it leaking
"
"
Product smells much better than previously.  However, with all Deva Curl products I always feel every 3rd or 4th wash I must use a regular shampoo to remove product build up.
"
"
Love this
"
"
My favorite conditioner
"
"
arrived perfect quality
"
"
As many people said, it's definitely not as thick as the original. I don't hate it but I'm only using it because it's paid for and not cheap. I won't be buying it again!
"
"
I live this product. Scent is soft,  moisturizes, and its not heavy on my hair. Leaves my hair soft and manageable.
"
"
Great smell, great conditioner. Takes all my knots out!
"
"
Devacurl is a must for curly hair
"
"
Love this stuff. The best conditioner and it smells great. Amazon also sells it for the best price.
"
"
Love it
"
"
LOVE DevaCurl products!
"
"
I had an experience with the product not smelling the way it should and the consistency being thinner than usual. The seller was good about handling my concern.
"
"
Love this product. I've been using it for years. Moisturizes my hair well & it curly girl method approved!
"
"
Love the Deva Curl product line!!
"
"
It leaves your curls very soft and they are not frizzy.
"
"
Great product and prompt shipping.
"
"
Keeps my hair from fuzzing up in this humidity.  Love it
"
"
Great price! Love this oriduct
"
"
Works amazong on curly hair
"
"
love it
"
"
With the pump bottle the conditioner is thiner and is drying out my hair. Hate it. Smaller nonpump bottle of the same conditioner worked great.
"
"
If I could give this product no stars I would. This product has cause major scalp irritation.
"
"
The product is worth it. It leaves my hair very soft, moisturized and bouncy!
"
"
Not for my hair unfortunately. Thankfully they are accepting a return on it.
"
"
Nourishing
"
"
Love it and my hair is not failing off either!
"
"
I love the devcurl products, but I'm not sure this is a legitimate seller... The conditioner seems watered down. I've had to use twice as much to detangle my curls.
"
"
Works great!
"
"
This product is fake. Do not buy.
"
"
I didn't like the smell and it seem different from the Devacurl I've purchased in the store
"
"
Great product for curly hair . I try others  and I come right back to this one
"
"
Works great, smells great, my hair looks terrific.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Works great as usual.
"
"
Wonderful conditioner
"
"
Super moisturizing! I'll be buying this again!
"
"
Super thick and moisturizing. Love it
"
"
Truly can't go wrong with Deva Curl for curly hair! I don't use anything else.
"
"
Es bueno.
"
"
I have very curly hair and I love this product! However when it arrived the lid was open and conditioner had spilled everywhere so that's a bummer.
"
"
Product had opened and leaked. Box was small and hardly an padding/ bubble wrap. Disappointing with such an expensive product.
"
"
I love this product but my bottle came with the pump completely shattered.
"
"
Wonderful product that works so well for my tight curls but it came in horrible packaging. It came completely wrapped in bubble wrap which had caused it to press the push part down and leak everywhere.
"
"
Seemed kinda watered down and it ended up taking a lot more product that I have needed to use in the past to untangle my hair.
"
"
Best DavaCurl product of them all.
"
"
Great product, Love it.
"
"
its ok conditioner I have used better
"
"
Prefer the original One Condition and don't care for the fragrance of this version. Aside from that, it works really well
"
"
Do not use!  Causes hair loss and breakage. Do your research.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Wife loves it for her naturally curly hair.
"
"
My favorite conditioner, leaves my hair soft and smooth.
"
"
Great product, feels lightweight and keeps my hair moisturized. I have 3c/mainly 4a type of curls.
"
"
very thick great for natural hair
"
"
Exactly what I wanted
"
"
When I opened the box the cap was loose and spilled a lot of product all over.
"
"
I have very curly dry hair and this product adds moisture and shine
"
"
I love everything about this product
"
"
I bought this for my girlfriend and her curls have never looked so good. Absolutely love this product.
"
"
It truly works wonders!!!
"
"
My hair loves this stuff.
"
"
Love devacurl but this product is way too heavy on my hair. Wish I could return it. Going back to the original formula.
"
"
Product was good, but bottle was broke and the product leaked during shipping
"
"
Great product for curly hair! Deva Curl is the way to go!
"
"
This didn’t wow me- thin consistency and not very moisturizing.
"
"
Love this product! Great price!
"
"
Wonderful product. Deva Curl is awesome.
"
"
Ordered 2 bottled. Wrapped in plastic. One had come loose. 1/8 product missing. I smelled it as soon as I opened the box.
"
"
Love it. Smells great, works great
"
"
Great Product !
"
"
Best conditioner for dry curly hair
"
"
I can't use any other conditioner on my 3c curls!
"
"
Love the product but 1/3 of it spilled out during shipping :(
"
"
Great  product for curly hair
"
"
smells great! and works very well on my curls
"
"
Love the smell!!!
"
"
I love devacurl and so when I ordered it here for a decent price I fell in love , its everything as described!!
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
Love how it makes my curl look and feel!
"
"
I am a long time user of the One Conditioner. The Decadence did not smell as good and conditioned no better than the original.Also, the pump had twisted loose during shipping and the contents leaked all over the packaging. Not a great experience.
"
"
Works great. Will buy again.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
My curls actually feel silky, even the next day. I woke up the next morning after using this conditioner and I didn't have the typical fuzz at my crown, just soft shiny hair. It's a small miracle.
"
"
I have very long tangly hair. However, this conditioner works magic. Love the way it leave my hair detangled. Huge fan!
"
"
Package was compromised and pump is broken.
"
"
Makes your hair soft and moisturized
"
"
It arrived really quickly but it’s drying my hair out, which is unusual since I’ve been using this product for over a year. Something is off.
"
"
Great conditioner
"
"
Great for Curly Hair
"
"
like conditioner one better. too heavy but, still love deva curl
"
"
A good hydrating conditioner.
"
"
All the products i’ve recived were opened & used!!!
"
"
Love this!!!
"
"
Love this stuff! It's a great conditioner for my curly hair and a great detangeler. I also use as a leave in conditioner.
"
"
It give me a nice curls!
"
"
I ordered conditioner but got no poo. Just realized it. And I’m out of conditioner. Super awesome!
"
"
i bought the wrong product.
"
"
I’m sure that the product it nice but it spilled all in the box it was delivered in so I won’t be able to use it
"
"
nice
"
"
I have super long thick, yet fine, corkscrew curls.  Decadence No Poo and One Conditioner are wonderful - make my hair so soft and smell great.  Also easy to detangle hair and you may use One Condition as a leave - in.  Love this product!
"
"
Love deva curl products, leaves my curls soft and no frizz.
"
"
Very good product
"
"
works great
"
"
Broken pump upon arrival
"
"
Love this product! Leaves my hair soft & silky smooth. My curls are beautiful & manageable
"
"
Awesome stuff.
"
"
Very good. It conditions my hair better than regular deva conditioner.
"
"
This conditionare always works well. It's the best for curly and frizzy hair.
"
"
Aok
"
"
This conditioner is wonderful for my daughter's super thick spiral curly hair! It completely takes the frizz away!
"
"
The best for curly hair!
"
"
I have never used the official product so I'm not totally sure about the product's authenticity. The smell is odd. The best way I can describe it is creamy. It's tolerable but you don't want it in your hair. I personally though this might be the no-poo and not the conditioner when I first bought it but since my hair has grown longer, my hair responds to it better. When I use it, it is just as a detangler before I shampoo or if I run out of my favorite conditioner. I won't buy again but it may work for someone else.
"
"
Expensive and overly rated. Not worth the money.
"
"
I really like this curly hair product. The 4-star rating is because of the fragrance- it is way too strong for my liking.
"
"
I hate the new Decadence line from Deva Curl. I have used their products for almost a decade.. My go-to choice for YEARS was the discontinued formulations No Poo and One Conditioner for Color treated hair. This new formulation is truly awful. My hair reacted badly to it, it became stressed, unruly- frizzy, and brittle. This has not changed over acclimatization time. This formulation has significantly set my hair condition back to the days of mainstream shampoos and conditioners. Gone was the gentle and lovely EO scents, now mainstream style per-fumy scents that give me an instant headache EVERY time I use it.  The consistence of the products  is thin and watery not the thick lush lovely conditioning my hair received from the discontinued product that left my curls gorgeous.  I am beyond disappointed. So very sad.
"
"
I love the product but when I opened the protected plastic that was around the bottle a lot of conditioner had leaked.
"
"
Product came as expected, the real thing. I love this conditioner
"
"
Love deva products especially at lowest prices anywhere.
"
"
I had been a Devacurl one condition original user for a couple of years, but felt like I wanted something heavier just last year. Unfortunately I was reminded why silicone is not a good choice for me. Luckily I found out devacurl came out with new options and decided on this one based on my hair type (not sure it's special number code). I used this right after an experiment with a horribly drying shampoo, and it completely hydrated my hair! It also makes it feel thicker, which I love since I have fine hair. I even tested the hydration by straightening my hair, and it worked really well at keeping my hair quenched and giving my hair body and shine! I love this. And I like the milky smell to it. Will continue to use.
"
"
The smell is horrible :/ I have to return
"
"
Very fast, not problems
"
"
Great price!
"
"
I finally love my hair
"
"
This is the best conditioner that I have ever used ! Their products are the best.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Really helps with moisture in my hair
"
"
great product
"
"
Love this product! Finally love my curl again after using this shampoo and conditioner
"
"
My hair is very curly, thick and dry this is great for my hair. This conditioner is all I use now.
"
"
Best slip for detangeling of any product ever!  So moisturizing!  The Decadence line is definitely my Holy Grail!
"
"
For my super dry curly caucasian hair this stuff is a godsend.  I have tried many other [cheaper] alternatives, but always came back to the original deva one conditioner.  Now that the Decadence is around I stopped even trying to find a cheaper alternative - the slip to this conditioner is amazing.  If you are a curlygirl, I would not use this as a leave in - and I can usually leave weekly conditioning oil in my air!
"
"
I love the softness of my curls and it smells wonderful!
"
"
I'm not in love.  I have thick curly hair and use the One Conditioner. I was hoping this new Decadence would be thicker and silkier, but my curls feel really coarse and are super hard to untangle. In the bottle the smell is great, like a pina colada.  In my hair it smells like a wet dog. I won't be buying this product again.
"
"
Keeps my curls soft.
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!!
"
"
I've used this product since it came onto the market but it is hard to find locally without driving into the bowels of horrendous traffic and awful national chains. If I could buy it at a locally owned shop, I would but I can't. It's an excellent product for anyone with delicate curly hair.
"
"
I have for using the original DevaCurl One condition for almost 3 years. So, wanted to give this new product a try. Definitely not as good as the original love. I use one condition as a co-wash and little leave in. But this product is not moisturizing enough for some reason.
"
"
I've been using Deva products for years and couldn't be more disappointed. This conditioner is awful. It is nothing like the One Condition Deva. It left my hair dry and frizzy. Results were like using a cheap hotel product. What a waste and disappointment.
"
"
My hair LOVES this stuff.  I've been using DevaCurl products for quite a while, but my hair was really dry and frizzy.  This stuff rocks!  Much better than the regular conditioner.
"
"
I think this might have damaged my hair, and without a doubt it didn't help it.  I have thin, apparently fragile hair and after using this one time, I have many broken hairs and frizz all over the place!
"
"
This was not an authentic DevaCurl product. The consistency, smell, and performance were way off. I'm very disappointed. Do yourself a favor and buy directly from the company or from a salon/store you can trust.
"
"
Been using One Condition for years as a leave in and love it.  Tried this just to change it up but its not as thick.  Not sure why its considered a heavier conditioner, I find it lighter.  Once done with bottle going to switch back to the original.  Still a great product but not as good as One Condition (which smells better too).
"
"
It is nothing like the One Condition Deva.  My hair looked horrible with it and I am a big big DEVA FAN!
"
"
I mistakenly bought decadence. It's completely different than DevaCurl One Condition (without decadence in the name). I am sad. Smells like any generic coconut conditioner and leaves my hair feeling the same. Someone warned me about discounted diva curl as not the real thing... I kind of wonder...
"
"
Great conditioner like it better then the other except I am allergic to it.  Soar throat, rash and breakouts in the hair.
"
"
Love, love the product. Great for curly hair
"
"
Horrible! Dried up my hair scalp. Fragrance is too strong. Going back to my other brand.
"
"
so far used it to comb my hair in a pony tail. haven't washed with it yet. smells better than the original Deva curl one conditioner. makes my hair soft. thick and smooth.
"
"
Leaves my hair crunchy and dry. No moisture at all. No good for my dry, porous, 3c and 4a type hair.
"
"
This is the holy grail for my hair. It washes my hair great and I see the difference in my hair
"
"
I like the diva line products, but i'm still searching for the exact combination of products for my hair.
"
"
I received my item in a timely matter, however there's a hole in the bottom of the bottle. The conditioner was/is leaking out of it.
"
"
Product not as advertised. It was not one condition decadence. It was the standard one condition. It also did not have pump top.
"
"
This is not the Devacurl conditioner. Smells completely different and also feels different. I have no idea what I just put on my head, since the product clearly does not contain the ingredients listed on the bottle.
"
"
I like many of the DevaCurl products including this conditioner.  Helps keep my hair healthy and doesn't have some of the really nasty ingredients that harm your hair.
"
"
I spent the money thinking that this would be the same product that I found at my saloon... but this isn't the same thing. It's not as creamy nor as thick as they claim. My hair started falling extensively the first time I tried it. I tried it a second time to make sure that it wasnt just a bad hair day..: I have used it twice so far and wish I had never wasted my money. If you want the real deal- please go to your  local saloon to buy it.
"
"
The scent is off
"
"
Love this product! Hair had been over processed with straightening and coloring so it looked like I had a wreaked beach wave. After switching to decadence one condition and no poo wash my hair is at a 3b curl level (check Pinterest for curl levels).  It is worth getting the larger 32oz size as your hair remains hydrated and allows you to go days between full wash. I use this conditioner as a way of refreshing hair between washing pending workouts, etc.
"
"
At first, it worked great for my daughters hair. Helped it grow and all. But with continual use over a wife’s months, her hair started to become dry and brittle. I thought it was something I was doing wrong but once I switched to a new shampoo and conditioner her moisture has started to come back along with the use of hair oil and a new hair care routine. Will never use this stuff again.
"
"
Smells deceptively ok in the bottle but when applied to hair is a horribly strong, heavy, fake/ chemical perfume smell. Literally lasted for days - 2-3 days later still smelling it in hair. Not at all like the regular one condition or gel products - those scents are light and don't linger . Can't stand it, even though makes beautiful curls. I called Devacurl and they offer no scent-free versions of any conditioner. Total shame!
"
"
Not sure why all the poor reviews. I love this stuff! My hairdresser taught me to keep it in (don't rinse out) and then towel dry my hair (I use a tshirt). My curls are soft, and my hair looks so much healthier. Been a curly girl forever and this is the best product I've used.
"
"
I love love love this product. It smells amazing, very lightweight (I have type 3b curly hair so this is good for my cowashing days) and it defines the curls and makes them very soft and touchable.  The only problem is that i have to apply alot of it if I want to use it as a leave in and since this product is more on the expensive side, that is a bit of an issue. But, it is very great to use to detangle in the shower as well.
"
"
Never order again loss my money but experience
"
"
Best hydrating conditioner EVER! I use it to wash my hair with daily (no shampoo). My curls love it!
"
"
I love the way my hair looked . What I didn't love were the hives that formed and ended up bleeding . My head , neck , shoulders , chest , anywhere the conditioner touched when I rinsed in the shower is covered in large Welty hives . :(
"
"
Love this. I had very dry curly hair and this along with the clense has made it feel & look healthy. I've given away my shampoos with foliate. Strickly using this.
"
"
My hairdresser uses on my hair and it’s a great product
"
"
I normally love this product, but did it change or is this the real product?  The smell is awful ... industrial smelling.
"
"
I love this product and the packaging was perfect.
"
"
The best conditioner on the market for my 3B biracial hair.
"
"
I have been using DevaCurl conditioner daily for a few years, and when I needed a refill decided to try this one.  It does seem to be more moisturizing; jury is still out on whether it's worth the extra $$ that is being charged for it.One star deducted because the shipping was TERRIBLE.  Despite being billed as Prime shipping, it took 9 days to arrive.  Also arrived with a busted pump.
"
"
I don't love their entire line, but I keep coming back to their conditioner. It doesn't provide a lot of slip, so I have to use more than I would of say Biolage (what I've used for years!), but it is a lot more natural so I like that.  After rinsing out with cold water I take my soaking wet hair and apply like a half tsp of coconut oil to my hair and scalp and wrap it with a microfiber twistie turbie. This gives me the best curls!  The coconut oil really helps lock in the moisture but it works best on soaking wet hair!  If I wrap in a towel before applying the oil it just gets frizzy, as it's hydrophobic, the oil is a barrier so if there isn't enough water on the hair, its really just sealing the moisture out instead of in.  Too much coconut oil and you look like a grease ball lol.  I am pretty dry person, It takes a week for my hair to get oily.  So I only wash my hair twice a week.  The coconut routine has helped with my dandruff, but again, it's important to apply it while your scalp is still soaking wet and only a tiny amount, I just use whats on my finger tips.
"
"
I’ve been using the DevaCurl products for several years now. I like the way it smells and feels and makes my thick coarse hair soft and with excellent curl definition. I’m the kind of curly girl that almost never actually uses even the No Poo shampoo. I slather on the conditioner, work out the tangles,  don’t rinse it out at all, and let it dry naturally. I’ve tried other hair products that are sulfate free, no parabens or silicones, but DevaCurl is the one I always come back to because it is so reliable. Another plus—it’s cheaper to get through Amazon than to buy it at other salon stores!
"
"
This stuff smells like Johnson & Johnson, not Devacurl. It does absolutely nothing for my hair unlike the real Devacurl conditioner. Felt like I was putting body lotion on my hair when I used it.... no thanks.I noticed other reviewers had the same complaints before I purchased but decided to give it a shot since some people seemed to have received the real thing. I have no idea how Amazon continues to sell a product that has 0 quality assurance/is not legitimate, but it's definitely making me rethink other purchases I make on here.Not worth the risk, especially if you're unfamiliar with the product and may not be able to tell if you've received a (terrible) dupe.
"
"
It's so difficult to find SOY FREE hair products that are kind to my natural curls! I never used the original DevaCurl conditioning products for this reason but now I'm so, so happy I'm able to use Deva products because my hair loves it! I have 3a/3b curls and I use this every time I wash. My curls seem revitalized and bouncy. I personally enjoy the smell and will definitely pick up another bottle when this one runs out!
"
"
This is a vast improvement to the original One Condition. My hair has pencil sized S curls, coils and tight frizz without product. I use this to condition after cleansing with NoPoo Decadence. Fabulous detangler just using fingers, then run a wide tooth comb through once to remove any shed hair before rinsing. I use this as a curl styler as well, adding another product's styling paste where I have frizzy patches (crown) and for lift. No root clips needed!
"
"
I’ve been using deva curl products for around 3 years now and have ordered them from amazon from time to time with no issues. This time however, the conditioner I received is nothing like what I’m used to. This product smells like chemicals and plastic rather than the normal floral scent that the decadence conditioner has. It also is not as thick and rich as the teal product. Finally, when I used it on my hair it made my hair very dry and tangled. I will no longer order any more deva curl products from amazon. Buyer beware!
"
"
I have struggled to find hair products that actually work with my hair. No need to look any further.  I use this conditioner for all my hair care needs.  I use it as a conditioner but also apply to my hair when wet or dry as a styling cream.  Leaves my curls hydrated, defined and looking good for days! ( I only wash my hair a couple times a week).  This can be heavy for daily use for some so test on your own hair but this has made me love my hair, finally!
"
"
KNOCKOFF! Do not buy. Arrived wrapped in three usps bags, broken top and oozing conditioner. Daughter has insane curly hair and was forced to accept and use it. Smells like paint and cardboard. Left her hair heavy, lifeless and gross. Been using Deva Curl decadence for years from Ulta. Read ingredients - not the same, and label not the same as purchased from the store. Contacted amazon for a full refund.
"
"
I really like this conditioner. The smell is really strong the first time you use it, but the second time I didn't notice it.I felt like my curls were more moisturized and defined than they've been in a long time.I wash with apple cider vinegar, detangle with this conditioner then leave it in after adding Deva Curl gel and squeezing out the excess.
"
"
This stuff is great! I've been using it for over a year now, and I love it!  My hair is much healthier now that I've stopped using all those terrible detergent shampoos and conditioners that just coat your hair instead of bringing out the natural beauty and curl.  No more dry hair for me!  It's silky and soft and shows a beautiful natural curl that I get compliments about.
"
"
It is just this year that I started using the Deva Curl products.  And I love them all!  For years I fought my curly hair and tried to beat it into submission.  I don't have to do that anymore.  And my hair is so much softer, and I don't have to put so much time, energy (and curlers) into my hair.  I wash it with No-Poo, use the conditioner and a spray between shampoos.  Easy!  Love it!
"
"
Great product at a reasonable price. Has helped with thinning hair. My daughter’s hair started thinning and falling out. This helped keep it from falling out and thickened her hair in just a few weeks.  She said it makes her hair soft, less frizzy and shinier. It also has a light and nice scent. Highly recommend DevaCurl and seller.
"
"
Love this product, it’s a must have for my naturally curly hair to stay soft. Only gave it a 3 because i wouldn’t buy from this seller again. it came open and messy. At least it was in a bag so it wasn’t too bad. Could have happened during shipping since there was no packaging in the box to hold it in place. But the plunger doesn’t work either, so that’s annoying too
"
"
My stylist warned me about purchasing salon quality products from Amazon and I should’ve listened. This is NOT Deva Curl. The product doesn’t even smell the same. I have been using Deva Curl on my thick, naturally curly hair for years- and this is NOT it.DO NOT BUY!! Not even sure what this is- but my hair is hard and breaking off.
"
"
I have combo hair - it is very curly underneath and straight on the top. I'm overall really happy with the product as I was looking for something to support the curls, however, I still have the frizz. Bummer...So if I could create a conditioner that has the curls retainer of this plus the moisturizer of lets say...Humectress! That would be the 5 star all the way around.
"
"
This new line from DevaCurl is fantastic! I have naturally curly hair, and over the years have used every product I could find. Some work, some clearly didn't as evidenced by my either flat, weird hair, or my hair that looked like I stuck my finger in a light socket. DevaCurl products help keep it curly and happy! The new Decadence line is thicker, conditions more than the ""regular"" and smells fabulous. I would say if you have sensitivities to scents, I would try a smaller bottle first, it's very fragrant, and sticks around for a bit. Great stuff!
"
"
I have purchased this size directly from Devacurl and at salons. It is always sealed. This came with the foil seal missing and smells different than the bottle I have at home.
"
"
I had been wanting to try DevaCurl products for a long time so I finally purchased this conditioner. This product almost seemed like it was watered down. I'm talking I would have to pump like two big handfuls to cover my hair, and my hair is like medium length. I am going to give DevaCurl another try as they are so highly rated, but I'll be buying elsewhere. I truly don't think this product was real, as it really did nothing to help my curls. In fact my hair didn't really feel conditioned at all.
"
"
I will never buy another brand for my curly girls’ hair. There is NOTHING on the market that comes even close to how wonderful these products are. Devacurl is worth every single penny. You get what you pay for, so if you’re looking for cheap prices, expect cheap products and results.
"
"
I have very fine flat silky lifeless light brown hair naturally and get bleach highlights every four months but I've been getting a perm every six months and this as well as other Deva Curl products have literally kept the perm curly/wavy and has saved it from getting too dry.
"
"
This is a LIFE saver for anyone with curly hair. I was advised by a Deva Cut specialist to put this on my wet hair and use my fingers to comb it into my hair, with my head down so my hair doesn’t get too flat on top. I don’t need to rinse it out. Everyone’s hair is different but this conditioner and technique works for me. I have recommended it to all my friends and family with curls.
"
"
THis is NOT the deva curl decadence one conditioner. It is counterfeit. I have been using deva curl products for 5 years so I am familiar with the one condition and this is not it. What is in the bottle does not smell like deva curl one conditioner and does not work at all. It does not detangle my hair. Do not buy from this seller.
"
"
This has been my favorite conditioner for my curly hair for 5 years now. It is very conditioning and does not weigh my hair down. It smells fantastic and it is well worth the price because it does not have all the added chemicals that drug store conditioners have. Since it is a green product it has made my hair way healthier and it lasts a long time. My boyfriend has even started using it which is saying something!
"
"
The packaging was a mess.  And you could tell that someone had filled this bottle with something else.  It wasn’t even fully filled.  The smell is definitely off, I guess you get what you pay for 🙁. Wish I had sorted the reviews by most recent...super bummed!
"
"
This is an awesome conditioner for dry frizzy curly hair. You can use it as a leave in conditioner or rinse it out to use with other styling products. It has a beautiful fragrance as well. The consistency is fairly light, definitely not heavy. It leaves my unruly curly frizzy hair smooth and easy to style.. This product will definitely encourage your hair to curl so I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STRAIGHT STYLE...  THIS IS MY GO TO CONDITIONER.Very pleased.
"
"
High porosity curly haired peeps who need extra moisturizing may find it with the DevaCurl Decadence. The original DevaCurl condition wasn't enough for my thick 3a curls. My hair just soaks up the Decadence and has more sheen with this conditioner.
"
"
For kinky curly natural hair this is the best product I have found yet.  Deeply moisturizing and defrizzing.  I even use as a leave in andwatered down in a spritz bottle for retouching. One reviewer mentioned it being more watery than the original Condition One.. that must have been a knock off because this product is VERY thick.
"
"
I don't like to spend a lot of money on products, but I splurge for this one. I find it helps with daily control of my frizz and dryness, but isn't quite as thick as I'd like it to be to really stick in, so I need to use quite a bit which gets expensive.
"
"
I have fine, wavy hair, and I live in a desert climate with extremely dry air. This stuff works to keep my hair moisturized, even in the arid climate. It also doesn't seem to weigh me down too much, although my stylist sometimes likes to leave some in after rinsing. I can't manage to do that without it looking greasy, but if my hair was any thicker it would be fine. Love Deva.
"
"
Didn't care for the product. Had to use a lot more than normal with no better results. I mixed it with my regular shampoo. Not worth the price!
"
"
Long time user of DevaCurl products. Also am a regular customer of the salon in NYC. The latest bottle I purchased was a bit off. I think it might have been stored in a hot/damp warehouse or had been on the shelf too long. I'm a big fan of the brand, salon and products. Just got an off batch I guess.
"
"
The oy good thing about this product is the smell..leaves my hair like branches ofwheat.  Not soft at all.  Very bad
"
"
Curly hair's best friend!  I have 3B type curls and I leave this in my hair; I don't rinse out.  It softens and smells great throughout the day.
"
"
Fake and shameful. I try to take care of my daughters beautiful hair. This smells and feels nothing like the real one.
"
"
Didn’t really think there was going to Be that much difference but this is much heavier than the original one. Made my hair flatten out and greasy. My curls take a little coddling - without care, they curls tend to turn to waves.
"
"
My hair dresser recommended this after I was going through weird post pregnancy hormone changes. It helped get my hair back to its soft shiny natural self.
"
"
I've been using this for years and it's the only conditioner I'll use!  Devacurl products are the best.  They keep my hair healthy looking and don't have all of the bad chemicals most curly products use.
"
"
Bought for my daughter who has thick curly hair that is hard to brush. This product is the best we have ever used and it smells AMAZING.
"
"
Great product. I have really curly hair and am constantly looking for something to give my curls some moisture. This does the trick. I sometimes use it as a leave in (really small nickel sized amount) on wet hair. Would buy again. smells good- wish it smelled like the Deva gel though, that smells great!
"
"
Best conditioner for my thick 3c curls. Smells great and adds great hydration for my dry hair. Recently moved from a hard-water apartment to a soft-water home, and Devacurl does an even better job on my hair now.
"
"
Best ever! My granddaughter uses this and this only. It’s great.
"
"
I buy the big containers bc it's the cheapest way. The product is worth every penny.
"
"
Not the real product. It is a watered down version. Or lack thereof. I now only buy from authorized stores. The REAL version make a tremendous difference on my coiffure.
"
"
I use devacurl for all my hair care products. They are a fantastic company, their products smell amazing and leave my hair feeling perfect and give me beautiful curls.
"
"
Products do have an expiration date! This clearly states 2016 Release, last I checked it's 2018. Products usually expire anywhere between 12-36 months...
"
"
Leave my hair feeling wonderful!  I’ve been using the Deva One Condorion for years and decided to give this a try after trying the corresponding No Poo.  Both amazing.
"
"
When I thought deva curl product could get any better, I was proven wrong. I love the new Deva Curl Decadence Conditionaer.  I actually prefer it to the original. It leaves my hair smelling amazing!  I feel like it leaves my hair even more moist then the original. Thank you deva curl!
"
"
Best product for curly har
"
"
Amazing well hydrated, soft and shiny curls like I’ve never had before. Worth every penny. Great selection at Ulta
"
"
This is truly great cream rinse.I have just started using it and NO ITCHING!!! YEAIt also really moisturizes your hair.I had no idea - if hair is really dry to leave some cream rinse in it.My hair feels so good.
"
"
Was leaking
"
"
I have dry hair but I am very sensitive to conditioners. This conditioner makes my hair look soft and feel softer to touch. It does not weigh your hair down.
"
"
The product is great.  However, the packaging left a lot to be desired.  It had obviously been previously opened and then someone tried to re lock the pump.  It was pushed down and taped shut.  Upon arrival, there was conditioner all over the bottle and the inside of the package...a tad messy.  Kept it anyway, although not sure how much was lost...bottle was not full.
"
"
Love DevaCurl products! This is what they used on me during my last visit to DevaChan salon, and I fell in love with the smell and how well it gave my curls some much-needed moisture! Now I use it at home and get to enjoy the scent and great hair days all the time! Would definitely recommend to other curly girls!
"
"
I kept trying other conditioners because I didn't want to pay the price for this, but it was a waste of money.  This is the best for my hair.
"
"
My daughter who has very fine curly hair started using this as recommended by her curly haired specialist hair dresser. We love it! I use the conditioner also in the morning when I just redo her hair a little water and conditioner and vuala her curls are moist and beautiful ....no more tangles that turn to dreads!
"
"
Must have for coarse wild hair
"
"
Awesome stuff
"
"
It came quickly and was very moisturizing!
"
"
I adore this line of product, it makes my unruly curly hair soft, manageable and full of life. However, it also makes my hair fall out in clumps and my scalp sore and tender to the touch after about 6 months of continued use. Immediately upon switching shampoos the hair loss stopped. After much research I discovered it's a common problem amoung users. Not sure if it's due to their formula change or not but I'd rather have frizzy bland hair than be bald.
"
"
I’m not convinced that this is the actual product. The scent is different.
"
"
I love it because of how it works. I do wish it had a better fragrance. I always have to mix it with other conditioner. Smells like a generic motel conditioner.
"
"
this is a great conditioner for my very curly hair. It is thick and creamy and smells great. Have been using it for over 10 years.
"
"
OK all you curl mavens. This is the product. Leaves everything else in the dust IMHO, is light and really amps up the curls
"
"
Love these products for my wavy/curly hair.
"
"
Love this stuff!! Changed my curls. Keeps them looking great all the time.
"
"
My low porosity, dense, 4a hair loved it.  Makes a good leave-in also.
"
"
This stuff works! I used to buy Mixed Chicks, but my hairdresser gave a 16 oz sample of the decadence no pop and this for my daughter to try as a graduation gift and I tried it. Haven't looked back!
"
"
This has been the best product to treat my curls and tame the frizz
"
"
I love the Devacurl products. They tame my friz even in the Florida humidity.
"
"
This product is amazing for natural curly hair.
"
"
My naturally curly son swears by this entire product line.
"
"
I have curly hair that requires lots of moisture, this product along with the Touchable styling cream did not help me, at all. I prefer the Sebastian Drench Moisturizing Conditioner.
"
"
This is my favorite conditioner. Definitely worth the price as it leaves my hair wavy with great volume. Great for conditioner washing.
"
"
I love the smell and how soft my curls are after use.
"
"
I thought it would be thicker, but it works really well. I can always brush the tangles out and it seems to keep my hair less frizzy than when I don't use it.
"
"
Love Love Love DevaCurl products!
"
"
Works great on my Natural curls. The product works without being to heavy on my hair and leaves a lasting effect.
"
"
This stuff works amazing!! Smells so good too!
"
"
Loved it
"
"
Best curly hair product.
"
"
I love this product,it feel amazing in my hair..
"
"
Detangles nicely, but I was expecting more slip. So far, I would rate this #2 right after NYC Curls curl conditioner.
"
"
Keeps curls soft and moisturized
"
"
LOVE this product!!!! It makes my curl soft which I like. It smells good too!
"
"
Love this product! It is a staple of mine, I use it as a leave in conditioner and I saturate my hair with water. A little goes a long way.
"
"
love this stuff!  the smell, the texture and the way it makes my hair feel!
"
"
My favorite!
"
"
Bought as a gift and it was so appreciated!
"
"
Love this!  Works great on my curly hair.  Alot thinner than Deva Curl One
"
"
It’s the only product I’ll let near my curls
"
"
It keeps my hair moisturized and it smells great!
"
"
I love this conditioner, not happy with the way it was packaged.
"
"
Fantastic, my go-to conditioner, for my loosely curly hair.
"
"
Product arrived with broken pump and conditioner leaking out.  Unable to fix the broken pump to use
"
"
I really like this product but I like the original one condition more. I feel like this one doesn't do much for my hair except untangle it.
"
"
Super moisturizing! Love it!
"
"
Great conditioner!  Nice smell, too.
"
"
Loads of moisture!
"
"
Great product for a silky soft hair....
"
"
Every time I get a compliment on my hair I recommend this line, everybody needs to fall in love with their natural curls.
"
"
Works great! I use as a normal inshower conditioner, leave in, and as a styling product!It's great!
"
"
It wasn’t as thick as the small bottle I bought but it was a GREAT price
"
"
This is the best conditioner.  Love it for curly hair!!
"
"
One of the best Deva products. I don't use the shampoo, just this and the ultra gel.
"
"
It makes my scalp feeling itchy when I use it. Don't like that feeling.
"
"
Deva Curl has improved my hair 100 fold!  I will buy their products for ever!
"
"
Throw everything else away. This is the only answer to curl hair woes.
"
"
My hair cannot get enough moisture.  I have fine, super curly, wants-to-be-frizzy, long, dry hair.  It's a commitment, I tell ya!  But my hubby and kids love it, so I won't consider cutting it.  Without this product, I'm not sure I'd have a choice.  My hair just drinks it up happily!  If you don't have super-curly or super-dry hair, this would probably be too much.  But for hair like mine, I use it for most of my cleaning and conditioning (every 2-3 days, with a No-Poo cleansing about once every 2-3 weeks).  I do still use an additional leave-in conditioner (SheaMoisture Strengthen, Grow & Restore Leave-In Conditioner, Jamaican Black Castor Oil) because my hair requires SOOOOOO much moisture and conditioning.  But for many people this would be enough.
"
"
Great conditioner! My curls are so happy
"
"
My daughter using this product and she loves the results.
"
"
This is the best conditioner for curly hair hands-down! Great delivery and I will definitely be buying this product again
"
"
I don't really see a difference between this and the original One Condition but both work very well.
"
"
The only conditioner I use.
"
"
Decadence is more watery than the other One Condition products (In the past I have used both the green and white label One Conditions and love them both!), so it requires that you use more of the product thereby getting less bang for the buck. Given how expensive these bottles are, this is a definite minus.Also, this conditioner has left me with more frizz than I usually have with the other One Condition conditioners I have used. Think I will go back to using them once this bottle is gone.
"
"
Great for curls, read how to use it to get the most out of it.
"
"
I LOVE Deva products, but this one was not great for my hair type. I am a 2b/2c and I found that both the Decadence No-Poo and One Condition weighed my hair down too much. My Deva stylist agreed and said it was likely because my hair is already plenty moisturized.I would recommend this product to someone who needs more intensive moisturizing than the original DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition can provide.
"
"
Great slip. Love this product for my low porosity curls.
"
"
Love this for my curls.
"
"
GREAT product
"
"
I love Deva Curl One Condition!!!
"
"
Love this product, great for leave in on curly or frizzy hair.
"
"
Love love love love love Devacurl!!!!! Every product keeps my hair so moisturized.
"
"
The best conditioner for curly hair ever!
"
"
iconic
"
"
I do love how soft it leaves my hair.
"
"
This product is great but it arrived with a broken pump very disappointed.
"
"
Love the DevaCurl products!
"
"
I wanted to love this product, but it is too moisturizing for my curly hair type.  I have curly hair and this is for SUPER curly hair.  I noticed after using it for several days, my hair wouldn't curl as well after styling which makes me think it is too heavy for my hair type.  Although, I have to say it smells wonderful and feels so good in your hands!!!!  But the the Deva Curl One Condition is more appropriate for my hair type.  I hope they update the One Condition to make it smell more like the decadence!
"
"
Love it! My hair is so much more healthier!
"
"
Was delivered very fast. Very nice. Everything i wanted and more. Would purchase again
"
"
Love his stuff. Have it 3 due to poor packaging.
"
"
Fantastic product, thank  you!!!
"
"
Love love love!!
"
"
Love this product for my coarse curly hair!!
"
"
Love this product for my curls!
"
"
This is the only DevaCurl I can use since it doesn't have a ton of scent. The others produce a migraine rather quickly, this one is migraine free!
"
"
Makes my hair soft, and curls look great!! what
"
"
In part of the deva cult. 14 years deep. This is definitely their most hydrating product.
"
"
I have been a longtime Deva Curl user and have always purchased my products through a salon - and never been disappointed. After seeing all the wonderful reviews here, I decided to order this for the convenience of it and am sorely disappointed. After using this and No Poo Decadence for about 4 weeks, my hair turned dry and brittle. Nothing else changed in my routine other than using this. I kept using them hoping things would get better but they never did. I have since gone back to my salon and purchased product from them and my hair is once again soft and manageable. My stylist said to beware buying these products from non-authorized sellers as the products can be diluted or can be old. I called Deva Curl directly and they confirmed that only authorized sellers have guaranteed products. That means I'm out some cash and just threw away more than half-filled bottles.  :(
"
"
The very best conditioner for curly girls (and guys, I'm sure). My curls drank this stuff up; it took quite a while for my hair to transform from dry to manageable. It may take a couple of months for your hair to look healthy if you're like me, but be patient, it's worth it.I'm not affiliated in any way with the product line, but I swear by the DevaCut and products.(I used to be loyal to Ouidad, but the expense and finding a trained stylist in my area was a deterrent and frankly, my hair looked better with a professional DevaCut.)NOTE: Use only fingers to ""comb"" through hair, never a tool like a comb or brush, just never, not with curly hair.It's a great product and I like the way it smells. I use it daily, even on non-hair-washing days. After experimenting, I leave a dollop in my hair after running my fingers through roots to ends.
"
"
The decadence seems to leave some sort of buildup I can't wash out and I had to stop using it. The original One Condition is much better. This is coming from someone with very thick 2C high porosity hair.
"
"
Unfortunately this is too greasy, leaving my hair WAAAAYYY weighed down. Unless you have really coarse hair that wont go flat under all the moisture this product isn't recommended.
"
"
Disappointing. I thought with a name like Decadence it would be the thickest and most moisturizing of Deva’s conditioners but it is thinner (more liquidy, less creamy) than either the DevaCurl or the DevaCare One Conditioner. Not softening for my 3c curls, no slip at all.
"
"
I have extremely thick curly hair that is very prone to becoming a big frizzy mess. Think Rosanna Rosanna Dana from Saturday night live. I have always been in search of the Holy Grail to tame my hair and so far this is the best it's been. My biggest issue with this conditioner and shampoo is the smell. Regular shampoo brands make a point to make them smell wonderful. This smells like some type of sour lemons. My hair winds up smelling like a combination of wet spoiled fruit and dirty hair. Product good but needs a better smell.
"
"
I love this conditioner so far. Granted I've only used it a week, but it does provides my 3C curls the much needed moisture. I used the Deva curl - one conditioner before this and loved it. So far i haven't seen much difference between the two. I leave it on for 3 minutes or so and rinse it lightly, leaving some of it to act as a leave on conditioner. My curls stay hydrated all day. Would totally recommend this product to people with coily/curly hair.
"
"
Leaves a weird coating on my hair.
"
"
Love Deva Curl - what the heck did they do to the odor? It's horrible... Darn!
"
"
The conditioner is definitely the best part of this brand.  I can do without the no-poo and the coconut stuff because neither help moisturize my hair.
"
"
I didn't understand the purpose of this conditioner.  Deva Curl One Condition works better for me.
"
"
This is awful I can buy bettet products at Marshall's . This is NOTHING like devacare line
"
"
This conditioner does exactly as it describes. It is very moisturizing and it detangles my curls. Lately every time I wash my hair my curls are so incredibly tangled and I didn't know their was a product that could help. This conditioner smells really good and when I follow this up with my Deva curl ultra defining gel the result is beautiful. My curls are soft, bouncy, and layer just right. After I finish my no poo shampoo I currently have my next order will be the decadence shampoo version of this product. This conditioner also does not weight my hair down which many conditioners have done in the best. Great product!!!Jody
"
"
my cousin loves it
"

Makes my hair dry.
"

Great product

Product as described

Too heavy
"

I have been using DevaCurl products for several years with no complaints. My hair looks better than it ever has before. I was interested in this new product, and confidently ordered it, assuming that I would love it as much as all the other Deva products I have used. I would **highly** recommend that you see you if you can smell this at a local salon or beauty supply store before you purchase it. I am very unhappy that I spent $30+ on something that smells this awful. I've been trying to figure out how to describe it, and the best I can come up with is that it smells like cheap floral drugstore perfume mixed with musk and salt. It's gag-inducing. I'm going back to the regular One Condition, having chucked $30 in the trash.
"
"
It's a perfect curl and detangler product
"
"
Did not receive the same which is the 32oz bottle being shown, received the 12oz which this is a picture of a 32oz not 12 being advertised completely wrong. Very misleading
"
"
I bought this locally just because I was out of my HG (KCKT). Normally I'm kind of eh about One Condition but this stuff is actually pretty great. I have 3B/3C type hair and this gave plenty of slip without weighing it down. Unlike some ""more intensive"" conditioners, this gave me an actual feeling of hydration. Normally the intensive conditioners just sit heavily on my hair without doing anything beneficial. I used about a half dollars worth on my ends and it was more than enough for my entire head. Whether it will work on other curl patterns is up for debate, but I like it.
"
"
Sooo if you've ever used Deva before and have been disappointed, this new reformulated conditioner is for you. I had previously use the Deva line and while it initially started out ok, as of late, I started noticing fairy knots in my hair every time they would use it at the salon and I would have to go home and wash it out and start over again with my Shea moisture products. BUT! on my last visit to the salon, right as I was objecting to the use of the line in my hair, the stylist told me that they had reformulated the formula to make one with more moisture for those of us with drier hair. JUST ONE WASH with the NO POO, DECADENCE conditioner AND the Styling Cream and I was again sold. Its been a month with 4 washes(I wash once a week) and I have haven't even had to put any other foreign moisturizer on it (and trust me, I am a shea butter and olive oil junkie) I am absolutely thrilled about this DECADENCE line and a believer in DEVACURL once again. I wash with the shampoo, use the conditioner and while I am still in the shower and my hair is really wet, I put a little conditioner on as a leave in, Once I'm out, I squeeze the excess moisture in a towel and add just a quarter size of the styling cream ( I have short fine, bob length hair) and shake it dry and my curls are popping! (defined and awesome)(This is an honest to God review, I was not paid to do review this, just helping out my fellow product junkie sisters :) TRY IT!
"
"
I purchased the Decadence no poo and condition from my stylist.  I used it for the first time this morning.  I was leary as I have not had good luck with other no poo products leaving my limp, oily and dull.  I have to say I did not mind the smell of the Decadence condition at all, it is light and pleasant and wore off after an hour ( at least I don't smell it any longer). I have 2A waves that pull out and hang if I don't have a good product, and I have to say I am pleased on day 1!  Hair is soft, supple and not oily or weighted down
"
"
I purchased this conditioner And ordinarily I purchase ours from the salon, but this time I purchased here since it could be shipped, we received it and my daughters hair and mine never came out as nice again.  The curls are not as defined and the frizz! I cannot get over the amount of frizz! It seems many people are dealing with these same troubles!  It’s definitely not the same ingredients and the smell is not the same!
"
"
My sister and I both have very tight hair and nothing ever worked until I came across devacurl. Their products have changed our hair to the healthiest its ever been and we get compliments on it everywhere we go. I could not be happier with the result. This conditioner provides moisture and definition for our curls. The product is easy to use and I leaves my hair soft, defined, and touchable. The conditioner can work for all hair types as long as it is in need of some moisture.1. Apply no poo to the scalp and massage with fingers. Wash out by placing head under water and not touching the curls. The pressure of the water is perfect to rinse everything out.2. Place a quarter-sized dollop of conditioner into palm and apply to warm wet hair. Finger comb because most brushes are to rough.3. Use the correct styling product (such as super/styling cream and/or gel) as needed while hair is still wet4. Scrunch hair to get an ultra defined look
"
"
I am going on my 3rd purchase from this seller buying the Devacurl Decadence One Condition and I am in love ! I use it as a Styler and not a rinse out conditioner and it leaves my hair moisturizer smelling lovely and soft. I will use this on my hair forever.
"
"
Love it!!! This is the best there is for curly hair and I have tried every different kind out there!!! It was packaged nicely and I will be buying it again next time I'm out!!
"
"
Great conditioner for people with curly hair! It is formulated without all those harmful ingredients. The ingredients used in this conditioner detangles, moisturizeses your locks and makes it soo soft! I use this product quite often and a little bit goes a long way. I am not a fan of the smell though, it doesn't smell bad at all, it just has this distinct smell that is neither pleasant or unpleasant. Overall, I will keep using this on my hair!
"
"
All I can say is O. M.G . Devacurl B'leavin is God sent for fine hair. I have sooo much volume on 1st day hair!!! Never ever has that happened with any of my hair products. Now I have to say that it took me 2x to use this product to get a grasp on how to use it for my fine, 3b/c curly low porosity hair. Make sure to apply in 4 sections on detangled wet hair after using a really good moisturizing conditioner or leave in because this product doesnt add much moisture alone. Once I applied the B'leavin, I smoothed in a very little bit of Ecostyler Argan oil gel on top to each section for hold, let it air dry, and the results were AMAZING!! I have so much BODY,VOLUME, and SHINE. I'm just shocked and in disbelief. If you are someone with a similar hair texture or fine/thin hair and you want voluminous curls, this product will successfully achieve that once you figure out the perfect amount to use based on your hair's needs. For me a little went a long way but the directions does say to use generously. Trust me, this product is worth EVERY penny!!!
"
"
Great product ! I love the way my hair looks!
"
"
I’ve been hearing amazing things about DevaCurl for years, but the price has always been a limiting factor. So, I was excited to try B’Leave-In from Amazon after a stylist used it on my hair at my most recent cut. This product makes my curls extra soft and springy! Smells amazing too! I was a little worried that the product might not be as high quality coming from Amazon, but the package was aggressively protective (lots of the plastic bubble packing) and the product was clearly labeled as “New” with the seal intact. Very pleased with the performance, quality, and price!
"
"
Love this product. This is a repurchase. Took me awhile to figure out how to use on my hair. But other day on a whim put it between my leave-in conditioner and BounceCurl creme gel and was amazed at my results. Beautiful plump, expanded curls, which is a dream come true on my thinning hair. I was almost out so I ordered this in the pump (LOVE) AND went and bought the regular size locally because I didn't want to risk being without it!! Again, wasn't quite sure how this fit into my routine at first, (I need a true leave in condish), but now it has a permanent place in my routine.
"
"
I have very fine hair that is also thin. I love Devacurl ArcAngel gel, so when I saw how many people like combining it with B'Leave-in, I decided to give it a try. My only regret is that I bought the smaller size. My hair is BIG. I finally have the big, luscious, shiny, bouncy curls of my dreams. B'Leave'in really works as promised- it plumps up my curls without any residue, stickiness or frizz. ArcAngel encourages curl and shine and prevents frizz. The two together are magical.

"
I was introduced to this product during my first Deva haircut. I started with the 8 oz, but knew I had to have the larger size because I use it every time I shampoo or co-wash my hair. I have fine, high/medium porosity 3c-4a curls (Afro-textured), and I love this product. It has a lot of protein, so I don't use it with other DevaCurl products that contain protein; otherwise, it's protein overload (frizz/dryness). If your hair is low porosity, I don't think this will work for you -- your strands are already thick, and you don't need the extra protein.I purchased from this particular seller (it now says Amazon, but it said ""fulfilled by Amazon"" when I purchased). This is a curl primer, so it's purpose is to add fullness and body to curls. I put this on after a leave-in, and before a curl cream and gel. It has the traditional DevaCurl scent, which I love. I will definitely repurchase if it's still available here, and the price doesn't increase substantially. Amazon has become really inconsistent over the past three years, so we'll see.Also, as some other reviewers have mentioned, this was poorly packed. TAPE THE TOP OF LIQUID PRODUCTS, AMAZON! I've ordered several liquid based products, and they have leaked -- leaky packages or broken glass. You get a lower price here, but the products are still expensive.

This gives me great definition without frizz, and it helps with volume. I put in wet hair between conditioner and gel. I could use this alone and get nice, soft, relaxed waves in my 2c, fine hair or pair with another product for bouncy, high def curls. I do wish the volume held over the course of a day without other products for when I feel like going with more subtle waves and want to skip gel or mousse. It smells better than other Deva products I've tried; it smells like grape-flavored candy. Of note: It does not condition and isn't a leave in conditioner, as the name might imply. You'll need to get moisture from another source.

I have very curly, frizzy hair and this has been an amazing product. I use the Deva No Poo shampoo and One conditioner first, and then while in the shower, I apply this to very wet hair. You can get some of the excess water out with a microfiber towel but don’t completely towel dry as it works best if the hair is wet. When I’m out of the shower, I spritz some It’s a 10 with keratin in my palm along with a squirt of Paul Mitchell skinny serum, and then I apply this to my hair while scrunching the curls. It takes some time to dry but your curls will be soft and gorgeous with zero frizz.
"
"
I was so excited to get this but was short lived. Used as directed and finger curled my hair. Once dried, white flake residue alllllll over so I had to wash out. Wasted a bunch of product
"
"
I have a love-hate relationship with DevaCurl. Some of their products are great while others don't do much for me. I found that this was one of the ""doesn't do much"" products. I ended up buying an alcohol-free gel from the grocery store for a fraction of the price, and it works just as well-- if not better-- at reducing my frizz and defining curls. The smell of this product is nice, but it's not worth the price at all.
"

All I can say is O. M.G . Devacurl B'leavin is God sent for fine hair. I have sooo much volume on 1st day hair!!! Never ever has that happened with any of my hair products. Now I have to say that it took me 2x to use this product to get a grasp on how to use it for my fine, 3b/c curly low porosity hair. Make sure to apply in 4 sections on detangled wet hair after using a really good moisturizing conditioner or leave in because this product doesnt add much moisture alone. Once I applied the B'leavin, I smoothed in a very little bit of Ecostyler Argan oil gel on top to each section for hold, let it air dry, and the results were AMAZING!! I have so much BODY,VOLUME, and SHINE. I'm just shocked and in disbelief. If you are someone with a similar hair texture or fine/thin hair and you want voluminous curls, this product will successfully achieve that once you figure out the perfect amount to use based on your hair's needs. For me a little went a long way but the directions does say to use generously. Trust me, this product is worth EVERY penny!!!
"
"
Great product ! I love the way my hair looks!
"
"
I’ve been hearing amazing things about DevaCurl for years, but the price has always been a limiting factor. So, I was excited to try B’Leave-In from Amazon after a stylist used it on my hair at my most recent cut. This product makes my curls extra soft and springy! Smells amazing too! I was a little worried that the product might not be as high quality coming from Amazon, but the package was aggressively protective (lots of the plastic bubble packing) and the product was clearly labeled as “New” with the seal intact. Very pleased with the performance, quality, and price!
"
"
Love this product. This is a repurchase. Took me awhile to figure out how to use on my hair. But other day on a whim put it between my leave-in conditioner and BounceCurl creme gel and was amazed at my results. Beautiful plump, expanded curls, which is a dream come true on my thinning hair. I was almost out so I ordered this in the pump (LOVE) AND went and bought the regular size locally because I didn't want to risk being without it!! Again, wasn't quite sure how this fit into my routine at first, (I need a true leave in condish), but now it has a permanent place in my routine.

B'Leave-In Is a great product. I only need 4 products for my hair. Shampoo, conditioner, B'Leave-In and frizz free volumizing foam. The curls last 3 days.
"
"
This product left my hair extremely dry. Based off the reviews on the deva curl website I thought this was going to be a great product. The smell of the product is not good. It is extremely slippery/slick which I thought would be good. However, this was not the case. I applied to freshly washed hair in sections of 4 and finger combed through my hair. By noon my hair had major shrinkage and was so dry I had to put it up in a pineapple because it looked horrid! Will be returning.
"
"
First off, my hair is curlier than ever, and my curls are better than ever. Round ringlets and much less frizz than before (though there is still some frizz). I will say, though, that maybe you shouldn't apply the product as 'generously' as you think— lest you want dandruff-like white flakes in your hair. That wasn't a good look. However, my curls definitely were! Use this product in combination with good shampoo and conditioner and you're on your way to great hair.

(Picture collage is top without any Devacurl products and bottom is with Deva curl.  Extra photo is side view of my hair without any devacurl.)  Although Devacurl B'leave in does clump my wavy/curls together well, has amazing ingredients and smells natural it just doesn't do it for my thin hair.  It makes my thin hair show up even thinner than usual, unfortunately.  It ends up a lot more frizzy than usual too, which I'm not that worried about....I'm just more worried about volume and having my hair look fuller than it is.  I tried downing the amount I use and only using it on my mid to ends, but then it just doesn't do enough to be a huge ""wow"" factor rather than using no Deva products at all.  Also tried diffusing following tutorials which again, thin hair.  Diffusing just made it more apparent.  I love how everyone's hair comes out in videos/ads and was hoping for that volume and curl definition but looks like this will not be my Holy Grail.  If you have thin hair, like me...this will not do well but only end up highlighting those areas of your scalp where you are balding.

BEWARE! Tried for the first time yesterday. Followed directions and added to just-washed hair. Curls were soft, well-defined, and bouncy. I though the search was finally over for the perfect product. AND THEN I noticed tiny white dots clinging to every stand. Kind of forgot about it until sometime in the afternoon when I was preparing to go into a meeting - white flake residue all over my black sweater. Started with a lint roller, but didn't work. Moved to heavy duty shipping tape - that barely touched it. So I looked like I had the worst attack of dandruff in history. Both embarrassing and disappointing. SLept on it and the same this morning. Only way to get rid of it was to wash my hair again and go back to my old cocktail of products that are barely acceptable. Anyone have a remedy?
"
"
I have fine 3a curls and I really like this stuff, it makes my curls defined without weighing them down or looking crunchy or greasy. You do have to use it correctly though. Put it in after washing or wetting as the last step of your routine before air drying or defusing. Scrunch it in and let curls dry, then scrunch again to break up the slight crunchiness for soft, defined, voluminous curls. Not sure if I like this or the Ouidad volumizing foam mousse better but as a product junky I can say this is a good one and worth adding to your curl routine especially for the price. I think the Ouidad gives more volume but this product gives much better definition so it depends on what you are looking for. Maybe together with my multicultural curl leave-in they will be the holy grail of hair products for me.
"
"
I have about 2b hair and it's difficult for me to find anything that works right for my hair to create definition. Either I find a product that makes my waves too hard and crunchy (yet defined), or they are loose and soft (but quickly lose definition). This product is like perfectly in between. I feel like I have well-defined waves that don't turn into a rat's nest by the end of the day. My mom even noticed the difference and told me that my hair looked healthy.
"
"
I purchased this product thinking it would give more definition to my natural, kinky hair. It does not. I passed it on to my granddaughter who is of Black & Asian heritage, and it works beautifully for her.  So I'll have to give all stars as it does work for someone who is mixed race. She already had pretty hair, now her natural curls are defined and gorgeous!!! She said she applied it while her hair was wet, and she loves it.  I saw it for the first time on yesterday and  WOW!!  So, a Thank You from my Girl and a happy Grandmother!
"
"
I bought this after seeing all these YouTube videos about how great DevaCurl is. I wanted to try it for myself. I really wish I hadn’t. I used this product as instructed on soaking wet hair, after using no poo decadence and one condition. As my hair dried a white film developed on my hair. And I had to wash my hair again to get it out. So I walked around work all day explaining to my questioning coworkers why my hair was chalky looking.
"
"
I'm mostly 3B curly and this works great for me. The niche this fills for me is that I have one piece of hair that sometimes doesn't curl as much as the rest of my hair. This encourages it to form a curl. So, for me, it's not as much about being a gel product that reduces frizz or holds the curl shape. For me it encourages my curl pattern when it's being stubborn. This is especially helpful if I haven't washed it in a few days and I've slept on it a few times. Will definitely be keeping it for part of my routine and glad that I finally tried it.
"
"
Doesn't seem the same as the one I bought directly from DC
"
"
Does exactly what it says it will. My curls have never looked or felt so good.
"
"
I had used the devacurl line before when I wasn’t too interested in getting my natural curls back - i just wanted some good products that could manage my heat damaged curls during my tropical vacation. I wasn’t too fond of the smell either. Now that I’m a “curly girl”, I absolutely love the smell of this product. And now that I’ve learned how I should apply products to my coarse, thin hair, I love the product even more. Application is not and should not be the same for everyone. It makes a huge difference on how the product will perform. And now that I know how to apply this product to my hair, I think it performs fantastically. I love this product now and it will become part of my regulars.
"
"
I LOVE this product.  I used the No Poo cleanser and the Conditioner with the green top (can't remember the name of the DevaCurl product), then put this on my wet hair. then after drying off, I used the Arc Angel.  My hair looks awesome!!  Its not crunchy!  I have 3A curls with baby fine, but almost thick hair.  This stuff is amazing!!!!!
"
"
A bit pricy, but this is the best product I have found for my wavy curly hair. My hair is a bit long, so it can get droopy. This product really works to keep texture and volume. And it doesn’t feel like I’ve got product in my hair. It is still soft. I use a diffuser. My hairdresser (who works in a high end Aveda salon) commented on how soft and healthy my hair seems. I just finger comb it in the morning and I’m ready to go. And if I comb it out a few days later, it doesn’t get that weird frizzy look that I get from other products. Highly recommend.
"
"
This product is a gel and did not work on my hair. It left a sticky residue and I had to wash my hair the next day the several times I've tried to use it. Do not recommend and now I read on new reviews (Feb 2020) that a lawsuit is pending. Since I purchased it in November, I cannot get a refund.  I went back to Sebastian Texturizer.
"
"
This is a cheap fake.I'm sad I can't return mine, as I had set aside for once I finished up current leave in, n then was awfully surprised to find after application n drying... like WHITE COTTON FUZZ in my hair. I appeared S of I hadn't washed my hair in ages!!!!Just no🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫It's just BADDDD.It's bad. Stay away!!!!
"
"
Honestly the absolute BEST curl cream or gel I've ever used!!! It works so well and stops my hair from frizzing or getting big, that seems impossible considering I'm used to being a lady of mixed heritage with BIG hair.;-) Plus the best part, I can change my mind and straighten my hair (after I've used the curl cream in the morning) with zero residue!!! I'll definitely be back for more!
"
"
This is the best curly product I've used! It makes my curls stick together so they look thicker and like a commercial. You don't need that much so the bottle lasts a long time (I think I went almost 4 months on 1 bottle.) The scent is minimal and it doesn't make my hair crunchy. If you have thinner hair and want the appearance of thicker curls, this is amazing!!
"
"
I love Devacurl and I think this would be a great product for someone who has slightly thicker hair but needs a texture boost - NOT someone who has easily weighed down strands, aka, me. Maybe you could get away with it if you use way less than you even think your hair could handle. Mine however, couldn’t. So all in all, I know it works great and many people love it; but if you have thinner hair, use VERY sparingly or skip. An alternative to this product? Aveda Thickening or Volumizing Tonic!!!
"
"
It’s a bit expensive, but now that I’m using Devacurl shampoo, conditioner, and styling products my curls are prettier, more manageable, and they look good throughout the day.  My hair used to look like Hermione’s in the first Harry Potter movie, now I get compliments all the time. My hair became curly after having kids so I was new to the curl styling game and these products have made it so much easier.
"
"
This stuff is amazing! If I use any deva gel alone, I get frizz a few hours later. This completely solves that and makes the next few days of refreshing much easier. I like to use it pretty generously. I have loose curls but thick hair and this does a great job of taming it. I usually have good volume with it too.
"
"
Product does not produce the curls it promises. After the hair dries the curls disappear-- i think the product weighs the curl down. Plus it's a sticky mess to apply on wet hair only
"
"
This stuff is amazing...very curl-enhancing, not heavy or sticky. Blends well into damp hair; I haven't tried it as a curl-restorer in dry hair. Mizani True Textures Curl Enhancing Lotion works equally well, but this DevaCurl product costs a lot less
"
"
I love this product. I use it when my hair is dripping wet before I put in my gel. I really notice the difference if I don’t use it. It controls the frizzies, adds shine and it works well with Deva light defining gel. It may work well with other routines too. I will continue to use it everyday and always get it from Amazon. It’s easy and comes quickly at a competitive price.
"
"
I bought this product based upon the comparisons to Aveda Be Curly and the many positive reviews, but am very disappointed.  This is a gel, not a true curl enhancer.  I have soft fine curls and they were only supported by DevaCurl Curl Plumper if I did not wish to touch, tousle, or mess with my hair.  If I touched the curls, my curls became  frizzy looking ( I have very shiny hair without this product.)  Aveda Be Curly gives support to the hair from the inside--never gel-like or unable to be touched.  I will not be buying this product again and am running to my Aveda store asap.
"
"
I was excited to use this brand of hair products so I purchased this cause I love leave in products . The product is real light and feels real thin . It’s easy to massage through hair but the bad part is that after it dries it leaves white flakes in my hair !!!? And it looks so nasty like I got dandruff or dried up gel in it smh . I did like that my curls looked beautiful and it felt like I didn’t even have any product in it but those white flakes I can’t get over it 😒☹️ So I will not be purchasing this ever again . 2 stars because of the flakes.
"
"
Wow. I'm not sure how but this defines each curl and there is zero crunch or greasy look. I haven't had frizz anymore either. Love love love this product.
"
"
When I use products, I wouldn't say I like using gel or hard stuff on my hair because it leaves dry white flakes and it does not look good. When I placed this in my hair after using all the other products, it did not make my hair any better with the curls. So I will not recommend this to anyone.
"
"
I have tried so many products for my curly hair, and nothing compares to this product. I usually straighten my hair because my curls are straight at the root, curly in the middle and wavy straight at the bottom. Now they are bouncy, my dry ends are even curled. I am in shock how nice it looks, even my daughter who is a hair stylist was like what did you different? My mom also asked me what I used and I only used one time so far.  Why didn’t I try sooner??? My hair looks 1000 times better.
"
"
This is my favorite curly hair product! Coupled with the “praying hands” method, this product holds my curls and they last all day without any crunchiness or frizz!
"
"
Not sure what I think of this product.  I had a day recently where it made my curls look big, bouncy and amazing when I used B-leave in with some devacurl ultra defining gel.  The next time I used it I mixed the b-leave in with the gel and applied at the same time whereas I applied it first, then the gel over the top before.  Not sure why this would've made such a difference but it seemed to.  My curls looked a bit wet/greasy even after they dried and the curls seemed shrunken more than the last time using it.  So at this time I can't say whether I really would add this into my main routine.  So far what seems to work best for me is giovanni direct leave in conditioner (a tall quarter size dollup) and then putting devacurl ultra defining gel over that and styling by combing with a denman brush gently, holding the ends of the section of hair and shaking (the curl pattern will form itself).  I know that dew points also come into play and we had a lot of rainy days with high dew points recently.  But I will keep experimenting and update this review if it becomes amazing and I figure out exactly how to use it optimally.
"
"
This is my holy-grail product. It is the only thing that gives my wavy/curly definition without making it feel bunky and horrible.
"
"
Let me first say a little goes a long ways. I’ve had absolutely no issues with any flaking. And my favorite way to use this product is on a refresh day. I get my hair damp, a dab of B-Leave-In and defuse. Hair has body and refreshed curls. Love it.
"
"
DevaCurl products are generally a hit or miss for me. There are very few  products which can suits my curls and this one is one of the best. Not only does it defines my curls but also leaves it moisturizes. Even when I want to tie back my hair I use it as a gel for wet hair look, even after it dries my hair is in place. 1 star less is because this gel is leaving a white residue which is similar to dust or dandruff which is really off-putting.
"
"
Great product! I love it it does what it saids.
"
"
Thought this was a leave in conditioner turns out the entire line I'd produced is just a bunch of light hold gels I would not have paid this much for gel had I known that.  It doesn't even make my course wavy hair look good  but my mixed daughter with course curly hair it makes her hair look good
"
"
This product smelled very bad because it was past it's shelf life. The products don't have expiration dates, but because they are botanical based, after a while they start to smell bad.
"
"
Smells amazing and defines curls well! I would have continued to buy this product repeatedly - but recently shaved my head. All curly girls - this one's for you! Seriously the scent is like Skittles and candy! I lived being around myself LOL.
"
"
Product is awesome, it adds body to fine curly hair.  This price can not be beat!
"
"
Before you purchase this product look into the current class action lawsuit against Deva Curl regarding ALL of their products. Save yourself the  heartache, hair loss and damage. Take 5 min to look on YouTube to see what is happening to other users.
"
"
The search for the right product continues. I used in combination with and without Deva Curl Low Poo shampoo and Deva Curl conditioner. I used it with other branded products. None of the combinations produced a curl that was soft or frizz free. Made my hair totally gross if I exercised. I'll go back to using Redken Real Control.
"
"
This is a brand I love and adore, I haven't used it yet but it got here very quickly and I am in South Korea! Very pleased about that, I must say! The package was opened when I got it, but I'm sure that had something to do with customs and it still got to me in time and undamaged. It's always a bit expensive to get Deva curl, and shipping to Korea adds to that of course. You just can't find anything for curly hair here... At least I haven't yet.
"
"
Where had this product been all my life  it's made me like my hair. So many products on the market and sometimes they work and most times they don't.  This is an awesome product. I pair it with pattern shampoo.
"
"
Didn't see any difference using this. I tried using my hair care products layering in different orders, and nothing. Tried this alone, and nothing.Two stars for the scent. It smells amazing!
"
"
Please do not purchase Devacurl products!! Many people report losing hair and complete damage to their hair. I unfortunately purchased this prior to making the connection with my scalp issues and have suffered from intense scalp issues and hair loss. There is a class action lawsuit with this company.
"
"
I’m 6 months into the Deva curl method with 3c curls. I’m not a huge fan because I need more of a cast. B’Leave is probably better suited for thinner hair. I use it every so often for the shine, but it compromises my curl cast. It’s definitely not an after scrunch curl calmer. Use in the shower after your gel
"
"
I use this in my Deva Curl cocktail that works well on my curly hair.  I have 3a and 3b curls.  I use this first and then the volumizing foam.  I then use a small amount of the wave maker and then the ultra gel.  My hair and curls come out great.
"
"
This product has helped my hair feel soft and less frizzy.
"
"
This product gives me bouncy curls without the crunch! It is overall a good product but with some use I find that I am not a fan of the lemony scent. Also worth noting that this product leaves my hair a little dry to the touch.
"
"
Okay, this isn't exactly a miracle, but it has a great scent and really helps turn my waves into curls.  I especially love how it leaves my hair feeling nice and soft as well.  Unfortunately, it doesn't completely take away the frizz (what does?!), but it's the closest thing I've found to being the all-in-one product I'm looking for.
"
"
not only is it all natural, smells great and works!!😊...my curls have never been so curly, frizzless or stay for longer then a day! i usually dont write reviews, but this was a must to share!
"
"
This product is so flippin’ amazing. I, for years and years, spent so much on Aveda Be Curly products. And honestly. This is so much better. I have very light but very curly hair. Frizz is a real problem. This makes my curls so much better and manageable.
"
"
Love the fact I got the product ASAP.  Don't like it was in a plastic bag with the top open to spill out, now that was crazy.
"
"
First deva curl product Ive tried. I read some reviews how people were saying it left their hair dry but decided to try anyways. It did leave my hair dry and caused flakes from the gel. Didnt notice any difference in volume. Smells good tho
"
"
It was beautiful the first day but it dries out my hair. I tried it with different product but it just didnt work out for me. The next day hair is just frizzy and dry.
"
"
This keeps my curl shape so well!! I use it alongside Arc Angel gel and I’m obsessed!! Love devacurl so much!! And I’ve read reviews saying this isn’t authentic, but mine definitely is.
"
"
No flaking but definitely makes hair crunchy so if you aren’t into that find something else. I like the idea behind this line of products but this is not something I use often. I would recommend if you don’t mind or prefer the crunch
"
"
I have fine, frizzy curly hair and I use this with my hair soaking wet - works wonders. Usually finger curl the front. I've always used Treseme mousse or leave-in conditioner - wow does this product make a difference in reducing frizz and keeping my curl definition in shine.Highly recommend!
"
"
I recommend applying on wet hair
"
"
My new go to product. works fabulously on my hair, it’s a little pricey, however I’m willing to pay in order to have found a product that works.
"
"
It's cool for a light hold with my wash n go. It has a light fresh scent. Does not mix well with a lot of other leave ins or moisturizers.
"
"
This works perfectly in my 3 year old daughters curly hair. Doesn’t weigh it down, make it greasy or stiff. I really like this product.
"
"
Hi, obviously did not like this product, for the money, there is no Miracle other than the name. Although hair products are not one size fits all, as all hair textures, etc are different, however; this did not do anything promised. Did not pump my hair, the curls did not stay, etc etc.  I purchased it because a friend highly recomended it. Her hair's texture's is like mine.Thank you.
"
"
Do not buy! the brand devacurl is under investigation for putting toxic ingredients in their products making people's hair fall out and causing migraines. Do not buy!
"
"
This product, along with the other devacurl products I used caused major hair loss and loss of volume and definition. Devacurl needs to address this issue and Do some major recalls and explain what happened.

Best product for type 2b curls. Makes your hair so soft and bouncy. I apply this after washing and conditioning my hair. I apply a leave in conditioner, then this product. I apply it with praying hands on my hair.  Then follow with a curl cream and gel. My hair always looks perfect using this on wash day!
"
"
Smells wonderfully but leaves my hair dry. Really wished it worked for me like it seems to have worked for other reviewers.
"
"
My curls stay and look great without the heavy mouse / hairspray mask on my hair.  I can easily run my fingers through my hair.  I would highly recommend this product.
"
"
Its a really nice product but it did bring out my curls like promise.
"
"
I love the Diva Curl products the b leave conditioner and moisturizer are just perfect for my natural hair style. I can adjust my curls from loose to tight by the amount I use.Also my hair is gray/silver and this product does NOT yellow or dull my natural color.
"
"
This truly works for my hair! It totally makes my curls pop more an they are more defined also! It's absolutely worth getting. It was a total Game Changer for my hair, I can't go without this now!
"
"
Tried it 3x. Each time, it weighed my hair down and made it look kinda greasy shortly after my hair dried. Blechh.
"
"
I decided to purchase this product because I’ve heard nothing but amazing things about the Devacurl brand. To be honest, this did absolutely nothing for my curls except dry them up and leave my hair feeling like hay. It was so frizzy and dull I just couldn’t believe so many people hype this brand up the way they do. I ended up throwing it away. I definitely would not recommend this product to any of my curly haired gals.
"
"
I had heard a lot about this product, but it leaves my hair really dry. I use it right after shower and then apply styling cream on top. I haven't tried it on dry hair yet. I've got better results just using styling cream on its own. If someone knows how to use this product, please let me know as it's expensive and I have the whole 16oz bottle still left as I was unable to return.
"
"
I love this product. I’ve order several of these on Amazon and love them.  I’ve also bought these from my salon. Same product.
"
"
I so wanted to like this product. I have used several times and find that it leaves a waxy feel to my curls.
"
"
I am not sure why I waited this long to start using Devacurl. This stuff is amazing. No more bad hair days.
"
"
LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  It provides plump coils and shine.  I finally found a product that works as described.
"
"
If you want to get cystic acne, eczema, and dandruff from using a product while simultaneously frying your natural hair and worsening your curls then this is the product for you.
"
"
This product does not give the greasy look. Makes my daughter curls very defined and soft not crunchy.
"
"
Makes my wavy hair fuller.
"
"
I use this everytime I wash my hair. Quality product, is the real deal. Helps to keep hair moisturized and is a great curl enhancer.
"
"
My curls get a nice volume and frizz control with this product. Love how light is and how great it makes my curls look.
"
"
I only used a dot but it still weighs my hair down a lot. So much so that it actually pulled out a lot of my natural curl. Would not recommend if you have fine, thin hair
"
"
Did nothing for my daughters hair! What a waste of $14!
"
"
It says no paragons, but this is a very waxy and heavy treatment.  I have fine hair and would not recommend this product for that hair type.I just threw the whole thing away, because it doesn't work for me.
"
"
Great for keeping moisture in wavy to curly hair. Even overnight when hair is not completely dry!
"
"
Love this curl leave in. It really does make my hair more of a curl with no stiffness at all. Feels good and natural.
"
"
Works as described. I love this product!  A little too expensive for my liking, but it works great!
"
"
I like the scent and that it seems to moisturize well, however it weighs my hair down and doesn't really hold the curl well at all.
"
"
I love my hair washing products I got from this brand but the leave in seemed watered down or just not as good at all. Very disappointing.
"
"
Woke up with my curls perfect. If you have natural curly hair you know what a treat that is. Usually wake up looking like a lion
"
"
I use this product every day and ordered a new bottle when I ran out. I results I receive from this new bottle of B'LEAVEIN are terrible and nothing like the results I've recieved in this past which makes me wonder if this is a true devacurl product. My hairs a mess....returning!!
"
"
Great for my waves and curls. Gives a nice shine. Not to heavy. Only use a small dime size amount.
"
"
Recently started my curly hair journey , and this product is a staple! I normally apply it after wash my hair , it helps give definition to your curls without drying them out.
"
"
LOVEEEEEEE this, i havent found anything tk help my curls until i found this.  Helpa you wavy hair curl up and last all day. LOVEE THIS BRAND
"
"
I'm amazed at this product!!! My curls are instantly defined and hold all day without being crunchy. After using the product, my hair feels and looks natural.
"
"
Maybe I'm its because I'm used to my regular curl enhancer but it seemed to make my hair stiff and not as free flowing and bouncey as I expected. However, the price is less expensive. I will continue to try it...maybe with less or more wet hair. Thanks.
"
"
This is a decent product but it takes forever for my hair to air dry when I use it and if you too much you will get crunch!
"
"
but still good, i bought one at ulta and the ulta one was definitely better, but it is cheaper and it is still good.
"
"
Love this stuff... keeps my hair from frizzing up! Smells nice and adds a lot of body.... Will be buying again!
"
"
My hair is in a stage that does not accept any product in it, but it has returned volume and I appreciate it, I should only find the perfect complements
"
"
This is my favorite hair product. My hair loves protein and it always looks really good when I use this product. The only thing I dislike is it didn't last very long, but I could have just been using too much.
"
"
I thought a leave-in conditioner would make my curls soft and healthy looking.  This left my hair feeling rather dry.  I'll be-leaving this product off my future purchase list.  Not impressed with any of the DevaCurl products.
"
"
This product doesn’t do the job and my curls are dry and frizzy.
"
"
Wow!  Yes!  Use this with the gel.  Only put it in the middle of the hair.  Try not to get so much on your ends or roots.  This puffs them up, making them look fluffy.  Love devacurl!  Thanks Ayesha!
"
"
Expensive and my hair felt stiff.  I didn’t like it yikes! I don’t like the smell neither. I’ll stick to deva curl super cream styler. I have type 3 a -3 b Spanish girl curls. I also have sensitiv skin so it made me a bit itchy.
"
"
It works well. Smells like sunscreen from the dollar store. If you like that scent,  you'll enjoy this. Otherwise...hold your nose until your hair dries.
"
"
I like the scent ok. The product didn’t do good for my hair I gave it to someone that could use it. When I used it and after my hair dried It looks as if my hair was dirty
"
"
This stuff is so great at making the frizz stay away!!
"
"
Got a great deal and the packaging was perfectly intact. Love this product as it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling in my hair. Everyone always comments on how fresh my hair always smells.
"
"
Wish the bottle had more product! Smells awesome (herbal, not fruity)
"
"
I like this product.  I use it in combination with diva curl cream.
"
"
Of all Deva gels, this is the best one for my hair. Light, you can't even tell you are wearing gel. No cast at all. Smells great too!Downside: no 32oz bottles...
"
"
It is such a bad product!! I applied B'leave-in curl plumper to my wet hair, let it dry, I comb, I get all these white things on my hair which makes my hair more frizzy and tangled! I hate it! Seriously, I would advise not to buy this product! It is a pure waste of money.
"
"
There's a big crack on the tube at the top, and all the gel is poured out! Besides The gel will spoil because of the hole in the tube!
"
"
It didn't work for my curls. Ended up returning it after one use.
"
"
Best Product for dry curly hair . This is my miracle leave in . My hair is dry & damaged . But this gives me beautiful bouncy curls .
"
"
This product works great afyer wearing the deva curl cream i put this one and gives me better results than if i apply it first!
"
"
I love this product, my curls come out beautifully after I apply a small amount,  towel dry then diffuse dry ! My curls are curly and not frizzy ! Amazing product !
"
"
It really helps hold the curl in my hair. It has a mild pleasant scent.
"
"
Am in love with this product. It smell good amd feel good in your hair make your curls pop.  Love love
"
"
Did give me volume, but also made hair tangly.  Sent it back.
"
"
Very sticky, hair went frizzy after all
"
"
Excellent for defining and plumping curls.  I use it as a leave in and layer it with Knot Today and Argan oil.  It’s more of a styler. I seal everything in with the ultra defining gel by deva curl.
"
"
I cannot state how this products works because fornsime idd reason the bottle itself had a slash and the prouduct was everywhere in the little bag it cane in
"
"
Used this product for over a year. What I didn’t know was that my hair shaft was not receiving much moisture. I am Afro Latina. Lots of curls and my hair is thick. My hair is defined as high porosity. Lot of moisture needed.
"
"
This product has been a game changer for my hair. I have fine, spiral curls and now they are bouncy and defined. I still use a curl cream along side this. But this is a must add to hair care
"
"
This stuff did a decent job taming my curls but gave me the worst white flakes I've ever seen. I'm at work today and I'm holed up in my office because I'm wearing a black jacket with white flakes all down my back. Embarrassing.
"
"
A must have!  Since I switched to the DevaCurl products (and have purchased many of them), I have never NOT used B'Leave-in, because they tell me it is necessary.
"
"
Smells bad, no hold, disappointed
"
"
The curl boosting spray gel hold your curls longer even when you untwist your hair out. But you still need to use another hair product-a hair mist to keep it in place because that spray gel hold your hair real tight. The curl pumper is a great for natural, perm, and kinky hair what suits with your curling styles.
"
"
This is a great product. It is my favorite hair product!
"
"
Not one of their best products
"
"
I love this product! It is a great base for other products. It's slippery feel gives your curls hydration without the crunchy feeling. It also does not flake! I love how it gives my curls a bounce without frizz. It looks really good when you diffuse and also if you air dry.
"
"
Perfect! My curls shine and are unbelievably soft and amazing!  I will always buy this one 👌🏽 Smell isn’t a “blow you away” type but it’s still refreshing!
"
"
This product does give me nice bouncy curls, but it also leaves me with white flakes in my hair all over and I made sure to use it wet and or damp. I will not be purchasing this again, it’s embarrassing walking around with white flakes in my hair.
"
"
Even with minimal use (maybe a pea amount ) it made my hair SUPER crunchy as if I used moose.
"
"
It’s great, but devacurl is always so expensive. I love the product, I just wish it wasn’t so costly.
"
"
My product came with a sticky residue on the outside with long dark hairs stuck to it. It also didn’t had a seal or anything on the inside to assure me if wasn’t a returned product. Gross.
"
"
It doesn't work for me
"
"
My curly hair is thinning at the crown. This product not only holds the curl, but it helps give my hair a thicker appearance.  Smells great.
"
"
This is not for me
"
"
Dont think its great for the price but it doesn't leave a residue of any kind, and does its job well.
"
"
So I started using some DevaCurl products for the first time and they are wonderful.  It is true that most products weigh down your hair. This makes my hair curly and bouncy.
"
"
This didn't dry my hair out like most DC products I've used, but it didn't seem to do much of anything either. If I used too much of it my hair became pretty stringy.
"
"
Love it also it thing my hair is a little too kinky for the product but it provides great hold and gives waves when I wear my hair upswept
"
"
Love my hair now
"
"
Great for curls
"
"
I love this brand for my daughters curly hair. But this one was not a good choice. She hates the small, and it leaves a white residue on her hair.
"
"
This is a personal problem for me. This product made my scalp itch and I didn’t receive the volume I was looking for.
"
"
I woukd recommend this and the gel together. Works great for my suoer curly hair
"
"
Don't know why people are so obsessed with this stuff. Just seemed to weigh my curls down.
"
"
Love it when my hair is frizzy
"
"
Smells like a perm and didn't c any results.
"
"
This is a terrible product. It leaves a white film residue all over hair.
"
"
Te deja los risos perfecto lo recomiendo
"
"
I love this product, it's the only product I 've tried that actually does what it claims for my naturally curly hair!
"
"
Product leaves your hair dry and brittle. Not a very nice product.
"
"
My review will be on the item itself being purchased through amazon vs devacurl website or local store such as ULTA. This is the exact same product for such a great price! Bring my curls to life!
"
"
Great for my hair
"
"
Don’t like it. Makes my hair dry
"
"
Good product to use if you want to accentuate your curls.  I did not find this product to be moisturizing.  If that is what you are after, I recommend using this with another product that focuses more on that.
"
"
Crazy about it! My curls loved it!
"
"
This DevaCurl gel has made sores and scales on my head.  Also it is making my hair fall out.  I would NOT recommend it to anyone.  I have stopped using this product!  Read the reviews on FB., not good.
"
"
Love this product!!  Makes my curls perfect!
"
"
Love the look, the smell, and the curls! Highly recommend!
"
"
This does not leave my hair feeling sticky or crunchy. It defines my curls and smells great.
"
"
Love everything about itSaw it on YouTube a few times and I’m never going back
"
"
This is terrible. It really is watered down and the product inside is not devacurl. This is not ok. It leaves my hair with white flakes, dry, and frizzy. I'm really disappointed. I went to Ulta to compare the products and they're not the same.
"
"
Destroyed my hair
"
"
Love this product leaves my hair feeling smooth and the product is light which is great!
"
"
Priced just right!
"
"
This is one of the best leave in curl boosters I’ve tried. It left my curls hydrated and easily styleable. DivaCurl is the best in the business for curly hair.
"
"
This curl maker smells really light and helps my hair get defined.
"
"
I use this gel daily there’s never buildup and it’s never sticky
"
"
Does a great job setting my curls when damp!  Really like this product.
"
"
This product is horrible!!!! Leaves my hair feeling like hay. Followed the instructions to a T and ended up looking like broom of a witch. If I could rate it 0 I would.
"
"
Did not work my type of hair.
"
"
Love this product. Part of my curly girl hair routine
"
"
Just what I wanted
"
"
Great product
"
"
I love DevaCurl products!! It definitely works and brings out my curls even more, that’s why it’s called “The Curl Plumper”!!
"
"
Don't think this is real does not smell right
"
"
I liked the definition and taming it did on my curly and wavy hair, but even just using a tiny bit of the product there is a lot of residual build up that flakes out.
"
"
For me this is just ok. Nothing special. I hate the smell too.
"
"
Best volumizer ever!! This stuff is magical.
"
"
I no longer like DevaCurl products. My hair has been shedding way too much from the time I used DevaCurl.
"
"
Ok product
"
"
Leaves hair seed soft
"
"
The smell is not right. It’s almost as if it’s expired. Leaves hair crunchy.
"
"
I love everything devacurl! My hair has always been so unmanageable. But since discovering Deva cuts and devacul products, I dont have that problem. Just gorgeous ringlets curl. This particular product is a great finish to my shower hair routine.
"
"
love deva curl products
"
"
Love the DevaCurl products.  They really do help your natural curl to be more defined.
"
"
This product has put manageability into my curly hair, leaves my curls soft, bouncy and defined without crunchiness or stiffness.  I'm so very pleased with Deva curl! Thanks so much!
"
"
Usually DivaCurl products are great, but this smelt odd (like a ton of chemicals) and weighed down my curls. I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't actually the real deal.
"
"
Worked well but not last long
"
"
Good quality
"
"
I have mostly wavy hair but this product really helps define my curls from the root! I love it.
"
"
Did not like product
"
"
Definitely a great product and a great size to take with me on my many travels.
"
"
lots of flakes. :(
"
"
Product EVERYWHERE. Pump was broken and the product was leaking all over the plastic when i tried to open it.  I wasn’t even able to cut through all of the plastic as i was getting the bLeavn all over my hands . Total mess
"
"
Do not use, you will suffer from hair loss
"
"
Works great on my 2b-2c curls. Curls are defined
"
"
The product was sticky (gel like) and did not help with frizz and creating nice curls. Very disappointed.
"
"
Me gustan las curvas, no me gusta el olor.
"
"
Smells wonderful & lightly holds curls perfectly. My 5 year old even liked the smell.
"
"
Great product and seemed to make my hair seem even curlier.
"
"
My favorite DevaCurl products!!  I also love the size.
"
"
Muy buen producto
"
"
Love it
"
"
Does an amazing job with curls, but tends to dry out hair and stinks something awful.
"
"
No hold
"
"
Great for curls
"
"
You half to try this it makes your curls so much fuller and its my favorite now i cant live without it!!!!
"
"
Such a great product! I apply it in the shower... love it!
"
"
I am so disappointed with his brother I had high expectations when you leave my hair literally white
"
"
Nice for curly hair and firm hold but at times does leave a little residue of white stuff in your hair.
"
"
Love love love
"
"
I love this product! It gives my curls extra bounce and volume. I've already repurchased and will continue to purchase this product!
"
"
This is a scam! I don’t think it’s the real DevaCurl product. This made my scalp dry & itchy, it left flakes all over my hair, and I’ve noticed some thinning since using this. I wouldn’t waste my money on this.
"
"
I absolutely love this for my curls! It makes my curls look amazing. 🤩👌 me and my brother are the only ones with curly hair and it makes our hair look outstanding! You need to get on this sis!
"
"
Fair
"
"
Awesome product. Even if you have 3c curls (I’m 3c), you NEED this product.
"
"
This works really good on my sons hair
"
"
Just started using this product on top of my deva one conditioner that I leave in. So good so far.
"
"
I love it and my hair too ❤️
"
"
Works great.
"
"
Great product
"
"
This is my 2nd MUST to go product for my 2C 3A curly hair. Very little needed at a time therefore product should last you awhile. Quarter size for shoulder length hair.
"
"
This is my favorite.  Very light doesn’t weigh hair or curls down.
"
"
Still have frizz
"
"
Just as expected, love it!
"
"
This product used in between washes, just a little on dampened hair, rejuvenates my curls and adds definition! Loving it!
"
"
GREAT PRODUCT
"
"
Excelente
"
"
Work for me, my curls are great
"
"
I have 4C hair and I find Deva Curl products the best ever. I’ve tried all those commercial stuff from the store and none worked as good as deva curl
"
"
Smells horrible, but great for creating lots of curls.
"
"
It's the only product that works on my curls.  Leaves my hair non firzzy, and soft.  I call it the miracle for stubborn curly hair like mine :)
"
"
OK
"
"
Love this makes my hair super curly!
"
"
I just love this gel on my curly hair
"
"
Textura increíble, deja el pelo súper suave
"
"
Too heavy. Left my hair SO LIMP! Sisters hair looks good but she’s curly.
"
"
This does not make your hair stiff and ""crunchy""
"
"
I honestly love this product!! It helps my curls soo much! It came on time ! & it was exactly what I wanted ! For all my curly hair people out there this is the product to get!
"
"
Devacurl does it again!  This amazing product leaves me hair full of bounce and curl.  I receive many compliments on my hair since switching to this product.  Highly recommend!
"
"
Ok
"
"
OMG OMG OMG! Going silicone free and this product is the IT!
"
"
Gives my 4c 4a curls a boost. Volume is great when I use this along with the Arc angel gel.
"
"
Wife loves it.
"
"
I normally have wavy/curly hair and this product dried my hair out after trying it twice. My curls fell flat and my hair felt rough overall. Disappointed :(
"
"
Easygoing
"
"
Work well, Yeah only $20 heavy residue,don’t need much. I am very curly. Helps form the courts and define them, without frizz.
"
"
Doesn't seem to add or help my natural curl. Could be that the No-Poo Cleanser Shampoo and Conditioner just make my hair too soft???
"
"
I love how this isn’t heavy on my hair! It also doesn’t leave my hair hard or stiff, a little goes a long way and adds volume
"
"
Dried flakes at the ends of my hair and didn't plump curls
"
"
I didn’t work for my hair texture
"
"
Leaves white flakes in you hair like dandruff.
"
"
Good for my curls love it
"
"
Great product, my curly hair has never looked better!
"
"
Perfect amount of non-sticky hold for my curls.
"
"
This is my favorite hair product!
"
"
Been using this product for years.
"
"
Doesn’t give volume
"
"
Great product!  Didn’t make my hair crunchy but still added curl.
"
"
It's amazing, but don't use too much because your hair will be greasy
"
"
love my deva curl products
"
"
It is very light and gives my curls much more definition.
"
"
I love that it makes my hair appear more curly and fuller!
"
"
Best product for curly hair. Not too heavy does not flake. Provides excellent frizz control.
"
"
Gives fine hair body
"
"
Deva curl really does well with curly hair in general, but it works well In my hair when I apply it to soaking wet hair or my 3rd day hair.
"
"
I really like the added volume
"
"
My 6yo curls looks amazing after this
"
"
Didn't like. I'm not sure if it has any effect
"
"
great
"
"
Good product that holds the curly and soft.
"
"
Me encanta
"
"
I bought the bigger size for the next time. I love all DevaCurl products!
"
"
I’m a new DevaCurl user and this product was recommended to me by my hairdresser.  Great curl definition!
"
"
ami no me funcionó
"
"
Leave my hair super soft, shiny, and lightweight.. smells really good also.. love it !
"
"
The product was very disappointing for me , unfortunately it didn’t work well with the type of my hair
"
"
This product dried out my daughters hair and did not help her curls at all😢just another wasted product in the cabinet.
"
"
Excellent product..... Love it
"
"
My child has extremely curly hair and this product keeps her hair from getting frizzy
"
"
I loved it
"
"
Very nice love it
"
"
Leaves my hair soft not crunchy
"
"
Leaves residue and flakes, my hair ends up white by the end of the day.
"
"
It is amazing!
"
"
Absolutely love this product. It is so moisturising and helps with static during the winter.
"
"
Makes my hair live. Go for it !!
"
"
I don't like that it leaves dry flakes of product in your hair.
"
"
It made my hair crunchy. I don’t really like that it didn’t make my hair plump up like it said it would
"
"
Love this product, I use it with the foam
"
"
Makes my curls look so amazing. Best Deva Curl product out
"
"
Pretty good, works for my curls
"
"
Excelente producto
"
"
I smells good and works Great!
"
"
Great Product my Daughter love it we was looking for the right product and we finally found it
"
"
Very god product for my hair
"
"
Good everyday moisturizer and curl gel.
"
"
Really good product:  I got it based on reviews I’d seen on YouTube and was not disappointed.
"
"
Helps assure that I have great curls whether I diffuse or plop and air dry!
"
"
Left my hair soft and gave it amazing volume 😄
"
"
Love this stuff! All deva curl products are great
"
"
Excellent product for curls, not sticky, produces soft, defined curls
"
"
Excelente
"
"
Me encanto el producto te deja el pelo suave y es el que comienza a definir un poco los rizos. Me encanto!
"
"
Waste of money
"
"
I really like this product only issue is I have curly hair (3a type) and if you use it more than twice after your wash day, residue will buildup and flakes will appear on the hair and scalp. It does say leave in so be warned but it makes my curly defined and moistured. I recommend using a styling cream or mousse alongside for more definition and volume.
"
"
👍
"
"
Love the product  can’t wait to try everything from deva curls
"
"
This product gave me amazing frizz-free curls.
"
"
Very good product for curly hair
"
"
Curl definition is amazing!
"
"
Not the real product! More gel/alcohol based than the actual product. I put them side by side on a few occasions
"
"
This product really works well for me.
"
"
Reasonable priced and fast delivery. Love how it makes my hair feel.
"
"
Supposed to plump your curls not weigh them down!!! Uuuugh
"
"
Love this hair product a lot and it’s very gentle to my curls.
"
"
It’s great on day one. But the residue on the next few days was a let down.
"
"
Love the product
"
"
Pretty good
"
"
This product was ok...held most of my curls. But still has some frizz.
"
"
Not happy at all !
"
"
It works best when hair is completely wet.
"
"
First time using and was not disappointed worked great
"
"
It makes your hair soft not sticky like most gels do
"
"
Performance is exactly as described
"
"
my fav!!
"
"
Stinks!
"
"
I got really good at definition
"
"
Na
"
"
Love this stuff
"
"
Makes the best curls in my grandsons hair
"
"
Great product !  Defines and holds curls
"
"
Makes my hIr super frizzy
"
"
Leaves hair shiny and keeps curls without the crunch
"
"
Love that I added this product into my hair routine.
"
"
It was ok
"
"
Great product!  Leaves curls soft and bouncy
"
"
Hasta el momento complacida con este producto.
"
"
In overall good product that I will buy again
"

"
"
i loved the smell and how it is non sticky
"
"
made my hair curlers but the pump broke, that's why I gave it 4/5 stars.

This product it amazing. It smells so good.

I am bi-racial and it's hard to find natural products that will maintain the moisture of my heair without the weight. This product does all of that and more. not to mention it smells just as great as it works. I never understood they hype behind DevaCurl products, but I'm b'leavin it now....pun intended!
"
"
Worst deva product I tried..... make my hair stringy and dropped all my curls. Terrible.
"
"
I use this DevaCurl product a lot because it does enhance curls. Glad it's finally in a larger container.
"
"
LOVE this stuff and great price! Hair is very curly but not super thick. Works amazingly with One Condition to control frizz!
"
"
Works well for my curls
"
"
Believe bad hair reviews on YouTube. They are true
"
"
This is a great styling produvpct when Inwant to wear my hair curly.
"
"
Arrived frozen solid couldn't use it
"
"
OMG my hair loves this product.  If you use it correctly it really will improve your curl volume.  If you use it incorrectly...well you're an idiot.  Follow the instructions!
"

Love this product.

I used DevaCurl coconut styling cream, then DC light styling gel, then my trusty FrizzEase serum, and finished with DC B-Leave in Conditioner. A lot of products, I know. I prob don’t need them all, but was just playing with making the right “cocktail” of products that work for me. Then I “plopped” my hair in a tee shirt for 30 min. The results were very pretty, defined curls! I like the B-Leave in conditioner very much. However, I discovered that if you are trying to revive your curls a second day, wetting your hair and using this in the ends will give you crispy curls.  You can always crunch them when they are dry, but they feel a little gunky. I prob used too much!
"
"
I have long, baby fine, curly hair. This product actually takes the curl right out of my hair. too greasy and slick feeling for me. Hair looked limp and flat. Provides zero volume, at least for me. Hope others have a better experience.
"
"
Honestly I wanted to live deva curl but it honestly does not do much for my hair I have 3c/4a and I find the stuff to not work so well on courser hair I see pictures of girls here with wavy hair textures and their hair looks great but it’s just another product to me marketed for “wavy” hair not so much curly hair and the price is just way to high for the amount of product that your getting
"
"
Product does exactly as advertised and is perfect for curly hair.  Haven't found one any better!
"
"
I love this product for my hair. It gives my hair a lot of life and bounce. It's very lightweight on my hair and allows my hair to stay soft. I have recommended this to 4 people already who also bought it and love it!
"
"
Wow! I normally don’t use hair products, but this one makes a HUGE difference in my hair. My curls hold for 3ish days now and they are so defined. Just make sure to apply to soaking wet hair and either diffuse or air dry. I don’t own a hair dryer, so I just air dry! I would recommend this to curly headed people everywhere.
"
"
I was very optimistic when I first purchased this product because many people just love this brand.  Unfortunately, this did not work for my hair at all.  It leaves it looking dry and frizzy.  I tried a much cheaper alternative brand, Cantu, and it was a completely different experience.  Love the Cantu products.  I don't think Deva products are bad, but be aware that they will not work for all hair types.  Before you buy it, if you can sample it somehow, it might save you a lot of money.
"
"
I recently switched to DevaCurl Leave-In and guuuuuuuuuurl let me tell you! My hair just feels more moisturized, softer overall, and amazingly healthier. This leave in is thinner in consistency and goes on a little ""soapy looking"", which worried me at first, but the end result is amazing. This thing is amazing!
"
"
Works well for 3b hair. A little too thick for 2C.
"
"
I am not big on styling products - most of them dry out your hair and weigh it down or make it feel crunchy. Not to mention, most of them require time and effort to use correctly. This product is like nothing else. Fast and easy to use and even moisturizes your hair!While your hair is still sopping wet, apply a big handful throughout your hair and scrunch. Then gently scrunch with a microfiber towel... Annnnnd, you're done. Do not comb. Do not blowdry. Do not wrap in a turban. Just let your air dry and it defines your waves or curls and eliminates the vast majority of frizz.I know a lot of girls use a bunch more products and diffuse and the like - but I find all that completely unnecessary. I dig the wild, untamed look - just not the frizz and tangles that usually went with it. Poof, this made them both go away. And it defined my waves in a way I didn't even think was possible. Some of my 2B locks started to form straight up ringlets.
"
"
I know that some people don't like the smell of this product.  It does have a scent, but I do not find it offensive.  Even so, the scent goes away or becomes unnoticeable after a few hours.  I like that it leaves the hair soft, NOT crunchy, almost as if you have nothing on your hair at all.  My curl type is frizzy but loose, S-shaped waves, which Deva calls 'swavy'.  I combine this product with a bit of the Deva curling lotion, applied to wet but not soaking hair.  For second or third day, you can just rake through a bit of water with hands, to refresh the curl.
"
"
I bought this to add moisture, complete waste of money.  Applied it to soaking wet hair followed up with Arc Angel gel. I have thick, low porosity hair. It made my hair crunchy and dry:^( I chatted with a devacurl rep. about the product. I learned this product is best for 3a-3c and for volume. Supercream with ultra gel is better for 4c hair.
"
"
I have wavy curly shoulder length hair (2C,3A?). I mix this in with ArcAngel 4 pumps each and i definitely get some curl boost, but nothing like moptop's curl enhancer ! 3 stars because ive used better and also this product sometimes leaves residue when i go back for more on day 2 or 3 hair.
"
"
I've used this product (and many other DevaCurl products) and I love it. It arrived with the nozzle in the open position, though. So a good deal of the product had wasted inside the plastic packaging that it was in. I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon or the seller to advise of the problem. Maybe I missed it, but it wasnt an option in my ""Orders"" tab. Anyway, great product, bad packaging from the seller :-\
"
"
I switched from DevaCurl's Defining gel to this and I'm happy that I did. I have fine hair that is very curly...but without the right product, it just looks crazy and frizzy. This product definitely helps to define the individual curls. I put it on my wet hair and then partially dry with blowdryer while holding my head upside down, and crunching the curls. It can dry a little crunchy but it softens up after I scrunch up the dry curls with my fingers. Love this product!
"
"
Yesterday I was gonna give this product 2 stars since my hair was shiny and had volume. But by the end of the day my shine was gone and this morning my hair was sooooo dry and crunchy. So this product only get one star for volume but volume is not cute when your hair is a big dry mess. The worst part about this product is that it leaves a horrible white residue. Looks like I walked outdoors in snow.
"
"
My new holy grail product. I am Caucasian and have 2B/2C hair. I struggle getting any volume out of it, because it is pretty fine. The result is usually a somewhat limp, curly mess. I used quite a generous amount of this, but this only (to test it out), and it worked so well that my husband commented on my hair two days in a row! As any married woman can attest, this says a lot! 😂 I just put about a quarter size in am doing let it air dry, and voila! I’m done. No more using 3 products. This seems to actually help my hair dry faster too, for some reason.
"
"
This product exceeded my expectations! I read lots of reviews and figured I would give it a try but really expected it to be another product that would over promise and under deliver.  I have very frizzy  curly hair. I typically have to flat iron my hair to keep it under control. This product allowed me enjoy my natural hair and feel good about my appearance. My husband even told me my curls made me look younger :)  Highly recommend! Will  order other products in this line. My only minor complaint is the smell...not my favorite but it goes away quickly.
"
"
Love this on all of my kids' hair. I have 4 biracial children with a range of soft curls to thick course kinky curls. It works well on all of them. It has great slip. I use Deva Curl One Conditioner, and then rinse and apply this product, and the results are amazing!
"
"
Amazing Deva product. Works like gel to hold your hair in place but doesn't leave it crispy at all. Hair feels smooth like a cream styling product
"
"
I really liked it a lot! I'm still trying to find the right combo for my curly hair. Just makes my hair feel sticky and dry on the 2nd day... maybe I'm using too much?
"
"
My hair loves protein so this has been instrumental in defining my curls. I use it with the ultra defining gel, since it's not something that I can use just on its own. I only need a dime size amount for my hair, so I definitely see this lasting me a while. Make sure that you figure out how to use it with your hair type. It took me a week to figure the proper amount and application method to get it to work for me.
"
"
I tried DevaCurl because of the reviews.  Unfortunately it didn't work on my hair, it just made it a frizzy, crunchy mess.  I used the whole bottle, thinking my hair needed time to adjust, but it didn't get better.  I do not this is a good value for the price as I need to use more product due to the length and thickness of my hair.  Not worth it to give it another try.
"
"
I was confused between getting this B'leave or Wave Maker so I tried both. B'leave makes my curls really shiny and plump but doesn't define or encourage new waves. The wave maker doesn't make the hair so shiny but does define and bring out curls. I'll use the B'leave when I want looser, shinier hair and the wave maker when I want to be curlier.
"
"
I get my hair cut with a DevaCu Cut. Hair is cut dry in curl families, not pulled out in sections.  Then I use this and another Deva Curl product on washed, super wet hair and let dry. You scrunch the wet hair firmly. You can use a few clips near scalp to to add height while drying. When dry, remove and flip gingerly with a puck.
"
"
After using the leave-in conditioner, I used the curl pumper and then wrapped my hair in a tee shirt for about 10 minutes. My curls were better defined and not frizzy. I use this product with 2 other deva-curl products for the ""full"" effect. I've gotten several compliments that my hair looks very nice (when I use these products).
"
"
I have medium-fine hair that curls if you sweet-talk it. Otherwise it’s a frizzy mess. This stuff makes my hair look and feel better than anything else that I’ve tried, including DevaCurl strong hold gel. My hair goes from straight in some parts and wavy in others to full body spiral curls, with the help of a diffuser of course.
"
"
Really love this stuff! I've started using the full DevaCurl lineup after learning about how regular shampoo/products aren't good for your hair. I use this after the shower and lightly towel dry but still damp. It helps keep and define my curls which throughout the day tend to go flat and frizzy. I also highly recommend getting the No-Poo and One Condition shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
I have wavy hair that is thin and doesn't have a true ""style"" to it. This product keeps the frizz to a minimum and adds volume and body. The best part, I don't need to add more product on the second day. Just mist a little water and go!
"
"
When this product ran out I ordered from Ulta as I was not happy with the quality of my hair. Now using the one from Ulta my hair looks much better and it doesn't get fuzzy after the first day. My husband noticed a change after a week and suggests I buy from Ulta from now on. If you don't like how the product is working try ordering from a verified dealer before quitting B'Leave in all together.
"
"
If you have 3c hair like me, this will change your life. Clear leave in so NO white cast or residue. Defines curls like crazy! No crunch or hardness. Just shine, Moisture, and definition! You’ll literally thank the heavens for bottling up a piece of itself and sending it down to us curlies! The 16 oz will be the greatest choice as I first bought the 6 or 8 oz squeeze bottle from Sephora and ran out in less than 2 weeks bc it was ADDICTIVE and didn’t cause product build up(also I’m heavy on the product) but I had to get a bigger size and if they have a BIGGER one I’ll be purchasing that as well.
"
"
This is truly a miracle curl plumper. My hair is naturally curler, but I have mixed hair, which means some parts are straighter than others. This curls all my curls. It gives my coloured hair shine and moisture which is why I ordered it. Don't waste money buying tons of other products. This does the trick!
"
"
Must have for anyone with wavy, curly and super curly hair! It pairs well with mirror curls and light defining gel, after using the no poo shampoo and conditioner!
"
"
I bought this product because they sell it at my son’s hair salon, so thought it must be very good? This product is nice when you put it on, only when dried up it leaves a white residue on my boy ‘s hair.. it doesnt stay hydrated and looks dry with white flakes.. not satisfied for that price at all
"
"
I fell in love with Deva Curl the first time I used it. I used this and the No-poo and One Conditioner. Within 1 month I had lost half my hair. I did some research and found out that this has become a common issued for Deva Curl. There is even a Facebook support group. I'll never use these products again.
"
"
I've only used this a few times, but so far so good. I have really frizzy curly hair and it needs a lot of moisturizing. I think I need to use it a few more times before I can be completely sure, but like I said so far so good. I will update after I've used it for a while. I'm a big fan of the devacurl products so my hopes are up.
"
"
I was a bit hesitant to buy online as I know Deva Curl doesn't authorize Amazon to sell this product.  However, it worked great and had my hair has not suffered any ill side effects.  Curls my hair nicely without weighing it down.  Must use a gel or something with it though. It is not mean to use alone.
"
"
My hair had lost some of the curl from my younger years and I wanted to try to revive it. I had tried a number of mousses and gels with mixed success. This stuff is amazing. I love my bouncy natural curls!
"
"
Deva Curl is expensive for what you get!!! I mean expensive!!! This didn't do anything to enhance my curls at all and is still sitting in the cupboard after 2 uses!!! I bought the shampoo and condition as well and MEH....nothing special.  Don't waste your money JMO
"
"
DevaCurl products speak for themselves! I've never tried a DevaCurl product that didn't do its job. This one doesn't disappoint. I have 2 daughters with tight coily curly hair and I wouldn't be able to manage their hair without all my DevaCurl products, especially this B'leave In
"
"
This product doesn't do much on its own and does not have enough hold for my fine 3a curls. But, when I mix it with gel or a cream that has more hold then I get better results. I'll keep using it but not sure if I will reorder.
"
"
This is not DevaCurl B'leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper. It is a knock off. I have purchased this exact product for 5 years from Ulta and thought I would save a dime buying it from amazon... Big mistake. It dried my hair terribly. I knew after using it the first time. it even smells different.  Buyer Beware!
"
"
My wife loves this product. She feels “more curlier then ever.” The smell is great and leaves her hair soft, springy, and touchable.
"
"
I got a sample of Deva curls cream as a sample. I fell in love with the way my curls looked. Is the only product that's good for my hair. My hair is more wavy then curly. I wish it was curly so I have to use product on my hair.
"
"
Just washed my hair this morning, then added product. It left a super flakie film in my hair.  Super disappointed.
"
"
I wish I had tried Tigi Bed Head products for curly hair before buying this. My daughter has curly hair and I’m trying to learn how to style it without frizz and keeping her curls in tact. This brand didn’t work but Tigi products are changing the game for us.
"
"
Not my favorite Deva Curls product. I typically can use one product and get away with defined curls and volume. This product weighed my curls down and did not give me the volume I wanted. I may try pairing it with a form styler or with a gel to get better results. Improbably will not purchase again.
"
"
This gel is intensely watery and is intended to be a curl activator. A major problem I have with DevaCurl products is their insistence on watering everything down... what am I paying for!? I tried this a few different times... it literally does nothing.
"
"
I use a lot of Deva curl products.  I mix this with the curl defining gel.  it does exactly what it promises.  My hairdresser actually asked me if my hair was getting curlier. This stuff is the best!
"
"
This stuff really makes your curls come alive! I really HATE using so much product in my hair so at the recommendation of my stylist, I gave it a try and oh gee oh my, by golly it works! If you have stubborn curls, B'Leave-In can revitalize them.
"
"
I read some reviews before buying this product.I must say I LOVE IT!Texture is great, it does not make my hair sticky, greasy.My hair looks beautiful and my curls are perfect!I highly recommend this.
"
"
This leaves a great crisp cast on the hair but flakes once touched. Not worth it for me. I also purchased another brand for $3 and it works better than theses far as the flaking goes. I think the hype is not true to the way the product works.
"
"
There is something black growing inside and I believe it’s mold. Yuck!!! It worked great, but gee whiz that stuff is expensive to now be growing black mold in it.
"
"
I really like it when I first used it. Unfortunately my hair is extremely protein sensitive. One high protein product and it takes me weeks to undo the damage. If your hair craves protein, try this.
"
"
I got this product because I tried one of their curl hair masks and loved what it did for my curls. This product however, was not great at all. Didn’t do anything for my hair and left a strange texture to it.
"
"
Love deva curl products but this one seems to dry out my fine curly hair.  It may work better for coarser hair.  The wave maker is a better fit for my hair
"
"
I didn't get any added moisture and it left my hair feeling like there was product in it. It did help hold some curl and there really was not a scent.
"
"
I love this product.  I have curly hair that is prone to frizzing.  I use B’Leavin, followed by Ultra Defining gel and my hair loves both products.  I was pleased to get this larger bottle with a pump as it is easier to apply.
"
"
This product dried my hair out more than it already was. I used it in conjunction with other Devacurl products and did not get good results.  The cream is the best product in the line.
"
"
Love this product and I'm not the biggest Devacurl fan. Great for plumping curls.
"
"
meh... leaves my hair crunchy and have to use half the bottle to style my hair
"
"
I thought this was more of a leave in cream. It's gel. I don't like the hard crunchy look so it's not for me.
"
"
Absolutely love this product. I have very thick, natural curls. I have had a hard time finding a product that works well for me and this is one of my new favorites
"
"
Makes beautiful curls. The only downfall is some white residual stuff it leaves in the hair after a while of having it on. I have to mask it with somw water and moving the hair around.
"
"
Love love love the curls. Got quite a few compliments on how beautiful my curls were.
"
"
Love this stuff I use it in addition to my other curling product after washing. If it’s not wash day I spray my hair down with water and put a little bit more of this in and voila.. I’m gorgeous!!
"
"
The only thing I don't like about this product is if you use to much it will leave flakes in your hair. Other then that I love everything else about this product
"
"
I've tried many, many curling products and this one is THE it product.  FINALLY!
"
"
I love this product! My curls look so cute every time I use DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper! It leaves your hair so nice and soft, non oily or sticky feeling.
"
"
I honestly didn’t like this product. It doesn’t smell that great, it makes your hair sticky and doesn’t help with curls. Not worth buying.
"
"
Love this product for my curly hair. A little goes a long way. Not sticky.
"
"
Expensive product that made my long curly hair frizzy.
"
"
Great product. For my hair a little goes a long way. It can leave it feeling kinda grimy for lack of a better term. But hence the plumper and texture.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair between 3A-3B and this product is a great leave in.  I use it when my hair is sopping wet and then style as usual.  Loving the DevaCurl products!!!!
"
"
I love all the Deva curl products. This one adds extra body and curl to my hair. I use it with the light gel. Make sure your hair is very wet when you apply.
"
"
I had high hopes for this product and unfortunately it did not work for my hair. Also it had a funny smell almost like it is burnt.
"
"
It's the best product so far.  Too bad  DevaCurl does not advertise - I learned about the product by accident.  Living in Florida, I always had frizz - with DevaCurl NO MORE FRIZZ.
"
"
This products works great on my natural curly hair I will buy more
"
"
expensive but S/O likes it
"
"
It's not heavy or sticky for my shoulder length, fine hair but adds volumn
"
"
Didn’t like it that much, it makes my hair heavy and weird.
"
"
Best product I’ve ever used on my curls. Way less frizz, way more curl definition.
"
"
Good for my hair
"
"
More like a gel than a moisturizer. Not what I expected at all
"
"
Under testing
"
"
Nice product by a good brand....but I still prefer the lotion type Deva Curl
"
"
it doesn't have a good hold or keep the scrunch frizz free
"
"
Makes some amazing curls
"
"
Cake up Into white flakes
"
"
Left my curls touchably soft and frizz-free. Will definitely add this as part of my permanent lineup!
"
"
If you have curls and need to control them.  You need Deva Curl. products  And Amazon has the best prices!
"
"
I liked it no better than other than less expensive products.  I felt I retained less curl day two with this product.
"
"
I love this! I let my friend borrow it that's how much I liked it. Makes my hair super curly.
"
"
Helps my flat thin hair look not so flat and thin.
"
"
I enjoy using this product causer it works.
"
"
This product leaves flaky residue on hair and clothes, do not recommend.
"
"
Gives volume to my curls but too oily
"
"
Very good
"
"
Love love love this product!!! It has made my hair so much more full and curly!! I separate my hair into 3 sections and rub it in all the way to the ends.
"
"
Bottom was broke open. Product was all over the inside of packing. Could not salvage any of it. Super bummed out
"
"
Use after every wash
"
"
I like it a lot! Give me a lot of volume to my hair.
"
"
Hard to find in my area.
"
"
Love this product. My hair is very fine and everything weighs it down. This softens my stringy hair and makes it look thicker.
"
"
Really helped my hair curl
"
"
Half the price my wife paid at the salon.
"
"
Works well with the rest of the line
"
"
Love DevaCurl products they make my hair look amazing!!! Would buy again!  well packaged
"
"
It smells really good, however it didn’t serve its purpose.
"
"
LOVE it and really love 99% of DevaCurl hair products!
"
"
Makes my curls a million times curlier.
"
"
makes my curls look better, use it with the gel and i love my curls again.  pricey but worth it
"
"
Really works for my frizzy thin hair. It allows me to style and sculpt as needed.
"
"
Love my Deva Curl. Everything they make is awesome.
"
"
I don’t know , it doesn’t feel like the ones from devacurl company.
"
"
not as described, do not waste your money. i try to return , can not,.
"
"
Love
"
"
Didnt do anything for my hair.
"
"
it makes my hair rally dried
"
"
I was using the supercream, which I liked...but it was a bit pricey for me. So far I'm really liking this! Its smooth, light, and  moisturizing. This is all I need after a no poo and the decadence conditioner.UPDATE: I returned the item because it started flaking later in the day. I tried it multiple times before I decided to return it. I was pretty upset because I really like the way it made my hair look shortly after I applied it, but it’s NOT COOL to see little white things floating in the air every time you move yout head and have your black shirt covered in it. Three stars because it might have been a bad batch...
"
"
Works so good on frizzy hair
"
"
Great product
"
"
Works as described
"
"
Curly hair perfection
"
"
Made my hair so dry. I couldn't brush it even after  washing my hair
"
"
great product
"
"
I love this b’leave in
"
"
💞💞💞💞💞
"
"
The product is fine. It was shipped in an oversized box
"
"
Used this on my graying very curly hair.
"
"
This stuff made a believer out of me!!! It does exactly what it says it will do.!
"
"
Exactly what I wanted.
"
"
Product flaked I didn't like it at all
"
"
It leaves my hair defined, moisturized and soft.  Love this product!
"
"
I'm a self-admitted product junkie and I love  experimenting with different products for curly hair. While this does give your curls a bit of shine, it provides absolutely no volume as it claims. Garnier Fructis does the exact same thing as this at a fraction of the cost. I'll use this until it's gone but I won't be buying it again.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Not good for me
"
"
Excellent product!  Love it!
"
"
Great soft hold for my slightly curly hair.
"
"
Leaves a white recidue
"
"
Love this product! Use it every day!
"
"
I loveeee this product! I have really fine curly hair. So I have nice looking curls with no volume on top which is terribly annoying. I use this on my hair first, then followed by the rest of my products, then diffuse and it gets nice lift. Air dry almost does the same effect. I recommend a bigger bottle like this one, so you can maximize the use compared to the cost of it.
"
"
It would be good for other hair types and everyone seems to love this product. I have 3b hair and it just doesn't work for me. I have to use SO much that it leave streaks in my hair when it dries and even then it doesn't give me enough hold to define properly. Arch angel was too heavy so I'm hoping the ultra define will  be a good middle ground.
"
"
I am not a fan of the smell. Make sure you only use a little bit and only at the ends of your hair. If it gets on the base of your hair the top of your head turns shiny and chrispy looking! I guess it helps when I scrunch my hair but I wouldnt say this product is amazing or really makes a big difference.
"
"
Nice shine, great smell! Conditions - be sure to use it BEFORE gel to reduce product flaking :)
"
"
Don't really like the smell and leaves white residue on my hair.
"
"
LOVE IT  LOVE IT  LOVE IT  LOVE IT.
"
"
Makes my curls defined and voluminous. Love it!!
"
"
Product arrived exploded
"
"
All women who are currently using this hair product in any form, should probably stop using it immediately. If you haven't had a chance to watch or listen to the news today; numerouscustomers that have used this product have claimed that the product causes hair loss, damage to the scalp etc..
"
"
Disappointed with this product on so many levels!1. It completely stripped my hair color! Did the company even bother to test it??? As I was diffusing my hair, I was shocked to see my lowlights had turned orange-y and my highlights were white!! I’ve never experienced this! Shame, shame, shame on you Deva!!!2. It stinks. Reminds me of a public bathroom.3. It left my hair stringy and felt like straw!4. The price. Really?Ugh. Such an awful product!! I just can’t believe these reviews. I used it on soaking wet hair, straight out of the shower, like all my curl products. So, so disappointed!!ZERO STARS!

I bought directly from DevaCurl in a holiday package deal. This is one my least favorite Deva products. For me, it’s not very moisturizing and it doesn’t have enough slip. It felt that it made my hair tangle and generally felt unmanageable.
"
"
It was sealed and a real deva curl product! I love LOVE deva curl and this gives me exactly what it says it does... a lil goes a long way!!!
"
"
I am used to heavier leave-ins. This one is very refreshing. I think it smells great. The product isn't heavy or stick. It gives my curls nice definition.
"
"
My hair is usually wavy but tonight it’s straight up CURLY thank you so much DevaCurl!!!!
"
"
Personally everyone hyped up this product but it doesn't do what I expected. I thought it may give my curls a boost but I don't really use it because it makes them fall a bit. I went back to my original routine, do not fix what isn't broken. Just do what works for you.

--If you found this review helpful, please click ""helpful""--This product makes my curls so bouncy and full of volume. The top generally falls flat but I use this and clip it up (see YouTube tutorial by Deva Curl) and BAM! So much volume!UPDATE:Curly and wavy girls, you need this! This will transform your hair!Thanks to @HiF3licia, I now realize that my curls need lots and lots and lots of moisture, love, and attention. Deva Curl products are all silicone, paraben, and sulfate free; all of those chemicals are awful for curly hair. Since purchasing this item in February (it's not July), my hair has started to transform from frizzy waves to more defined spirals. It's not all the way where I want it YET, but I am sure that with the curly girl method, it will be soon! The pictures attached are in chronological order. With consistent use of DC products, I am starting to see my curls become so beautiful!I do recommend learning how to ""wet plop"" because I find that it helps my hair so much PLUS it gets it out of the way when I'm getting ready. Also, deep condition whenever you shower with shampoo. It sounds like a lot but I just deep condition as I'm washing my body and shaving. The bowl method works wonders, too. I get made fun of by my boyfriend but he loves the results. The bowl method coats each strand of hair equally with product. I found out that most times if a curl is going haywire, it means it didn't get properly coated with product. The bowl method eliminates that and I do notice a big difference.Oh, and a silk pillowcase is your friend, girls!

I have wavy 2b hair that can't handle thicker products because they'll weigh it down. This is perfect. It makes my hair frizz free. Like really, frizz-free. If you've struggled your entire life with frizz, you'll know how much peace this can bring.
"
"
I spent years getting my hair into a very healthy state, only to be destroyed in month. 40% hair loss IN A MONTH using Deva Curl products. I’m devastated. PLEASE stay away from brand, if you value your hair. I can’t stop crying, and feeling where my hair used to be.
"
"
I've always had frizzy hair, which would result in loss of curls haflway through the day. Other anti-frizz products would either weigh my hair down or make it look greasy. This is a great balance and works wonderfully for my thin hair. I put it in right after the gel (L'oreal Evercurl) and my hair looks great and smooth for the whole day. It might be pricier than other products, but it is 100% worth it for me.
"
"
I've been using this for about 2 months. My very curly hair is starting to thin on top, and a volumizer seemed like a good idea. This does the trick, and doesn't leave my hair feeling stiff or ""crunchy."" (Occasionally I find I've used too much and my hair feels a bit stiff, but I just fluff it up with my fingers and the stiffness vanishes.
"
"
This is so far one of the most amazing foams for hair I’ve ever had. It doesn’t weight my hair down at all. I used it in combination with a leave in conditioner and it gives my curls amazing volume and texture. Not crunchy at all.
"
"
I have fine hair but alot of it naturally curly and gray. This does give me nice volume when applied at the roots prior to diffusing.
"

My eldest daughter has screw type ringlets for hair. She has always bemoaned her hair saying it's like straw. We read about curly hair in the ""Curly Girl Handbook"" (?) and devacurl was suggested. We have tried it and our whole family now uses almost all of the product line. My daughter's hair is softer and more manageable. She has thin fine curly vhair so the volumizing foam is perfect!
"
"
Curls 2b/c - anything too heavy weighs down my curls but it NEEDS to be defined and encouraged to curl a bit. It's a battle finding product that I can use since I have REALLY thick hair but light weight enough to keep the curls happy. Moving to FL has been a challenge with the humidity and frizz. This stuff is magic ju-ju. Use on it's own when I'm being lazy. Or as part of my 3 product combo - 1st - wave maker cream 2nd - this volumizing foam and 3rd deva ultra defining gel (not the arc angel - too heavy, makes my hair look greasy) - spray with water and squish each product in layer by layer. Once done, plop in veil net, air dry, then defuse the remaining. Or just straight defuse on low. Good luck curlies!
"
"
Product was half full when arrived. It makes my hair hard & very crunchy even after I “broke the curl caste”. I always have luck with foaming mousse products but unfortunately not with this one.... Really disappointed....

got this mainly for the frizz and I didn't see any results. On the contrary it seemed to dry my hair and make it stiff and scratchy. I think it gives a bit of texture which might look good on certain types of hairs (thin/straight or softly wavy) but not for my thick wavy hair. Wish one could try before he buys.
"
"
Just started using this! I hope it works as good as most users say!I'm loving my curls thanks to DevaCurl! I should seriously make a video of curls before and after devacurl! AMAZING
"
"
Before you purchase this product look into the current class action lawsuit against Deva Curl regarding ALL of their products. Save yourself the  heartache, hair loss and damage. Take 5 min to look on YouTube to see what is happening to other users.
"
"
I absolutely love this product when I buy it in the store. This is my first time buying on amazon and without a doubt there is something wrong with this product. Smells and looks the same but my hair was matted, dry and unmanageable after only two days of use. It also wasn’t filled to the top. I’m wondering if they took a half used product and filled it with some other ingredient to make it appear fuller or something. Not sure what happened here but my hair is very dry and feels horrible. I’m putting a deep conditioner in my hair now and hoping it improves.
"
"
It's just okay. I have thick wavy hair  It makes my hair crunchy and doesn't really do much for volume. I'm better off using gel and clipping my roots for volume.  You can scrunch out the crunch but my hair just looks stringy when I use this. Maybe if have lighter weight hair it would help with volume.
"
"
When reviewing hair products, the most important thing is to specify your hair type. I have curly, for real curly not scrunched, 2c & 3A curls. My hairs is Caucasian and it is not thin but fine. I also have low porosity hair. This product just weight my hair down so much. My curls were dead. It went back.
"
"
I like many Deva products but this is a total fail. This product made my hair sticky, stringy and I didn't get any volume from it.  There are so many other good curly hair products.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Thank you Amazon for your excellent return/refund policy.
"
"
I'm overall happy with this product. It is a light, airy foam that helps to define my curls without any stickiness. I like that it's a pump so I can control how much product comes out and it lasts for a long time. I don't think it really volumizes my curls at the root, but that might just be because I have long hair and it's so heavy. I keep it in the shower and use it right after I shut the water off. Apply it to soaking wet hair and gently scrunch curls for the best result.
"
"
I gave this a 3 star. This product wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. Yes my curls were nice and soft but when I was washing my hair it was tangled and knotted during my shower. I had to use a detangler to wash my hair out! I'll only be using this product sparingly. I am of east Indian descent by the way and I have thick curly hair. And this is my honest review.
"
"
light and fluffydon't need too muchmy hair goes to my butt and i only use 1 pumpdoes magic to take away frizzy hairBUY THIS
"
"
I purchased this for my fine 2b/3a curls. I experienced no volume with this product and a light hold. Also, smells like cleaning solution.
"
"
It's okay, but not as special as I was hoping it would be, based on user reviews. It's like any other curly hair products out there that I've tried so far - leaves the hair feeling a bit stiff. Definitely can't get your fingers through it. And that's with only using a little amount. 3-Stars for being average. Oh well, my search continues.
"
"
It's OK...not sure where all the amazing reviews came from, but it's definitely not as good as some cheaper options I have tried. Maybe that's just my hair? I have wavy/slightly curly medium thickness hair.  Either way, Not Your Daughters products seem to work better for me at holding my wave/curl.
"
"
All of the DevaCurl products have changed my hair life.  I have always used cheaper products because I could not imagine spending this kind of money on my hair and I have never been happy with my hair.  I go from product to product.  I finally broke down and got the conditioner first and that started my journey of buying one product at a time.  I now own a line of them and will never look back!
"
"
I love this. I have wavy hair and it leaves a nice, uncrusty bounce. My daughter has ringlets and it coils them nicely with no heavy residue.
"
"
I use the styling cream and light defining gel and was pretty happy with those but needed a little more control without hairspray. Adding this mousse was the missing link! Curls last for days now, more manageable, and don’t need hairspray to make it cooperate. I have 3A curls and some gray streaks that don’t play by the rules. The mousse was just what I needed.
"
"
I’ve been using this product when I wear my hair curly for many years now. The DevaCurl line was introduced by my stylist when it first came out. She knew I was sensitive to scents and wanted a chemically clean product. The most important is that it works! It makes my curls bouncy, moist and controlled. Those of us with natural curls know that everyday you have to wet your hair to avoid the just got out of bed look. I like that I don’t have to wet my whole head but just let the shower sprinkle my hair and then add the foam for a quick touch up and go!
"
"
Did Deva curl change their product? I feel like the last bottle I had created more of a cast - this hardly creates one at all. I still like the product, but I feel like when the cast was harder it kept the humidity at bay more easily.
"
"
I didn't like this as well as other DevaCurl products. I didn't notice much volume added either. I prefer other DevaCurl products to this one, like the gel or cream.
"
"
Perfect weight for thinner hair. Barely feel it, doesn’t look wet. Best product I’ve found in 36 years!
"
"
The product itself is pretty good, but the dispenser is not adequate to deliver the goods.  I can't use the product if it is trapped inside a malfunctioning container.  It doesn't foam, and it won't come out except in runny drips.  I won't be purchasing this again.
"
"
Not worth the high price they have on it makes my hair stiff & sticky & I live in midwest. Their Shampoo_No Poo & conditioner is great for curly hair my hair was breaking & falling Out NOT AFTER USING THIS.
"
"
It's very light, doesn't weigh my hair down, smells great. But it doesn't really help with volume or frizz for me. I wouldn't buy it again. I feel like I wasted my money.
"
"
I am happy I got this. I feel like it gives my roots more volume and provides a no crunch frizz control option. It can be used in combo with just a curl cream or with the whole routine with oils, creams, and gel.  I use it almost every time I do my hair.
"
"
I don’t know how to feel about this product. All the reviews said it was great for curly hair but my hair came out horrible after I used it. No shine and sticky. It smells awesome though so I only use a tiny amount on my hair just for the smell because it was expensive so I gotta use it now. 😕
"
"
I love the DevaCurl curling gel, so I thought I would give the foam a try.  While it did keep my hair less frizzy I don't feel it make it have more volume and it felt drier than when I use the gel product.  Disappointed.
"
"
This product smells great. It is also feels super light weight. This product doesnt hold my curls well enough to use on its own. I do pair it with another product and it does okay on frizz, but not great.
"
"
I personally have seen the biggest difference in my hair from this product. It isn’t going to take and completely transform your hair texture, but it’s given me the best hair day I’ve had with my natural hair. I’m happy I tried it out.
"
"
White girl with curly hair that gets very frizzy in the summer from the heat and moisture in the air. I have gotten three compliments this week on how stylish my curls look. :)
"
"
It is the mouse of my live. I use this for me (wavy hair) and for my kids (super curly hair). The results in both cases are amazing. I love my hair
"
"
Love it,  but too pricey. I found a different product I equally enjoy.
"
"
Good product in this particular line.  Doesn’t leave your hair stiff or sticky.  Out of all of the Deva Curl styling products, I like this the best.  Does what it says, adds a little bit of volume.  Ive also tried the Curl Maker spray and the styling gel.
"
"
DevaCurl products are pricey but do the job. Very pleased with the control this product offers for thick, hard to control wavy hair.
"
"
This is a great product for giving your curls a lift! I apply at the roots and diffuse upside down. Works great!
"
"
Got this to use with the curly girl method and so far so good! After a few days it gets a little nasty though due to buildup. Would definitely recommend for good waves/curls
"
"
While I am a huge fan of Deva products, this one was a disappointment. It does nothing to my hair. I was hoping it would replace my mousse, but it was no effective at all.
"
"
My kinky natural curly hair loves this product!  I don't wash it every day and this product helps to keep it nicer longer.  No frizz and it doesn't weight my hair down.
"
"
This stuff is soooooo light weight! I absolutely love the smell! If you have unruly hair that needs a strong hold, thisnis not for you! I use this on my roots to add the extra volumenim looking for, and to keep my fly aways tame.
"
"
I have ordered this product 3 times now.  It takes the frizz out of my hair and gives me soft curls. I will buy it again.
"
"
I’ve used this product for years. But the people that sent me this definitely didn’t know what they were doing. It was sent without a lid, dusty, and dirty on the outside and in the spout. Kind of disturbing when buying something your planning on putting on your head...
"
"
The Devacurl frizz volumizing texturizing foam holds my curly hair after I scrunch it and it does not frizz or dry out my hair. Leaves a great shine to my hair.
"
"
If you have curly hair, this is perfect for you!! You gotta try this & you won't regret it. The only product my kid will use on her hair. Seriously.....try it.
"
"
This is my go-to product for wavy-curly hair. It dries to a soft ""cast"" that I can easily break up with my fingers. Later, if I wet and dry the hair.
"
"
Great for my curls but my scalp did not like these products. Gave me an itchy scalp.
"
"
I have curly hair and i've been looking for something to texturize my curls.  This isn't it.  It leaves them lackluster at best.
"
"
This works great on my wavey hair. Makes great spiral licks without the crunchy look.
"
"
Amazing stuff. I have short, fine wavy hair and I have NEVER had a product leave it so soft and not crunchy while still holding the wave and giving me volume. This stuff is worth the $$!
"
"
My favorite hair product. I love the way it leaves my hair. Soft and well shaped. I love it and buy it regularly.
"
"
It cause bad scalp to me. But works fine for my husband. Does the work pretty good, I liked how my curls turn out but sadly it is not for me.
"
"
Love deva products, especially lightweight ones.  My curly hair is thin, so I can't use any products to weigh it down.  This is perfect for roots for extra volume.
"
"
Great product for curly hair! Control without getting weighed down or greasy!
"
"
I think this seller should not be trusted.  The product smelled like 409 cleaner, so I immediately sent it back.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
This is great! I just wish it was not packaged in plastic and came in a travel size!
"
"
Originally, I loved the scent of this product.  However, after a few months, I noticed my hair was shedding way more than normal.  Low and behold, it was because of the Deva Curl. My hair is noticeably thinner. This is happening to a bunch of other people as well. There are youtube videos and a facebook group for you to see for yourself.  AVOID FROM USING.
"
"
This is the best curly haired styling product I've used in 20 years!  The key is this:  apply to damn hair.  Then WAIT till hair is dry and then scrunch your hair.  It will take away all the ""crispiness"" and leave you with soft bouncy curls.  This is KEY!! And a little goes a long way.
"
"
With really curly hair this product works well
"
"
This stuff is great for curly or wavy hair. Very moisturizing.
"
"
This works great for my baby fine curly hair.  It’s hard to find products that are light enough and this is just what I needed. It also has wonderful, clean light fragrance.  I will definitely purchase again!
"
"
Works so well with my low porosity 3a curls! Doesn't leave it feeling crunchy but controls frizz better than any other mousse I've used before
"
"
This is my second time purchasing this product, love the light weight  volume it give my fine curly hair
"
"
Product was listed as 7.5 oz and when it arrived it was 1.7 oz (for $11!).  Watch out for their false advertising.
"
"
This product unfortunately doesn't do much for my hair. It's similar to a lot of other foams. Makes my hair feel dry.
"
"
Keeps the frizz down. Put in hair while damp and watch it keep that frizz down all day. Oh and it smells like skittles.
"
"
I only use these products for my natural curly hair
"
"
Live in Florida and this product keeps the frizz away
"
"
Works great on curly hair. It is light weight. Smells wonderful.
"
"
Smells great too
"
"
It’s an ok product. Not really impressed left my hair full looking.
"
"
Not sure yet
"
"
Didn’t really do anything. Stylist suggested cream styler instead, after conditioner and believe in.  Won’t get this again.
"
"
Great product, but can also be used alone.  Also makes for a great curly cocktail.
"
"
Terrible. Did nothing but weigh down my hair and make it sticky
"
"
Dont use too much, gets crunchy ish
"
"
Great for extra volume at the roots
"
"
I have wavy hair and this is perfect for getting a strong curl and more volume.
"
"
I combine it with the B'leave in product, works great with my curls
"
"
Good
"
"
Best mouse out there
"
"
Love this product! Cruelty free and it actually works to keep the frizz down. When you apply it while your hair is wet it does not make your hair heavy or stiff at all. I live by this stuff!
"
"
Love the volume and texture it gives my very thin hair. I use it with a root-lifter product.
"
"
works
"
"
This helps define my wavy hair without weighing it down
"
"
With all the humidity this summer this product has helped so much!
"
"
This is the second time I have tried to purchase volumizing foam and received a different product. First I got the Build Up Buster and now I got a small Ultra Defining Gel. I will not be purchasing fr this seller again!
"
"
This product does not create the product cast around my curl as it normally does when I buy from an actual store front. I tried to complain to the company but they continue to deny and say it is real product. So disappointed.
"
"
This is an great foam. Unfortunately, it is too light for my hair type. I require a stronger hold.
"
"
Works great
"
"
This bottle lasts quite a while and adds a nice hold and texture to the hair.
"
"
Best curling substance. In fact, I love all Deva products. No stickiness or harsh chemicals.
"
"
I love that this does not make my hair crunchy
"
"
This product was changed since the last time I ordered it. It’s now heavier and makes my hair look bad no matter how little I use. I’m very disappointed.
"
"
Good hold . I run my fingers through my curls to loosen up after it dries but it’s my favorite product right now.
"
"
Not for hair type 3
"
"
Love this light foam. I don’t like the way gels leave my hair stiff. This leaves it slightly hard but once you fluff your fingers through it softens up.
"
"
great
"
"
I've been using this for years. Love this stuff. Keeps the frizz out of my curls without weighing them down. Keeps them looking natural.
"
"
Love these products.  Actually does work
"
"
This stuff works wonders, I have very thin, but wavy/curly hair, it makes my curls look great and helps with the frizz.
"
"
I was surprised because the product gives me different results every time I tried it /:
"
"
I've used this product for years and cannot live without it.
"
"
It did nothing but made my hair look dirty
"
"
Deva curl is awesome
"
"
Works great!  Great volume and no frizzy hairs.
"
"
I used this... and MY CURLS COMES ALIVE.  This is one of the best sh*t ever!! I haven’t  t used it with a a diffuser yet.... I heard it does wonders!
"
"
I love these products. Just wish it gave me a little more volume.
"
"
Like this for my thin curly hair
"
"
I love love love this product. The only catch is, I didn’t realize I was on the American site until too late (delivery).  Not only did I lose my prime shipping, BUT I still paid the same price prior to the convertible rate.
"
"
This product creates great volume and lasting curls, smells good, but is not noticeable after dryin.  Takes care of Frizz ...The best thing about it is that leaves hair soft but NOT TOO SOFT..  I LOVE IT
"
"
Work's great.  No stiff hair.
"
"
My absolute favorite mousse!  Have given up on all others and only use this one.  It gives my hair great body that lasts between washings.
"
"
My wife bought this for me as I have a full head of hair. Works great. No more frizz so I don't resemble Einstein any longer.
"
"
Deva curls makes my hair look and feel amazing!! Best product I have found for my curly hair in years!!
"
"
Love it
"
"
I actually liked the way this product worked with my curly hair. However, I traveled with it in my purse and to my dismay it opened itself and spilled stickiness all over my purse.
"
"
I found that this caused a bit of frizz for my hair.
"
"
I love this product. Can't believe it only has 3 stars
"
"
Bought this because all the great reviews Deva curl has; however, after the second application i noticed it was drying out my hair!!!!!
"
"
My daughter loves this. Light, and not stiff or sticky.
"
"
Doesn’t hold curls or tame frizz in a humid environment
"
"
Received on time. Product as expected. Real Deva curl mousse, not a knock off as I have experienced with other Vendors. Will order again, will recommend to friends. Very happy with my experience and purchase
"
"
Great product!!! Wonderful for adding volume and frizz free curls without all the stickiness...
"
"
The best for naturally curly hair.
"
"
Great for naturally curly hair. Create locks without frizz that don’t crunch.
"
"
delivered on time but it seems like it’s been used. the bottle was not completely full as i’ve seen it in other pictures. otherwise it works great
"
"
Best product for curly and frizzy hair. I've tried many products but this one is the best. It gives you defined curly 👍
"
"
Good
"
"
Love this stuff for my kids curly hair!
"
"
Perfect for curly frizzy hair.
"
"
This just made my fine, wavy hair look stringy. It definitely did not add definition or volume.
"
"
It doesn’t seem like the original, it smells very chemical like as if it was swapped out with something else.
"
"
Product creates volume with ✋ hair blower to maximize volume and doesn't leave crunchy effect.
"
"
Love this stuff!!
"
"
I absolutely love this stuff ... make my curls look great and definitely keeps the frizz away.
"
"
It's so light, my curls love it!
"
"
Love 💕
"
"
I would like more volume as my hair is fine. Overall will purchase again, it’s lightweight and controls frizz.

"
"
Works wonders

I live this product!! I have just wavy hair and use this plus the gel and get great curls!!! Love them!!!
"
"
Great product! Also does not flake, or turn color if touched.
"
"
It will make you’re hair fall out in clumps!
"
"
It's good product
"

My wife purchased these products and has loved them for her wavy hair.
"
"
I have more wavy hair and this product works to hold the shape without frizz
"
"
Great for wavy to slightly curly hair.  I use all of the Devacurl line ad prefer it over others I have tried.
"
"
Amazing. Been using this stuff ever since my devacut and it truly works.
"
"
I just tried to use the second one but the pump was defective, so it is completely useless.  Wasted money.
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
Good stuff, never used before.
"
"
LOVE this stuff!  Hy hair will not curl without it!
"
"
So nice
"
"
Love it use it after wash and during humid weather to quiet things down.
"
"
Good product. Quick delivery.
"
"
It definitely works. Make more volume.
"
"
Doesn't really do all that much. Smells great.
"
"
It was ok....hair was still a little frizzy.
"
"
Good for frizzy hair. Makes curls not frizz.
"
"
Love this product line! I get so many complements on my hair.
"
"
Good product

"
"
Very light weight
"
"
Amazing
"
"
Great
"
"
Very pleased with this product.  I have natural curls and as I age the curl has become more frizzy. My hair is also thin and fine. It really helps to manage my natural curls friz and adds volume.
"
"
Good
"
"
This is my go-to styling product for natural curls.
"
"
I love other Devacurl products but this one made my hair feel coarse and did not help with frizz at all.
"
"
Kept my curls soft and held them all day! I highly recommend.
"
"
Leaked all over packaging. Arrived almost empty
"
"
maybe my hair is too short to use the recommended amount ( one pump) it does give me volume but the best way to describe the result is as though i brushed my curls out  because it spreads the hair out in each curl which does give volume but probably not in the way one might not want with their curls. it does dry the hair out, I can go a full week without washing and my hair wont get oily as it usually does ( I have to wash 2-3x a week) as for frizz free well, what i describe the product doing is basically frizzy but its more like a good week with frizz.again it might have to do with my length, my hair is just starting to touch my shoulders so i would only recommend it to people with longer hair at least pass the shoulders.when i reach that length i definitely want to try this product again
"
"
Really like this foam, I have naturally wavy hair, and this helps me curl the waves and holds them well, I use this and the deva curl gel, o now I have curly waves, and I don't have to flat iron all the time..yay!!!
"
"
I couldn't leave the house without this product😊
"
"
I have very fine curly hair.  I recently learn about Diva Products and had been delighted with the results.  I found that for my fine hair the Curl Frizz-free Volumizing Foam works better than the gels.
"
"
I <3 Deva Curl, but this is not a winner at all, at least on its own.  I do see a difference when used with a gel.I used this with the Light Defining Gel, but it isn't as volumizing as I would have liked or expected, and I think the curl definition is from the gel.  When used on its own, it doesn't hold the frizz away at all, and I see no difference between my normal volume and using this product.  If you go to devacurl.com, this product is no longer available for purchase, so there might be a reason why.  Does smell amazing, though!
"
"
Devacurl products are causing thousands of people, myself included, to lose hair. My scalp is itchy, and I have to pull a huge wad of hair out of the drain every time i wash it. Please please do not buy Devacurl products. There is some chemical in their products that destroy curly hair. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
"
"
NO ONE BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS LINE THEIR PRODUCTS CAUSE HAIR LOSS AND CHEMICAL DAMAGE PLEASE BE CAREFUL
"
"
These completely revitalized my curls
"
"
Best thing that's ever happened to 3b/3c combination hair . Picture is day 2 curls just using water and the mousse.
"
"
I loved that this product was natural and was so pleased with the results...until my entire scalp broke out in large, cyst-like boils after using this product for a few days. It took about two weeks after stopping this product for the cysts to completely clear up and disappear. Really bummed because I wanted a natural curling product, but clearly there is gluten in this. If you have Celiacs or a severe gluten allergy, beware! You may need to find a new product.
"
"
This is the best product for curly (turning frizzy when it's humid) hair. If you have curly hair, you're probably always searching for a product that keeps the curl, doesn't dry your hair out, and does what it claims to do. This product comes through on all counts. It preserves my curl for at least three days because as you probably know it's too drying to shampoo curly hair daily. This product also doesn't leave your hair crunchy. It locks in curl but the curls are soft. Love this product!
"
"
I have baby fine, super thin hair that has a bit of wave/curl.  Most products for curly hair are way to heavy and oily for my hair.  This is very light, and holds the shape well, not too crunchy.  I have not used anything that is as effective for my hair type as this product is.  The smell is pleasant, in a way I cannot describe, though it's a tiny bit strong.
"
"
I bought this because I wanted soft touchable curls, this product gives u defined curls but doesn’t leave your hair soft, the curls are hard/crunchy, I was hoping for soft curls, you get the same results with regular mousse and less expensive. Again, if you are looking for defined curls, this product works well, it doesn’t smell as good as some of the reviews say it does, u will also need to use a lot of the product and make sure all the hair strands have it otherwise your will end up with shine and dry looking hair.Keep this in mind since u can’t return it once u have open it.I hope this review helps
"
"
I already have wavy hair but this just enhances my curls.  Best product I have found but you have to apply right out of the shower and squeeze the wetness like you are crunching the hair together in locks with head down.  Then do not dry with towel but use a t-shirt to get the heavy water and then diffuse it with the hairdryer to get it completely dry.  I find if you air dry it is doesn't curl as well.  No other method wil work and if you dry it with a towel and put it on just damp hair it does not work.  Curls last all day.
"
"
So far when using this product it makes my hair feel dry.  I hope to find a finishing spray that will help with the ""dry"" or I will return it.  I posted a review a few weeks ago and NOW in the news it is being reported that others are also have dry hair and losing hair.  DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT!!  It's horrible.  I wish I had put in for a refund only a few days ago
"
"
I have wavy hair - type 2b with fine hair - and this product (when used in tandem with another) helps give my hair its spiral hold and cut frizz/add volume.  I repurchase whenever I start running low.Good product!
"
"
I only use this product on second or third day hair as a way to tame frizz and redefine my curls.  It does not work for me when I am trying to create my curls.  It's got too soft a hold.  It doesn't create a cast, as gels and other products do.  But the scent is beautiful and delicate.  Not too strong.
"
"
I’m a no blow dry, no flat-iron/curling wand type mom. So I wanted something I could throw in after shower that would hold together my somewhat fluffy hair. This left it kinda stiff and very blah looking. I do love diva curl super cream though! I will be throwing this out and ordering super cream next.
"
"
I have fine, curly/wavy shoulder length hair. While still soaking wet,  I use 3 pumps of this and evenly distribute as much as possible, without breaking up the curls, before carefully scrunching with a microfibre towel. Next, I diffuse and then leave to air-dry until completely dry before breaking the cast on the curls. Voila !! Nothing else comes close. It's a non-sticky light foam and has a light fragrance. It also leaves hair (once cast broken) feeling soft and touchable and with a great shine.This is not easy to find in the UK so I was really pleased to be able to order on Amazon.com. Delivery was reasonably quick too so I'm one happy curly-girl.
"
"
My 2B/2C hair responds best to this foam -- it's light, quick-drying and has the right amount of hold. I'm left with big soft curls the circumference of sidewalk chalk. Generally I'll apply the foam to micro-plopped hair, give it 5 minutes then scrunch in a bit of water-emulsified gel before diffusing.
"
"
I just read about class action lawsuit against this company as it’s causing hair loss, thinning and skin problems and more in woman that are using  it. I want to return it but it’s past the return window. In the garbage it goes!!
"
"
This foam is light both in texture and hold.  It includes a curl enhancer. I combine with other Deva products for more hold.
"
"
Great volume and I enjoy using this as a refresher a lot but I don’t find it to be super helpful with frizz — I could have frizz for a million reasons though so who knows! I’m 2C/3A low porosity
"
"
I cannot say enough about the Deva Curl line of styling products! I have tried everything out there to manage my curly hair and I have finally found something that works! I highly recommend it!
"
"
The product is the exact replica of the larger size but can be taken in your carry-on. As someone who travels a lot but always needs to use a hair product to maintain body and curl I have been frustrated for years that this product didn't come in a travel size. I am THRILLED that DevaCurl finally got the message that consumers wanted a small size!
"
"
This was disappointing for the money spent and from a Curly Girl company.  I found it to be sticky and did not control frizz.  I tried putting in more product to control frizz but then my hair looked oily and it left a residue.
"
"
I love DevaCurl products. This smells so good. It is light and works great in my hair. I do use the Arc Angel gel and the  Bleave in with this in my hair. My hair looks curly, healthy, and feels soft
"
"
It's a tad on the expensive side, but the best one on the market in my opinion. It gives great volume even on second and third day.
"
"
I have mostly gray, fine curly hair.  I’m always looking for more volume and this really makes a difference. It’s lightweight too. I really like it.
"
"
Love this!! It definitely gives me almost too much volume sometimes but it’s light weight, not sticky or crunchy. Pairs great with other Devacurl products
"
"
Terrible waste of money. This made my curly hair stringy and dried it out. I only used it three times and it took a few weeks for my hair to recover.
"
"
Love this stuff. Great for daily styles. Doesn’t carry over as well the next day. Some products you can go two days with. Just have to plan accordingly.
"
"
This made my hair look amazing. I have naturally curly/wavy hair and this gave me so much volume and was not damaging to my hair unlike a lot of other products. Will be using again.
"
"
Devacurl Frizz free foam works great for me!  I like the softness of my hair rather than when I was using Deva Gel.  However, when it is really humid out I still use the gel as well as the foam.
"
"
Product ended up making the hair more frizzy and sticky. The smell is also very odd. Not sure if this is a real product or got mixed with something else. Disappointing :(
"
"
I didn't like this product. My hair was really frizzy, and it's supposed to do the opposite. Didn't work for my 3c hair type.
"
"
LOVE this product! I'm always skeptical to try new products, but DevaCurl is worth the hype. The foam is lightweight, yet defines my curls wonderfully. Product arrived on time and wrapped in plastic to prevent leakage. I would definitely recommend to others or buy again!
"
"
THE BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE!! I have tried many things for my natural curls and this is by far the best thing I have used.  Gives me soft perfect curls (I use the curly girl method)
"
"
This works great if you are trying to avoid alcohol in your hair products
"
"
You got curl then this is good for you curly girls. I have thick curly hair and it works well, feels soft and does help with frizz too
"
"
I like this for my roots, I like a little lift on the top of my head.
"
"
I don’t like that it smells like coconut. I know most people like it. But nothing else controls my curls and leaves them touchable.
"
"
This product didn’t do anything for my volume, and just makes my hair sticky .
"
"
I would send this back if I could. I've used the same Paul Mitchell mouse for years and it's by far superior to this product. I have curly hair and thought by the hype that this might be the bomb. No. I hate to waste stuff so I use it on the days I'm not going anywhere.
"
"
More volume than I wanted. Curls too tight.
"
"
The best curly hair product in the world! You use very little so it lasts so long!
"
"
Made my long curly hair frizzy.
"
"
It came quickly, glad for the extra wrapping as it did leak during shipping, but will definitely shop again for products! Works great!
"
"
Love love love ALL Diva Curl products
"
"
It does not control the frizz and the volume of the hair.  It Leaves my hair rough and dull.  I do not recommend.
"
"
Good product great volume control
"
"
too heavy for my fine hair.....
"
"
Love this. Seems best for finer hair like mine. Works better when a diffuser is used. Not sticky or crunchy. Curls are soft and shiny
"
"
It does cause me to break out along side my face but it holds my hair well enough for Filipina hair.
"
"
Does the job
"
"
It's okay, but not great
"
"
great price, authentic product
"
"
I think its over hyped on youtube. I bought it thinking it would be better than other curling foams out there, and, its the same thing but with a bigger price tag.
"
"
This product is indispensable.  Between shampoos, I'll just dampen my hair in the shower, scrunch some of the foam in my hair, and my rejuvenated curls spiral beautifully.
"
"
You don't need a lot... but boy it will feel like you used a lot!!!! This stuff is amazing for reviving curls!!!! :)
"
"
I recently got a spiral perm and I thought this product would help control the frizz but I am thoroughly disappointed. I am going back to using my old trusted Lanza products.
"
"
It has a horrible smell and literally did nothing on my hair .
"
"
Love this keeps all my frizz away. A little goes a long way.
"
"
Not worthy.  It damaged my hair more than it was. I returned it.
"
"
Gooood thing, work great
"
"
Wes curl fro frizzing
"
"
Love how light this product is! It doesn’t weigh my curls down like other products.
"
"
Great product,  great.for the frizz.
"
"
Works perfect for fine curly hair.  It does not weigh it down and your hair can be fluffed up for several days by misting hair with water after initial application.
"
"
White crap in hair
"
"
Where has DevaCurl been all my curly haired life?! This product has made my hair look better than ever.
"
"
Love this product, keeps my curls fresh all day.
"
"
Leaves my curls on point!
"
"
Very good
"
"
Love this foam, doesn't leave my hair oily and does exactly what it says it will do!
"
"
Wife likes the price much better than the store
"
"
excellent
"
"
Love this stuff. Really makes my hair stay curly and soft
"
"
Did not help control the frizz
"
"
Didn't do anything for my curly hair.
"
"
Love this stuff it's wonderful.
"
"
Used this for year.  Amazon has great price.
"
"
This product does help with adding volume to my hair. It's not my first purchase.
"
"
I love it
"
"
it's ok, i like that it doesnt leave noticable residue but it doesnt do much for frizz and leaves hair feeling crunchy
"
"
The has been the best product for my curls. It keeps the under control just not stiff as a board.
"
"
If you have naturally curly hair these products are amazing!
"
"
I can't live without this product.
"
"
I like it
"
"
Perfect for my daughter's curls
"
"
Terrific curly hair product at a great price. Arrived promptly well packed.
"
"
Love this product came very quick once ordered
"
"
Love this foam! Works great!
"
"
Worked well just sticky
"
"
Best mousse that I've ever used. Not sticky and gives volume.
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
This makes my hair look fantastic. Always will use this going forward!
"
"
I love this mousse for my natural curls
"
"
Deva is the best. I have long, thick curls and I live in Texas so we get long dry stretches or torrential rain or swampy humidity. This product seems to handle it all, with style. It's my everyday go-to product. Thanks for keeping me curly, Deva!!
"
"
Love this. I order it regularly to use along with the deva curl gel.
"
"
makes hair hard--use mousse its cheaper same result
"
"
Lightweight. Doesn't control frizz as well as cream.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
I always looked at this product and for whatever reason I just didn't want to try it.  There are so many products that claim to be frizz-free and then they're a disappointment.  I tried this one with no expectations of anything.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.  So, it must have been fluke results.  So, I tried it again.  Great results.  Just as an FYI, I have 3c hair that has had a Deva Cut.  So getting volume was important since that was the intention of my haircut.  I have volume.  I have lift and it is also a great 2nd or 3rd or more day refresher product.  The product isn't sticky.I use the Deva Buildup Buster shampoo and then I condition with Deva One Condition.  Then on reasonably wet (not dripping and not damp) hair, I apply the foam.  If you apply this product or any of Deva's styling products, it's important to start with wet hair or the results aren't as good.  I start with my roots and work my way to my ends.  After I apply the Deva Coconut SuperCream.  I have applied gel after the cream.  But, I reserve that for the most humid days.  Also any with Deva products:  Cream THEN Gel.  These are some great products, but I often see lots of reviews of so-so and negative reviews and I can almost bet they either applied them on hair that wasn't wet enough or out of the cream/gel order.
"
"
I have fine, thin, curly hair that tends to frizz. Wow! this product really helps! Finally somebody made products that work for my hair. Thank you so much! My curls look more organized and don't feel stiff.  I liked this product so well, I went back and bought the other products this company makes.
"
"
It weighs down my curls and I don’t like the feeling on my hair.
"
"
First - I used the DevaCurl site to recommend this for my fine wavy hair. I bought this and the Ultra Defining Gel at the same time, expecting that I would need both to control frizz, but this product works great alone.  I do use the Ultra Defining Gel for any fly aways as a finishing step.  With my medium length fine hair, I use about 2 pumps and then use my diffuser.  My hair gets super curly vs wavy and doesn't look crispy, but more shiny, which is what I prefer.  I haven't tried many specialized curl products like this, because the ones I have tried in the past were a disaster.  I never knew my hair could be this curly.  I really like this DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam.  The only thing I do not like is that it feels a tiny bit chalky when I run my fingers through at the end of the day before going to bed.
"
"
I admit I was skeptical to try this.  I read some mixed reviews about it drying out the hair after use.  I needed to try something as my hair has been acting strange lately.  The curl pattern was getting tighter, stringy looking and I had build up on my hair from experimenting with some Ouidad & Wetline hair gel products.  I kept reading in the good reviews that it really revitalized curls and made them light and bouncy again so decided to order it.  I dispensed the product directly against my scalp as they instruct and used enough to bring the liquid level down to right above the top of the label if that makes sense.  I used my fingertips to massage it in.  It has a thick gel like consistency and it lathers slightly.  The smell is good and not too strong.  After massaging it into my scalp I used my wetbrush to gently comb through the end of my hair and up to my scalp to make sure the product was worked though and my hair was detangled.  I followed with my Deva Curl One Condition which I left on until the end of my shower.  Sure enough, my curls were revitalized, clumped in bigger curls like before, the tightness was gone and my hair was very soft and light feeling.  I did not experience any of the dryness that others mentioned in their reviews.  I plan to use this about every two weeks or more if I feel my hair needs it sooner.
"
"
I have mostly wavy hair that gets definite curl when I use a diffuser. Because of that, I need to keep my hair clear of as much product as possible but I hate shampooing more than once or twice a week because I want to keep all the moisture that I can. This was a great alternative to ""reset""  my hair every 2-3 weeks. It definitely brings the curl back by clearing away any heavy product. It also smells fantastic, I love walking around the day that I use it and enjoying the scent.  Definitely worth the purchase.
"
"
This was so soothing on my scalp. I struggle with a dry itchy scalp and this has helped immensely. The nozzle helps to get through my thick 3a/3b hair and I noticed an immediate difference in my hair afterwards. It almost has a cooling sensation that makes your hair feel refreshed and clean. It was like an ACV rinse without the nasty smell lol. It does give a deep clean but my hair didn't feel stripped or overly dry so it seems to work really well for me!
"
"
Since I began using all Deva products, my curls have never looked better. However, those of us in the silver sisterhood have an additional issue... product buildup can give silver or white hair a yellowish tinge. And since my curls can look great for four days between cleansings with nothing but a water spritz and a bit of gel, even an occasional use of non-Deva  purple shampoo wasn't fixing the yellow caused by buildup. I was sceptical, I have no idea what ""micellar"" is, but Buildup Buster works!  A weekly use, followed by one of the Deva treatment products has my silver sparkling and my hair isn't dry at all.
"
"
I'm sorry I have to say this- but it actually PUT buildup in my hair that I can't get out. I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed my hair again, and even now there is STILL sticky product coating my hair strands making it greasy and clumpy. When I touch my hair, my fingers are sticky. It's like I can't get this stuff off for the life of me. I bought it and had a friend bring it to me because of the hard water in south east asia, and now I'm afraid I won't find another product here to be able to undo the huge mess this product made.
"
"
Update 8/19/18:Due to the cost of this product, I wasn’t willing to allow it just one application.Yesterday, I used it again, but instead of applying deep conditioner and rinsing it out immediately, I used the same deep conditioner for 20 minutes. Problem solved. I changed my rating from 1 star.This product was horrible for my hair. Made it feel like straw even after applying a deep conditioner. I never get tangles combing out my hair. After applying this product and conditioner, I couldn't get my wide-tooth comb through my hair. This is the first time my hair felt like straw while it was still wet. I listened to a lot of reviews on YouTube before I purchased this product. It seems to work well for black women but it didn't work for this white woman. Since there wasn't a seal over the opening, I have my doubts that this product is authentic.
"
"
I heard about this product just as it was being launched. It's a hallelujah type product that will remove excess product buildup on hair and on scalp. It does take some time to learn how to use this. You should  allow for that learning curve because the tip of the bottle isn't quite long enough to section hair out  and it does require squeezing the bottle  pretty substantially to get the liquid to come out.  Note that you should allow at least 20 minutes for application depending on hair length. Also there is a waiting time for it to be on hair and scalp before it is rinsed off.It does a great job though and doesn't strip hair.
"
"
This stuff is amazing. If it stripped your hair then you must have the wrong hair type for this stuff. It completely removed all of the built up product in my hair and now it looks amazing, I'm going to do this treatment maybe once every two weeks!! Absolutely wonderful product.
"
"
I saw this product on a YouTube testimonial, and BOY did this product change my life!!!! I had been spending sooooo much time daily trying to revive my curls, but all they needed was the hard water buildup removed!!!!  After the first few minutes of application in the shower, I FELT my curls springing back to life under my fingertips.  My hair looked great that day, and I was able to maintain and refresh the curls for 4 days after.  I plan to make this product part of my weekly routine!
"
"
I have curly hair, and use product daily, and my hair had become weighted down and dull. I came across a video on YouTube about a salon that offers a scalp detox that showed the buildup on your scalp from product, and started looking into a good detox product that I could use at home, and ended up ordering this off a recommendation.I used it the day it came in, and I'm pretty sure I had the best hair day ever. My hair felt so much lighter, my scalp didn't feel itchy, and I couldn't be happier. It's completely worth it!

I bought it and had a friend bring it to me because of the hard water in south east asia, and now I'm afraid I won't find another product here to be able to undo the huge mess this product made.

Update 8/19/18:Due to the cost of this product, I wasn’t willing to allow it just one application.Yesterday, I used it again, but instead of applying deep conditioner and rinsing it out immediately, I used the same deep conditioner for 20 minutes. Problem solved. I changed my rating from 1 star.This product was horrible for my hair. Made it feel like straw even after applying a deep conditioner. I never get tangles combing out my hair. After applying this product and conditioner, I couldn't get my wide-tooth comb through my hair. This is the first time my hair felt like straw while it was still wet. I listened to a lot of reviews on YouTube before I purchased this product. It seems to work well for black women but it didn't work for this white woman. Since there wasn't a seal over the opening, I have my doubts that this product is authentic.

I heard about this product just as it was being launched. It's a hallelujah type product that will remove excess product buildup on hair and on scalp. It does take some time to learn how to use this. You should  allow for that learning curve because the tip of the bottle isn't quite long enough to section hair out  and it does require squeezing the bottle  pretty substantially to get the liquid to come out.  Note that you should allow at least 20 minutes for application depending on hair length. Also there is a waiting time for it to be on hair and scalp before it is rinsed off.It does a great job though and doesn't strip hair.
"
"
This stuff is amazing. If it stripped your hair then you must have the wrong hair type for this stuff. It completely removed all of the built up product in my hair and now it looks amazing, I'm going to do this treatment maybe once every two weeks!! Absolutely wonderful product.
"
"
I saw this product on a YouTube testimonial, and BOY did this product change my life!!!! I had been spending sooooo much time daily trying to revive my curls, but all they needed was the hard water buildup removed!!!!  After the first few minutes of application in the shower, I FELT my curls springing back to life under my fingertips.  My hair looked great that day, and I was able to maintain and refresh the curls for 4 days after.  I plan to make this product part of my weekly routine!
"
"
I have curly hair, and use product daily, and my hair had become weighted down and dull. I came across a video on YouTube about a salon that offers a scalp detox that showed the buildup on your scalp from product, and started looking into a good detox product that I could use at home, and ended up ordering this off a recommendation.I used it the day it came in, and I'm pretty sure I had the best hair day ever. My hair felt so much lighter, my scalp didn't feel itchy, and I couldn't be happier. It's completely worth it!
"
"
I’m super impressed with this product! Living in Florida I have found that gel is the best way for my curls to be in ringlets instead of frizzy due to the humidity. But because I use so many products in hair, I have noticed a lot of build up. At first I thought it was the gel “flaking” off, then I thought I might have dandruff but after some research I decided to try this buildup buster. Holy moly does it work! After the 1st use I noticed a 100% difference! The flakes were gone! I have used it twice now and still love it! Definitely a must in your hair care routine!
"
"
I think this is a good product. It really does clean the scalp well. My only issue is that I feel like I have to use a ton of it to really get my entire scalp clean.I bought this because I had severe build-up from a vacation where I forgot some of my products. My hair felt miserable and was gross—this really did help make my scalp feel super clean without being incredibly dry.This product doesn’t lather much because it doesn’t rely on sulfates (that’s totally fine!), but I have thick hair and it can be somewhat difficult and product consuming to get it evenly over my scalp. I think it’s a nice product and may work for others, but instead of purchasing this I’d rather buy a clarifying shampoo instead, especially for this price where I can get more for my money.
"
"
I love this stuff!I use it to remove mineral build up from well water so my color takes more evenly.I was using another brand. But my curly hair was not a fan of it. It seemed very harsh, and made it extremely difficult to comb thru while the product was in or after. Came as a powder in packets. Never felt I had enough.Thus smells great is easy to apply and comb and my color is taking better than it has in a very long time. Will continue to use. Highly recommend!
"
"
For curly hair curls that struggle to find the best moisturizing and cleaning shampoo try this product out! It amazing! My hair feels smooth, very hydrated and super clean! Doesn’t dry out hair . Will have to purchase more than one next time because I have a lot of hair and the serum is very thin but it’s amazing . I can use this daily or one a week . I use this product 3x a week and it’s like a micellular water but for hair ! Replacing my shampoo!
"
"
Sadly this product didn't work for my curl pattern (3b) and I returned it. Instead of removing the buildup in my hair it actually ADDED more buildup. Leaving my hair feel greasy or as if I put gel all over. So if your curl pattern is 3a-3c then it may not work. If you need a visual for 3a-3c curl patterns just google it :)
"
"
I was on the fence about whether to get this because of the price, but I'm glad I did! I have 2b/2c hair. For the past few weeks, I kept having bad hair days with frizz and stretched-out waves. I thought a trim would fix it, but it didn't. Finally, I used this and WOW! My hair looks amazing, it's soft, shiny, and the waves are not stretched out anymore. I even have some spirals! For reference, I used this in place of my shampoo, then conditioned with Cantu conditioner, and scrunched with Shea Moisture curling gel souffle.
"
"
I thought I was going to enjoy this product because of the great reviews. The scent is awful, smells like flea and tick shampoo to me. It did cleanse my scalp but the thought of massaging these ingredients into my scalp was horrible every time. I figured since I spent about $20 on it mine as well use it, but my health is worth way more than a clarifying shampoo. In this society where our bodies are constantly bombarded by toxins in the air, water, and foods we eat. The last thing we need is a hair product with carcinogenic, hormone distributing chemicals massaged into our bodies. Be mindful!
"
"
Wow, this really does the job.  After using it and it has removed the residue of the products I always use after washing my hair, I am back to the beginning with a fresh start!  I love it!  Really great product and I will always keep it on hand.  I think it is a necessity to use every couple of weeks.
"
"
My hair does not like this product, which makes me really sad. It's got a lot of protein so I guess my hair is protein sensitive. I have wavy hair so I would recommend this to more kinky curls than wavy hair.
"
"
I suffer from dandruff.  This allows me to go a day longer (four days) without an itchy scalp as opposed to the no-poo shampoo. My hair feels clean, but I need something stronger for my scalp.
"
"
This size bottle and pointed tip is convenient for applications to the scalp.
"
"
Maybe I didnt do it right but my scalp legit got sooooooo extremely dry I scratched my scalp raw. Eventually as I conditioned and stuff it got better. But dang. I wish it worked.
"
"
Honestly the only DevaCurl product that has disappointed me so far. It left my hair feeling really greasy and gross. But my hair is super picky, and everyone's hair is different. So who knows, this may be the product for you even if it wasn't for me.
"
"
This stuff is great!  It definitely cleanses all the dirt, waxes, toxins and whatever else collects in your hair.  I use it about once every two weeks for thorough cleanse.  I recommend it.
"
"
Love this!  Was nervous about negative reviews but my experience was just what I hoped.  Used it once and my hair feels soft and cleaner than it has in ages. Worked into scalp then through hair.  Followed with Deva Curl conditioner and gel, as usual.  Hair livelier than it has been in ages with no sense of build up.  Perfect.
"
"
Before you purchase this product look into the current class action lawsuit against Deva Curl regarding ALL of their products. Save yourself the  heartache, hair loss and damage. Take 5 min to look on YouTube to see what is happening to other users.
"
"
This is not something to use every time I shampoo - I think it would dry out my hair. But it’s great for cleaning off all build-up of styling products, really does the trick. I only use it about every 5th or 6th time I wash my hair (which is thick and curly)
"
"
Not a fan. It makes my scalp greasy (when other cleanser shampoos do not).
"
"
I recently tried the build up buster for the first time on my own after visiting a professional curly girl salon. I love the way it cleanses my scalp and hair without stripping all of the moisture. The smell is nice (in a kind of tropical lemonny way). I liked the performance of the cleanser so much I purchased the larger size the 2nd time. The cost for the 8oz is quite expensive so it made more sense to go larger and get more product.
"
"
I really do like this. I use it once a month maybe twice. It really gets my scalp clean and fresh. Since I cowash my hair 2 times a week at most during winter less. Therefore the Deva buildup buster is good to get my hair ready for the next round.
"
"
I love this stuff. I had not realized how dull and lifeless product build up was making my hair.  I rarely use the No Poo anymore.  This is so much better!
"
"
My Deva stylist recommended this for my hair to give it a nice refresh. After using a sample I ordered an entire bottle. This is great to use either once a week or once a month to get rid of build up and refresh your curls.  I also use it once a month on my daughters hair and it helps perk her curl back up.
"
"
Wow. I have my old hair back!  I’m glad that I read the reviews and tips. My hair felt like straw after washing so I packed on the conditioner and used a wide tooth comb in the shower. My hair now has defined waves and curls.
"
"
It was light day and night! My hair felt lighter the same day! I use this with a scalp massager and use this once a week for 3bish hair!
"
"
Cleaned off product build up in one use.. WOW amazing. I only use it when I need it so the bottle should last me for a long while
"
"
Let me preface this by saying I almost never write review, but this product is so magical I had to share its merits to all the curly girls (or guys!) out there who are frustrated by the state of their hair. Where I live, we have exceptionally hard water and cold dry winters. That combined with near daily product use, my hair was flat and curls out of sorts. Today? I feel like a curl goddess! Life has been thrown back into my curls, they’re soft/bouncy and they just look so much better! Additionally, i did NOT feel like this product “striped” my hair like other clarifying products do. For reference, I have finer hair and 3B curls.
"
"
This is useful in removing build-up, but I think I’d prefer a clarifying shampoo. I have naturally 3c curly/coily hair, and this product does not create enough slip to fee like I’m spreading it thoroughly to each strand. Afterward my hair has that squeaky clean feel, so it definitely gets the job done.
"
"
This product is okay but overhyped. I still have to go in with shampoo after bc it doesn't leave my hair feeling as clean as I would like.
"
"
I have been using DEVA product for two years. I really like using the Devacurl buildup Buster Hair Cleanser. It makes my hair glow and strengthen it. I use it twice a week.
"
"
This stuff is outstanding at ridding the build up from product, but doesn't leave my hair feeling dry.  My curls are so bouncy after using this!
"
"
Love this shampoo. It gets the buildup off of my hair just as described! Use it about every 2 to 3 weeks. Works well.
"
"
it is a good product, but for the value i expected more. nothing that a good sulfate free shampoo wouldn't do. but it is a good product.
"
"
I have really been looking forward to this product. However, shipping to Moscow takes too long. That was kind of a bummer. Such a pity that it's so hard to find Deva Curl products when ur not living in the West.
"
"
I think this is a great clarifying wash to remove buildup, I use it once a week and follow with melt into moisture. You have to use quite a lot though (I do have long hair). I also know that there's a lot of DevaCurl ripoffs on Amazon, but this is the real deal!
"
"
This is so great for removing buildup. I have very fine, wavy hair and this keep it perky!
"
"
Gets my hair nice and clean just the way I want it. I love it.
"
"
Easy to use and did a great job busting product build up that the regular devacurl shampoos miss.
"
"
love this product.  Didn't know how much i needed it until i started using it.  Great for getting rid of product buildup with out stripping moisture.  Great for curly damaged or dry hair
"
"
Great clarifier for silicone or other product buildup. I use it about once a month.
"
"
Removed the buildup from my weekly product usage without stripping my hair.  Not overly drying. I didn’t shampoo after, I just followed with my Deva curl conditioner and some coconut curl cream and had a great hair day.
"
"
I felt like this product only helped a little bit, i really don't like how thick it is, harder to get out of the bottle.
"
"
Great gentle build up cleanser.
"
"
My daughter in law wanted to try but was pretty expensive.  Great price here.
"
"
I like the smell and it works fine, just not seeing any benefit to using it compared to other products I like better.
"
"
Great cleanser! I use it once a month and it has helped my hair health so much!
"
"
Great product, lots of slip to get out knots in your hair before you shampoo.
"
"
No stripping cleanser. I really like this. It gets my hair clean without feeling dry.
"
"
My hair is a 3b to an angry 3c if I let it go too long without care ...this does the job for me...I get my hair soaking wet, put a little at the ends and it works wonders for that purpose...It really helps me break up the dry naps and knots.
"
"
Great product! But I feel that it could be cheaper for the amount that you get.
"
"
Product really works to remove build up.  Especially good for removing the affects of salt water.
"
"
Yes
"
"
It doesn't smell all that great but it works great on my hair which, is super curly.  I really like the results.
"
"
Makes my scalp feel squeaky clean. I use this monthly. Highly recommend!
"
"
This product, along with the other devacurl products I used caused major hair loss and loss of volume and definition. Devacurl needs to address this issue and Do some major recalls and explain what happened.
"
"
Didn't do anything for my hair except make it heavy and greasy
"
"
Strong cleaning
"
"
I love DevaCurl products and this one is one of my favorites. I use it once a week to remove buildup from my scalp and hair. It cleans my hair and I feel anew again. I am already seeing that my hair is more healthy. It also can be used as a shampoo.
"
"
Product success!!!!! My hair says thank you when I use it. I love.
"
"
Great
"
"
My curls were feeling a little droopy, but this perked them right up! This is definitely going to be a staple in my hair care routine.
"
"
I'm not sure this product is really worth it.  I will use up what I have and then use Vitamin C powder for my detox treatments in the future.
"
"
The smell remains me of spa :))However, It was not harsh to my scalp but I needed a deep conditioner.
"
"
Isn't this the same as ""Buildup Buster""?  I just rated that as a wonderful product.
"
"
Works great
"
"
A great addition to my DevaCurl routine.
"
"
I works perfect
"
"
This worked better than i could have imagined!. It's a thick gel that is easy to apply to the roots.
"
"
Love this! Works great for the scalp but also for any other area, for example armpits.
"
"
best shampoo that I have seen really gets it clean and doesnt dry out the hair
"
"
Its honestly just ok. I expected it to do miracles on my hair and it didn't.
"
"
Didn't see much difference. But product didn't make my hair feel dry. It was soft.
"
"
Add to shampoo
"
"
Love love love this product for my daughters curly hair! Even for mine, it’s nice to use once a week to get rid of all the product build up and it’s gentle on the scalp!
"
"
Gentle and easy on the hair. I use it two days in a row every two weeks. Really gets rods of the final from other products.
"
"
It is not your normal sudsing shampoo but it gets the job done. You don't need a lot of it to wash and it is not drying. I would surprisingly buy this product again.
"
"
Good product, just make sure you rinse it out well.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Very convenient
"
"
Leaves scalp feeling free and clean of buildup!
"
"
Great for getting buildup off. I use once a week, with a deep conditioning treatment after
"
"
it didn't do much for my kids hair. it looks the same
"
"
Having super curly hair and using A LOT  of product, I usually have tons of buildup. This worked like a charm and my scalp felt so fresh
"
"
Worked for me!
"
"
Love this so much. Works well.
"
"
Love! Makes the curls POP! Only wish the price was lower but love the product
"
"
I’ve used it  about 4 times and I really don’t feel any change.
"
"
Works great.  I love DevaCurl Products.  It takes the buildup from gel out.  I use this maybe once a week or every 2 weeks.  Great Product
"
"
Great product!
"
"
I can feel the difference after using it... and I love the smell
"
"
they use a ingredients that acts as a relaxer
"
"
I love this product.
"
"
Great product leaves my hair looking an feeling great
"
"
I use DevaCurl products exclusively.  I have Botticelli curls and I use the buildup buster once a week help keep my curls cleansed. Love it!
"
"
Does what it should, rinsed very clean and leaves your hair ready for styling shampoo and conditioners.
"
"
I love this product is really refreshes my hair and gives my curls back their life
"
"
the product didn't suds up a lot but had good slip. used it to remove any product video.
"
"
Love the scent and how it really makes my scalp feel clean.
"
"
Love my curls with this product
"
"
Really cleans your scalp
"
"
Love this.
"
"
This product does what is says it will do, it removes product build up well. My hair felt clean without feeling dry.
"
"
Amazing price! Love this item cleans the scalp super well!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Really helps with build up!!
"
"
It's just eeh.
"
"
Purchased it for my daughter
"
"
Yay loved it
"
"
AMAZING
"
"
This is so amazing. If you're into curl typing I have 4B hair and my curl pattern is so much defined so I LOOOOOOOOVE this stuff. I use it with deva conditioner but, afterwards I use a conditioner with more slip to detangle.
"
"
This works GREAT! Didn’t realize I had build up until I used this. My hair felt different right after my first use. No regrets here! The bottle is a good size to hold in the shower (not bulky).
"
"
Clarifying is a must for curlies because residue means flat, greasy, frizzy curls, but it's a tradeoff because of the moisture stripping action of clarifying shampoos. Buildup Buster removes every molecule of buildup without removing the slightest bit of moisture. My hair is left soft, shiny and extra bouncy. Also, you shouldn't need to clarify all that often, so this will last you a good, long while.
"
"
Its okay, but its so thick that its hard to get it out of the bottle. This is a super thick shampoo with a good scent, cleanses well. I will not repurchase, though because its expensive and their are other shampoos that work just as well if not better.
"
"
I’ve found that DevaCurl products are kind of hit or miss. This one is a miss. It did not help with my buildup and all, and instead made my scalp super oily.
"
"
Not the results I had hoped for. Literally made my hair dry and brittle feeling.
"
"
Not worth the price at all. Difficult to get the product out of the bottle (squeezing). My hair felt just ""ok"" after using.
"
"
Waste of money
"
"
I had high hopes for this stuff! However, I don't feel like it gets my scalp or hair that clean. I normally have to wash my scalp with shampoo twice a week otherwise it gets itchy, and if I use this in place of shampoo, my scalp gets itchy within a day. It smells nice, my hair always seems to be nice and soft, and it has great slip, but it is not clarifying enough to use for my scalp.
"
"
Not a good product if you have hard water. Made it waaaaaay worse. Beside this, I usually love all the deva products.
"
"
This stuff works pretty well. It sort of helped my dandruff. My curls definitely don't feel quite as filmy. With the deva curl system this product is a must have because you will eventually get a lot of build up. I'm surprised they didn't come out with it sooner.
"
"
I usually love devacurl products but this didn't do what I thought it would
"
"
Okay I don't ever write reviews but after one use this product did magic to my thin 3B curls. I only use a cleanser twice a week because I get bad build up and my curls look blah. Well before his product I used redkin basic cleanser and it would strip my curls dry. After one use this product brought life to my curls they are light bouncy and VERY VERY SOFT. I followed with the deva curl conditioner and sprayed some deva curl set it free spray and damn to my curls look good. Would recommend this to anyone with thin curls that need a cleanser that doesn't strip.
"
"
Did not notice any difference between this and Suave shampoo build up remover. In fact, Suave brand works better for about $2.
"
"
I use DevaCurl products regularly, so when the Buildup Buster came out, I immediately got it. I've never been disappointed in any DC products I've used...until now.  The hype grossly exaggerates this product's actual performance. I've used this product a few times, and I honestly cannot feel or see any difference in my 2c/3a curls, except dryness. I used Heaven in a Jar to condition, but I still didn't like the way my hair felt or moved after using the Buildup Buster. I won't be repurchasing it.
"
"
I wasn't sure that I needed this, but I've been using the deva line for ages so I thought I'd give it a try. I often use whatever moisturizing thing I can get my hands on to tame frizz in my hair. Yes, this includes hand lotion in a pinch... don't judge. In retrospect, I think I really REALLY needed it. Once I was in the shower with wet hair, I had to apply it and rinse it three or four times before it finally lathered and rinsed clean. The first two tries didn't really result in that squeaky clean feeling. After the second wash I was doubting that it would work at all. Finally it started to lather up a bit and I could feel the sections of my hair that still needed extra cleansing. When I was satisfied that the product had actually busted the buildup, I conditioned with One Condition and styled with BeLeave In Curl Boost and Volumizer. My hair looks amazing. It's super soft and shiny, my curls are bouncy and thick, and even the color is better. I'm definitely holding on to this new cleansing product.
"
"
As a curly hair owner I totally recommend this product. I used yesterday and the experience was amazing. I was a bit about the price but it is totally worth it. Some people here are saying that better use the Suave brand. I was excited to try the Suave brand because of the good reviews and price obviously but when I read it has sulfate in it was a bit turn off. So definitely I'm sticking with this one for sure.
"
"
This product is amazing! Got rid of my itchy scalp due to buildup. I use it once a week...my scalp feels great and my hair is light and curls much better! Highly recommend!
"
"
It leaves a gray oily and gritty build up on my scalp after continued use
"
"
Love it
"
"
I have been a religious follower of the curly girl method upon discovering it on reddit and it has been a god send to my curls making me love them again. I recently moved to an area with significantly harder water than where I was previously living and it seemed like all hope had been lost. Then I read about this buildup buster and decided to try it out.To wash:- I wash my hair every other day or just about, sometimes I will push it to three days.- Shampoo - SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo- Conditioner - SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Conditionerabout once a week:- DevaCurl Buildup Buster in place of shampooand on another day of the week- Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner and leave it in for 15 minutes before rising it outTo style:- Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner about a dime size on damp hair- Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie- Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Hold & Shine Daily Moisture Mistif I wash my hair late at night I will plop it in an old tee shirt for the night and that is it. My hair has literally never had more life and moisture in it. It feels so unbelievably soft. Big fan of this build up buster and will be repurchasing in the future.
"
"
I detest DevaCurl products pretty much across the board. I think they are over priced, over hyped and under performing. When I first went to a DevaCurl salon, the stylist pushed over $150 worth of products, including this, on me and insisted that using the products was the ONLY way I would be able to maintain my DevaCut. Well, the cut was atrocious as was her personality and advice. All bulls*it. The cut was basically her shearing a few inches straight across the bottom of my hair, snipping the scissors around my head and loading my hair up with so many things that I could not get my fingers through it the next day. In addition, the products made my scalp itch and flake.A year later, after finding, using and thoroughly enjoying the InnerSense line, I found another DevaCurl salon that did not push the Deva line on customers. My hair was dry and the stylist at the new salon suggested I NOT co-wash every time I showered as even conditioner builds up on hair and can negatively effect curl pattern. She recommended the BuildUp Buster but did not insist I purchase it. When I got home, I discovered I had some unopened from the huge product purchase at the first DevaCurl salon.About a month after this haircut, I decided to try the BuildUp Buster since I use the InnerSense products nearly every day and also because I live in a hard water area and my silver hair is discolored from the minerals in the water.This is easy and pleasant to use, the scent is citrusy and it rinsed out very easily. I used a conditioning hair masque after and since I was home and had no plans for the day, just let my hair air dry with no other product in it. My curls were shiny, bouncy and springy, no frizz but also no change in the discoloration from the hard water. I think that is something I am just going to have to live with.I use BuildUp Buster every 4 to 6 weeks and find it really does remove excessive product from my curls and brings them back to life. How nice to find at least one DevaCurl product that does what it's supposed to do!
"
"
I have kinky/coily Afro hair. Supposedly one of the targets for devacurl products. Alas...I have NO idea why this happened, but when I used this product, it literally matted my hair. I was in the shower and could feel my hair matting up right away! I attempted to rinse it out, but it wouldn’t come out as it was still in the matted hair. I was HORRIFIED! I rinsed many times in an attempt to get it all out.Sad part, my hair matted so badly that I had to (insert intense sobbing) cut my hair. I mean, think of a dog that hasn’t been groomed in a year. I had THICK matted hair 😭 Well, my sister came down and cut out the matted hair for me. If you are a black woman with natural hair, you know how traumatic this was. I went from shoulder length twists one day to about 2 inches of hair, which I’m thankfully able to flat twist (but that’s about it for me until it grows more).The irony is that I purchased it to HELP my hair. I still need to contact the company. It’s been like 3 weeks now and I’m almost to the point where I’ve come to terms with what happened. I worked so hard for my hair.*** Here's the response I received from DevaCurl...Elicia G (Devacurl.com)Jan 17, 13:55 ESTHi Ardra,Thank you for contacting DevaCurl. My name is Elicia, and I am happy to assist you.I am so sorry to hear that Buildup Buster wasn't a great option for your hair.  I will forward your feedback to the Product Development team, as they need to see that this is something that our customers and clients are experiencing.I can say that with Buildup Buster, since it is so potent, it can have this affect if you apply it more than once. You can only use it one application per week.Thank you for choosing DevaCurl. Have a great weekend.Sincerely,Elicia

I love this shampoo! It gets my hair so clean and soft and keeps my hair so lovely for 3 days. I usually use it 1-2 times a week and mix it with my dandruff shampoo. A little goes a long way and I've been using the same 8oz bottle for 8 months. When my stylist used it on my hair, I just had to have a bottle because it gets my hair so clean and keeps it bouncy. We have hard water where we live, and I use a pretty heavy gel, and it gets everything out. It doesn't lather like a normal shampoo, but I promise it still gets your hair clean, because it makes my hair feel like silk when I'm rinsing it out. I don't have color-treated hair, so I'm not sure how it would work with that though.
"
"
If you have curly hair and use mouse or gel (or any hair products really) other than oils, YOU NEED THIS. Restored my hair completely by getting rid of all the junky product build up. I use weekly to keep my hair from feeling heavy. I watched YouTube videos on Deva curl styling gel, and this product was included. Couldn’t make myself pay over $40 in Ulta. Amazon saved me!

All I can say is this stuff really works. I use it, as well as my daughter, when we need an “extra cleansing”, and our hair literally feels sqeaky clean. The consistency is just like a serum. I do not use it once a week as suggested on the bottle, as I think it would be too drying for my hair. I can usually get away with using it every 3-4 weeks.
"

Awhile back I felt my hair was becoming increasingly dry and brittle. I was starting to have some hair fallout as well. A friend recommended DevaCurl products to me, including this Buildup Buster Micellar Water. I'm really starting to see improvements in my hair. I love how clean this makes my hair feel. It's simple to use, I use it just 2-3 times weekly in the shower.
"
"
I tried the build up buster after hearing it could help revive your curls if they are weighed down by build up...whoa was i wrong. I have waist length hair and a some of it just dried out and broke off and i have weird layers under my hair now.  when i used it, it wouldnt comb out no matter how much conditioner i used. anyway, i have a lot of short pieces where there is more strain to my hair and a lot more split ends... which sounds crazy but it really weakened it.  It really feels like chemicals stripped my hair, and also, my curls seem straighter and frizzier. Very disappointed. I feel like this ruined my hair.

My scalp will occasionally get a bit dry and/or seem to have some build up when I only use Deva Curl Conditioning Cleanser. I need something occasionally that I can rub into my scalp and get it cleaner. This does the trick. I use this probably every third time I wash my hair (which I do every other day, maybe every 3 days). It keeps my scalp very clean! The nozzle also makes it easy to apply the product directly onto the scalp between your hair.
"
"
This DevaCurl Buildup Buster smells wonderful! It seems to work well, although I've heeded the advice of using it weekly (NOT daily) as it may have a tendency to dry out your hair.The container has a cap that doubles as the applicator: you're supposed to direct the product at the roots, work it in, then rinse letting the rest of the hair get a somewhat diluted amount of Buildup Buster.I like the product because I tend to apply multiple DevaCurl products, layered and Buildup Buster seems to give my hair a ""clean slate"" especially in the summer humidity when I tend to retouch more often and create a build up.
"
"
I have semi curly, wavy hair that is also blonde. I was hoping this would help pull some of the hard water buildup out of my hair. I read the reviews and had high hopes, but it didn't seem to do that much. It doesn't bubble up either, so I feel like I have to use a lot for my thick hair. It's a nice shampoo, but not the the price, especially since there wasn't even a noticeable difference with my curls.
"
"
Very happy with this purchase. Not only is it cheaper than on the website, it works well and came quickly. I was worried because there was about an ounce missing, but they gave me a partial refund. I was assured it was authentic, and overall I'm very happy with this.  Will purchase again!
"
"
I like how my hair looks on the days I use this, and the smell for me is really nice and not overpowering. I used it a few days in a row and I think it was too much for my hair so I use it as recommended now which is less frequently. I am trying some normal shampoo now so I don't know if I will be buying this again but will see!
"
"
Really leaves hair clean but don't like the stringy dry feeling afterward. Gotta load up in the conditioner.
"
"
Was my hair cleaner- yes, was this s life changing product in any way- no! My hair felt just like I used regular sulfate-ful shampoo on it. Save your money.
"
"
This product worked very well, i have curly hair and I noticed some product build up even after washing my hair with shampoo, once I used this all over my hair it had a nice slick to it didn’t feel harsh on my hair. I get build up mostly in the back of my scalp and when I was done washing my hair I didn’t feel  any build up, no flakeyness nothing it felt so clean! Will be buying more once I’m done with this bottle!
"
"
I was skeptical of this product because I've never used any clarifying shampoo that worked nearly as well as Neutrogena clarifying does. Hey, guess what - DevaCurl Build Up Buster is excellent! It de-gunks my hair without drying it out or stripping the color. I recommend.
"
"
Was looking forward to using this product. I’m a huge fan of Deva but not this one unfortunately. This left my hair feeling very dried out. I was really surprised. I read this before I purchased this but everyone’s experience is different but not for me. I’ll stick to Mop Top
"
"
It a shampoo to clarify and remove product so moisturizing is not what it’s for.  The scent is fine, the price is ridiculous, but I’m regrowing my curls out and don’t want to use a shampoo not meant for curls.  It does the job and doesn’t strip my scalp and leaves my curls looking good.
"
"
My fellow curl girlfriend recommended a cleanser. My scalp was itchy, my hair felt weighed down and my hair was frizzy. When I used this product, it was an instant success. I was skeptical at first because I didn't want a cleanser that stripped my hair of moisture or oils. I've trusted Deva products before though and this one did not disappoint!
"
"
This is great for removing product build up from your hair. I use it about once a month when my hair feels like it’s gotten kind of gunky.  I follow it with a deep conditioner and then my hair feels really clean and refreshed.  Just don’t over use it as over use will strip your hair
"
"
It really refreshes your curls! LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell! It even lingers with a DC conditioner and leave in products thankfully. So clean feeling and smelling.
"
"
I have come to love Devacurl, all its products are great. This one left my hair really clean and soft, I didn't feel it brittle or dry as with other cleansers. LOVE IT!
"
"
This product works.  My hair gets curlier every time I use it. It does seem somewhat harsh though.  I use conditioners only to wash and this seems like a rather harsh shampoo.  I use once every six washes so I cut down on the stripping nature of the product - which is its intention to get build up and hard water residue out.  I recommend it with that caution.
"
"
Smells amazing and works great! I have very thick wavy middle eastern hair and after years of dying, treatments, and products this did the trick! I’ve tried other clarifying products and they dried out my hair really bad. DC booster left my hair luxurious and restored.
"
"
Careful, it strips your hair. I use it only on my roots and only when necessary.
"
"
Works great! Smells ok nothing to complain about and got all the crap off my scalp from all the nasty conditioners I used to use!
"
"
Great. I use 1x or 2x a month on my curls. I follow with a deep conditioner. Brings life into my hair
"
"
Great product. It got rid of all the build up. Left my hair manageable. Will order again.
"
"
Not cheap but does gently remove buildup and does leave hair feeling like straw afterwards. Also a lot goes on long way.
"
"
It works.  Taking the residue off your hair.
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Smells good. Can't really tell if it works or not though to be honest
"
"
Use once a week for my zero porosity hair and its has totally changed the look and feel of my hair in the best way!
"
"
Very nice
"
"
This stuff really works to remove buildup in hair!
"
"
I have found this to be as cleansing as plain water. Very disppointed
"
"
Love!
"
"
It's not meant to be a moisturizer. It is definitely a cleanser and it works very well.
"
"
I was really looking forward to using this product, I really like the line. But I used it and broke out in hives all over after using it! I’m pretty bummed about it.Must be allergic to something in it?
"
"
I love the build up buster! It is a nice refresher to keep my hair looking healthy and curly!I can immediately tell how clean my hair is after I use this product!
"
"
I use this every week to 2 weeks depending on how my hair feels. I wash my hair every day and use all Deva Curl products(shampoo/conditioner/styling cream).  This just really helps re-set my hair when it gets too much build up.
"
"
I didnt really see a huge difference between using this and the regular shampoo
"
"
Works great. Gives me the best curls.
"
"
Great buy and worked like a charm on my hair
"
"
Item as described...Thank you
"
"
My curls are super bouncy and shiny I got days with perfect curls!
"
"
Disappointing. I prefer soma clarifying and I'm a dedicated deva customer.
"
"
Took less than I thought it would to cleanse my thick hair.
"
"
Awesome!
"
"
Deep cleansing for people who does low shampoo technique
"
"
Cleans the build up from using the conditioner but still gives my hair curl. Much prefer this product to the No Poo.
"
"
it helps with build up
"
"
I use all of the Devacurl products but not a fan of this. My hair is very dry and curly. This product made my hair very stiff and not soft. Do not recommend but I love the other products.
"
"
It really rids my hair of excess product
"
"
Has completely changed my hair. A great weekly help for my scalp and helps keep my frizz at bay. Definitely worth a try!
"
"
Worked well - my curls are much happier. After reading other reviews I was concerned it would dry out my hair so I also ordered a silicone free conditioning mask and did it right after. Feels great, and my hair is shinier and bouncier.
"
"
This made my hair feel really dry even after deep conditioning.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have protein-sensitive hair like me, but it probably works well for other hair types.
"
"
I live all Deva products. I try this one for the first time and really enjoyed, but make sure to wash your hair first if you need an extra cleaning boost. I use Deva shampoo as well.
"
"
Works well, my curls are nice and 'springy' after use!
"
"
I love Devacurl and their products have rejuvenated my curls so I was so excited to try this product, especially after seeing all the raves reviews.  It makes me wonder if people really do like it or if it's just all hype because I literally saw no difference in my hair. My curls didn't ""bounce back"" nor did it feel like it clarified much of anything. Perhaps I don't have as much buildup as everyone else? I'm not really sure. I applied it as directed, which is super easy to do as the little pointed spout really helps target the scalp. The liquid itself is thick and takes some time to work into the hair/scalp. It smells great as most Devacurl products do. It just didn't seem to work for me. For reference, I have 2c/3a fine/normal waves/curls.
"
"
I'm so confused by all the glowing reviews for this product. I was so excited to try it, but it has not met ANY of my expectations for a ""buildup buster"". I've tried using it several times now, with the hope that I can make it work for me, but every time it fails: my hair is heavy and weighed down, greasy (especially the roots), stringy, zero body, and it takes forever to dry. Ironically, it feels dirtier than ever, and I need something to washout the massive buildup this leaves behind. I massage it in and then spend ages trying to make sure it's rinsed out, but nothing works. My hair is normally wavy in the drier months, very curly in the more humid months, thick, and with lots of natural body, for reference. Clearly, I'm the lone dissenter here (though there are other reviews outside this site with similar experiences), and I just don't get it. There's none of the ""lightness"" or ""bounce"" that others have described, and my curls are less defined than ever...flatter than flat. I love all my other DevaCurl products, which I use regularly, but I just can't get behind this one. Going into the trash and will never be repurchased.
"
"
I have lost tons of hair and length using Devacurl products. It fried my super long curly hair so badly and the company won’t reply to me about it. I’ve had approx 8-10 inches in places just break off. My hair is absolutely ruined. Unbelievable :-/ very sad and distrought.Beware if you have very long colored or fragile hair.
"
"
I LOVE this! I've been using only Deva Curl products for a year now and when this came out I had to try it. I use a lot of leave in Set it Free, their gels and creams, etc daily and at first when I used it I thought I'd have a horrible hair day... Nope! My hair air dried so nice and wavy and it smells AMAZING. Even my husband commented on my ""new"" smell. I don't think it smells citrusy one bit like the other reviewer said.
"
"
I suffer from scalp build up/dandruff/psoriasis and this saved my life. I have natural straight fine/thin hair, but a lot of it and this product works perfect for my hair type. I got a perm 5 months ago that has definitely went away, but everytime I use this I feel like I get some of that perm bounce and curliness back. My scalp loves me after I use this. I would be careful about using this more than a few times per week as it can be somewhat stripping if you're not moisturizing afterwards. Thanks DevaCurl.
"
"
Does the cleaning job well although I can't tell a big difference between this one and a regular shampoo. However, this product smells amazing and the smell stays with you for the day. I will buy again just for the smell of it.
"
"
This makes my hair feel very clean.
"
"
Need a bigger bottle go through it pretty quickly. Smells nice.

I have thick, curly hair and have been a deva products purchaser for 15 years.  I have purchased all of the products, the hair dryer, and Lorraine Massey's books.  I've had my hair cut, multiple times, at a deva salon in NY (fantastic hair cuts!).  Deva products, sadly, dry out my hair and are full of toxic chemicals.  Low poo contains diazolidinyl urea, fragrance, peg-75 lanolin and ped-7 glyceryl.  I've recently tried shea moisture products and have been so pleased with the resulting soft, natural, bouncing curls.  Deva products were purchased by L'Oreal a couple of year ago.  I'm sure they wanted to kill them so they couldn't compete with their products.  I just discovered that Shea Moisture/Sundial was bought out by Dove, so I am expecting more chemicals and possible loss of the product.  I'm weaning off of all deva products and will continue my search for fewer toxic chemicals and clean, soft curls.  I wasn't paid or given free products for this review!
"
"
Be careful with counterfeit I sent back all my deva curl products from amazon they itched my head and made my scalp dry after 2 weeks of using the product. I then went and bought it directly from deva curl and the issue went away. Don't be cheap buy from deva curl directly they give you a lot of free things when you order from them.

I have low porosity mostly 3A Caucasian hair that is extremely dry and tends to frizz.  Tried various different co-wash and no-poo methods and my hair was still always dry.  I initially assumed my hair was very porous because it was rough and fuzzy, once I learned how to actually tell it wasn't very porous at all, I found out that low porosity hair needs the buildup removed in order to accept moisture at all.  This shampoo has done a very nice job of that for me, it cleans my hair but doesn't leave it feeling as though it's been stripped.  Most other shampoos (and I've tried a lot) leave my hair feeling rough, and it's really hard to find one without silicones and various proteins.  The citrus smell of this shampoo is pleasant as well.  Used with the DevaCurl One Decadence conditioner, my hair feels and looks the best it has in years.  As a sidenote: my hair absolutely hates keratin and most other proteins, but the hydrolyzed quinoa protein in the conditioner does not seem to bother it. This stuff isn't cheap compared to most shampoos, but it's worth it to me.-Updating nearly a year later to add that at some point, the protein in the conditioner became too much.  I have since found Shea Moisture Low Porosity conditioner and it is the best I have ever found.  I use it with the Deva Low Poo cleanser.
"
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32ozI was hoping that this would leave less of a buildup than the  Devacurl No-Poo Original (Conditioner) Cleanser, but sadly it does not.  It leaves the roots of my hair feeling extremely weighted and slightly greasy looking.  I was looking for something more natural that didn't weigh my hair down, but I am afraid this is not the product I was looking for.
"
"
I don't have curly hair. Actually, my hair is about as straight as hair can get. I do have curly hair in my family, but it missed me. About a year ago, I was looking up shampoo with the least amount of harmful chemicals. This was one that came up on several lists. So, I tried it out and fell in love. I have somewhat oily hair after not washing it for more than 24 hours. I hate taking a shower every day because it dries my skin out. Most conventional shampoos not only make my hair crazy, but it makes my skin ""itch"". I call it alligator skin. :)  But, this shampoo is gently for both my hair and my skin. A 16 oz bottle lasted me 1 year +, because I only use it once a week, maybe 5-6 times a month. I have mid-back length think hair, and only need a quarter or two sized amount- half the amount of conventional shampoo. I actually like my hair better the second day after using this product.So, if you are looking for a gently shampoo with fewer chemicals, give this one a try.
"
"
It really worked on no frizz curls (I have med curly grey hair tends to frizz)... but I did not like the 'dirty' feel & dull look after a half dozen washes. I've talked with friends who have super curly/kinky hair and they do not mind the texture change as much. I switched to another no sulfate shampoo, that, coupled w a good beachy hair lotion did the trick.
"
"
I really do not like writing negative reviews but this stuff has made my hair so grossl. It smells great but it does not clean AT ALL. My hair (medium, wavy) is so incredibly greasy despite that I am a regular washer (at least 4 times a week). I thought that I needed to let it adjust or something, but after several weeks of using this, I am going to return it and get my money back. I know tons of people who love deva curl, but for some reason, this stuff is really not doing the trick for my hair.

I used to dread them and plan my life accordingly but I don't have to do that with this shampoo and conditioner. I do follow with all DC products and my curls love it!

It arrived not wrapped in anything to indicate that it's new. The top appeared to have been opened before. I don't trust it enough to use it. The picture shows what an actually new item looks like on the right and what I received on the left.
"
"
Not good for anyone who actually works up a sweat when they work out - hair never felt clean with this product.Totally ineffective for removing build up. Hair was left flat and oily at the roots. Ended up using a 'clarifying' wash most weeks and in the end, I was thinking, what's the point?

This is my first Deva Curl product. I found it by chance on amazon while searching desperately for the next shampoo to try. I also discovered the Curly Girl book, which helps a lot. If you have a curly or wavy hair and have never used these products, my suggestion is to get the book first and choose your routine, regardless of whether you plan to use the Deva Curls products or not. My hair is wavy on the curly side. Ever since I started dyeing it to cover the gray hair, it got very dry. Looks like I have to use conditioner every time. This shampoo alleviates the problem a little - it is not as drying as the others sulfate-free products I have used. I am looking forward to try the no-poo shampoo next, as well as the conditioner (the Deva conditioner can be left in the hair if needed depending on the hair dryness).
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl products since 2006 with great results. Low-Poo, No-Poo and One Condition have been my go to. The company has been sold 3 times since then and apparently has added some toxic chemistry to their products. In the last several years, I have noticed severe hair loss at my scalp and my hairline. My hair used to be so thick that hairdressers joked that they'd have to sharpen their scissors after my haircut. My hair is now so thin, I can see my head and my curls don't last beyond the first day and turn into fuzz and frizz where there used to be curls. My hair used to be healthy and grew fast. I haven't had a haircut in 3 years and my hair does not seem to be growing. My diet is excellent and I feel fine. This product sucks and has damaged my hair and a whole community of former DevaCurl users. There are a few Facebook groups with horrible stories of what's happening to them because of DevaCurl's products. One group has over 11,000 members
"
"
I thought sulfate free shampoo is good, but my stylist told me, “what’s the point?” I should’ve listened because you have to wash a few times to get your hair cleaned. At first, you wouldn’t know the difference in a clean scalp. It’s something to take for granted, until you’re scalp gets sticky and you don’t understand why it’s still sticky after three washes. You can develop dandruff or bacteria/fungus on your scalp if you don’t wash a few times in one sitting. Eventually, I threw it away.
"
"
First off let me tell you a little about my locks. I have mid back length, fine curly hair but lots of it. Curly on the bottom, with waves from the scalp for the rest. I do not color or otherwise try to alter my curls. I have spent years trying this and that ""fabulous"" salon, non ""fabulous"" organic blah blah, dermatologist recommended, more blah blah shampoo than me or my wallet cares to think about. I have never found anything that compares to this product. I use to have horrible itchy, tight, burning scalp. No more. One wash every three days, no itching. My scalp problems were finally attributed to P.C.O.S for any of you girls out there that may also have this little problem. Try this product, it really is worth a shot, dealing with hair loss is bad enough for a woman. Never mind having to deal with all the other itching and dandruff problems too. A million stars to Deva Curl, Thank you.
"
"
Terrible smell. Does not smell like the normal Devacurl products. As a customer for ten years of devacurl I’ve never had this issue. Seller was czbrm.
"
"
I bought this in July of 2018. About a week into using it I noticed my hair completely changed. My hair was shedding all the time and looked unhealthy. I’m guessing this was a fake. My hair has never changed before. Ever since then even after discontinuing using this product my hair is still shedding/coming out. Wish I never bought. :(
"
"
I purchased the low poo original but received the low poo delight. The delight doesn't leave my hair feeling clean... so disappointed!
"
"
My curls are finally free!  This shampoo has helped my hair feel more healthy than ever. I have S-curl type hair, layered cut and moderately short.  I have been using this shampoo for a year and see a big difference in how my curls lay and feel.  I don't use a hair dryer anymore and just scrunch my hair with my fingers and air dry.  This was a new experience for me but the dryer was drying out my hair (along with menopause) and I really thought I was losing my curl. Then I found Curly Girl website and learned a lot about my hair type and how curly hair should be taken care of.  Ordered the shampoo, which on Amazon is a lot less than in a salon, and started the journey of rediscovering my curls!  What a difference!  I even have curly hair in the cold winter, whereas before, it would be flat and lifeless.  Great shampoo! Just ordered the 32 oz. pump bottle.
"
"
I love that DevaCurl Low Poo leaves my hair feeling moisturized after washing....unlike most typical shampoos that make your hair feel stripped of its natural oils and really dry afterwards.
"
"
Maybe some people don't need real shampoo, but after using this I know I do. This ""cleanser"" didn't make my hair feel clean; my scalp was greasy the same day that I washed it with this, and the next day I would get pimples on my scalp. I really gave the product a try because my hair is curly and dry, but after using a third of the bottle I'm getting rid of it and buying real shampoo!
"
"
Switched from the no poo to the low poo recently for my curly headed kid and i love this. I dont notice her hair being any dryer with the low poo vs no poo but its easier for her to wash her hair by herself since there is a bit of a lather and its easier to work into her curls
"

About 6 years ago, my straight hair began turning very wavy and on the verge of curly.  I had no idea how to tame the curls and frizz so I did a little research and learned about curly hair from a few knowledgeable websites.  I spent quite a bit on different shampoos and conditioners before finding this little jewel.  I love this stuff!  It lathers just a tiny bit (could be because I add a little avocado or coconut oil to the mix sometimes), but my hair feels incredibly soft and controllable after shampooing.  I take it with me whenever I travel.  Oh, and this stuff lasts along time and, because I often add oil to the mix, it really extends the product.  Great stuff!

Deva would do well to change their packaging colors for their different products. I've made this mistake twice now and gotten ""Low-Poo"" instead of ""No-Poo"". The ""Low-Poo"" doesn't smell good to me, and the rest of the family also seems to vastly prefer the ""No-Poo"" product.Other than that, it works great.
"
"
I absolutely love this product so the star rating is not because of the quality of the product but when I received it the top was halfway off and there was shampoo all over the box, the packing paper, bubble wrap and the bottle.  No damage to the box whatsoever.
"
"
My favorite shampoo. I’ve been using it for years and every stylist I’ve had has commented on the health of my curly hair.
"
"
This is my favorite shampoo as it is so gentle but also cleans my hair without the harsh chemicals. I love Low-Poo Shampoo and their Decadence Conditioner. They both leave my hair soft and silky. I have been using DevaCurl for a couple of years now and they have yet to disappoint me.
"
"
This was supposed to be a great product and i had my hopes set high. But it made my scalp very itchy.  I noticed when using any deva curl products that i wiuld loose about 4-5x the hair that i normally do while showering. So i discontinued use.
"
"
I am a total DevaCurl devotee. Until I found this product line I was always fighting my curls (read: my frizz) and wishing I had straight hair. However, with the shampoo, conditioner and sometimes the gel, I have great hair days all the time. People are constantly stopping me and asking ""Is your hair naturally like that??"" Anyone with curly hair will be able to relate to how crazy it makes you look when you can't get it to behave, but these products are magic. I wish they were cheaper, but I'm so happy with the result I don't mind paying more.
"
"
Recently switched to the curly girl method and after trying a few different low-poos/co-washes, I realized this one is the best for my hair!
"
"
I have mildly curly hair and live by DEVA products.
"
"
Once you've adjusted to the DevaCurl line of products, it's very hard to switch back to ""normal"" shampoos, even those specifically  marketed for curly or wavy hair. My hair consistently looks good when I'm using this line of products and I notice a huge difference if I use a regular shampoo (for example, when I've forgotten to bring the Low-Poo while traveling!).
"
"
So as I got older my hair ends just were not holding up to daily shampoo.  My hair is too fine to not shampoo daily.  This product is perfect to clean my hair daily, while not wearing it out like shampoo would.  Just a bit of lather is great.
"
"
Great for cowashing wigs. I love it!
"
"
I like this brand, but unfortunately this particular item I believe was an older shampoo that Amazon now sells. Had an odd smell from the original one and bottle looked best up.
"
"
Wifey bought the shampoo and the  conditioner for our daughter.  Works great.  Nice scent.Daughter is an exotic...HAHAHA!!! half black half Korean. Shampoo treats her curls well.
"
"
Excellent product for those of us with curly hair. Maintains natural curl without any frizz. I've been using it for years and recommend it highly. Somewhat expensive but worth it.
"
"
I have low porosity, fine-medium, wavy 2B hair. This low poo still weighs me down. So heavy, no matter how hard I scrub/lather or the amount I use, it still stretches my waves/curls and makes my hair feel unclean. I'm not even using it to get rid of it, I really just want to throw it out. NOT good especially for the price!
"
"
Thanks
"
"
Switched from Deva wavy products. Thinking this was similar. Smells completely different and dried out my hair badly. My hair went from soft moisturized waves to a frizzy mess. Going to buy the wavy hair set. Waste of money.
"
"
My favorite shampoo, have been using it for about a year.  I have keratin treated hair and need shampoo that is Sodium and Sulfate free products and this one fits the bill.
"
"
I've been using this product for 1 year now and love it. It is wheat-free (which not all DevaCurl products are).  Price is very competitive so I keep buying it here. This is a large salon-size jug, but I like it like that since it's the only shampoo I use.  Plus, having the pump makes dispensing it easy.I strive to provide useful reviews, so it this was helpful to you, please give my review a thumbs up :)
"
"
Works great for my purple hair. I’ve been using this shampoo for a year and it keeps my purple vivid the longest.
"
"
The first time I used this shampoo it felt like my scalp was being burned. It felt acidic. I don't really know how else to describe it because I've never felt anything like it. The closest feeling is cutting hot peppers and the burn on your skin. It was awful. I will be throwing the bottle away.
"
"
Perfect for curly/wavy hair. I have 2c/3a hair, I use mainly deva curl products because they smell great, last a long time and make my hair happy!
"
"
Love the product, have used for years. Unfortunately it leaked in the box, so I did not get a full bottle that I paid for. I don’t have time to return it.
"
"
I started doing the curly girl method and this shampoo is amazing. I bought it about 4 months ago and I still have so much left. It smells pretty good and cleans my hair well. Also so much cheaper here than in store!!!
"
"
I have always tried to buy Deva products through Amazon--and they always arrive leaking!!!!The boxes are always dry, but the bottle caps arrive loose, the bags they are in are soaking, and mucky, sticky with product! Deva needs to get their people's acts together!
"
"
This is very gentle for my curly hair. I've been using it for years.
"
"
Good
"
"
Love, love, love this shampoo on my white girl 3B curls! I’ve actually been using it for a while, but just recently discovered it’s cheaper on Amazon than at Ulta lol.
"
"
This does not dry out my hair like shampoos with ""sudsers."" It takes getting used to no suds but it works.  The end result is that my natural waves have a chance to show.
"
"
I love this shampoo.  Great for curly hair and though I'm allergic to so many products I've had no issues.  Also love conditioner and gel.
"
"
This was my first bottle and my hair is so much better for having used this for several weeks! Will be purchasing more later!
"
"
I like the idea of not using a harsh cleanser on my hair.
"
"
Liking product! That’s how I received! I discount would be fair!!!!
"
"
Love the smell and the way my daughters hair looks when paired with deva curl conditioner!
"
"
Works fine, won’t repurchase because of the price point
"
"
I have very curly hair. The first time  used DevaCurl products I was hooked! My hair has never looked better and my curls have the definition I always wished for. This is a must-have for anyone with curls!
"
"
I tried this shampoo on recommendation from a friend who suspected it would make my hair wavy instead of in-between straight and wavy.  She was right, but the waves only hold for a few hours, sadly.  I have medium-think hair and a naturally oily scalp, and this shampoo doesn't get my hair clean even after using it for 1.5 months.  I'll keep looking for another product to make my hair hold waves... but sadly this wasn't it.
"
"
Like sets hair clean yet not stripped of oils. I use it only when needed. Then condition my hair heavily.
"
"
washes and does good job
"
"
Shampoo leaked all through the bag
"
"
I've used DevaCurl low-poo cleanser for over a year now.  I wash my hair every three days.  It is naturally curly and fine.  I love this shampoo and am so glad it was recommended to me by a hair stylist.  I also use the conditioner on the ends of my long hair.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
love this product- if you have curly hair and you try this you will never buy another shampoo/conditioner again!
"
"
Great shampoo for curly hair! For my type of hair I prefer this to the No Poo. The fact that it lathers a little more helps me get a better clean.
"
"
Fake!! Totally not a real Deva product. Save your money!
"
"
Love it for the curls
"
"
I have 2c curly hair and I've had problems with frizz and dryness and my hair flattening out within 8 hours of washing it. I've been using this every day since I got it (almost two weeks) and I have not had a bad hair day since I gave up dove and pantene. My hair feels SO healthy and people have been commenting on how shiny it is which is a comment I've never received before now. I could go with washing it every other day but I don't need to because my hair doesn't feel dry or damaged at all after washing, in fact exactly the opposite. And I love the smell! I literally just can't get over how perfect low poo is for my hair. I wish I'd found it years ago.Update: haven't used anything else for three years. will never go back to regular shampoo.
"
"
Great product for very curly hair
"
"
As someone with curly hair, this shampoo is perfect for me. Doesn't dry hair and leaves them frizz free.I do have to use my normal shampoo after 2-3 days coz i don't feel this cleans hair efficiently. I'm trying to combine both shampoos now. Seems to be working fine for now.
"
"
The product is great. The label is different which leads me to believe it is older that what I expected.
"
"
Shampoo did not clean my hair and left it  limp and lifeless after styling.
"
"
Didn’t like this one as much as the no-poo, probably won’t order again, but does have a nice smell
"
"
Love this product. Washed my hair but it still feels soft and moisturizer when I rinse.
"
"
If you have type 3a/b dyed curly hair than this is you shampoo. I am using it sometimes without having to use a conditioner! It is that good!
"
"
Awesome shampoo, one of my FAVES!!!! I don't have curly hair but I have fine thin hair and this doesn't weigh it down like other shampoos.
"
"
I love this shampoo but last time I ordered, it had leaked a bunch. Luckily it was in a plastic bag inside the box but it’s expensive so I don’t want to lose any.
"
"
Excellent for curly hair.
"
"
This is a quality product with a lovely smell
"
"
Love this!
"
"
The bottle had opened and leaked through the packaging box
"
"
My husband has very curly hair and will only use deva products. I think the shampoo is great. It really smooths out his curls, his hair never looks frizzy, just smooth defined curls.
"
"
Smells great and does not dry out my hair. I did find I needed quite a bit to really get my scalp clean.
"
"
Worst smelling product I have ever used.  I bought anew bottle at the store and what a total difference.  I am not sure what I bought online but it was horrible!!!!
"
"
Love the smell. It is a bit on the expensive side but works well. Good choice for natural curls
"
"
I’ve purchased this same shampoo in stores and it’s worked wonders for my hair and scalp. I ordered online and what I got smells legit like plastic.
"
"
Outstanding product.
"
"
A mild but effective shampoo.
"
"
Cap was almost off and the product was leaking into plastic containment bag.I was told NOT to return the leaking item.
"
"
If you want to do the curly girl method but need a little lather this is the stuff for you!
"
"
I heart devacurl products. They have a good rating on the website that rates toxicity of products and smells good too :)
"
"
I have been using this product for several years and love it!  It has brought out the natural curl in my hair.  I only use DevaCurl products.
"
"
Love this product!  This time it came with the cap not screwed on tight so I lost about 5oz in the plastic wrap:-(
"
"
After reading the Curly Girl Handbook, I decided to give this shampoo a try. I think the combination of the no-poo shampoo and conditioner are a great duo.  I've noticed a difference in my extremely curly hair.  It is in much better condition since using these products.
"
"
My low poo shampoo leaked upon delivery.  Lost a little product, but it looks like the pump is broken also!  Very disappointed!
"
"
Love this product. I’ve been using Deva Curl for probably a little over a year. My hair is so soft and healthy. I’ve used other products to compare and my hair reacts best with this line!
"
"
My shampoo came opened and there was goopy liquid all over the outside of the bottle. Also the pump mechanism doesn’t work. :(
"
"
as expected
"
"
Hairdresser recommended this product. Keeps curls shiny and moisturized. A bit pricey but works really well.
"
"
Excellent for my permed hair.  I was introduced to Deva Curl Nya lady with gorgeous natural curls.  This shampoo, One Condition, and the styling cream work wonders in my permed hair. Soft but strong curls.
"
"
Arrival was delayed but I eventually got it. Happy with it.
"
"
Love ♥️This Shampoo! My favorite for long curly hair 🌟🌟🌟
"
"
Great for curly hair!
"
"
If I only knew about this product and their line of products years ago!!! The very best!
"
"
This shampoo is one of the best noncolor, nonchemical out there.  I recommend this to anyone who needs a natural product.
"
"
A great cleanser; doesn’t  strip my hair.
"
"
I use this shampoo once or twice a week but condition every day. This shampoo is creamy and washes out clean. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I've found.
"
"
Product was in a used, unsealed bottle with a poorly faked label. Product smelled nothing like DevaCurl Low-Poo.
"
"
This is not deva curl. It's a counterfeit. :(
"
"
Gentle on your hair with just a bit of the 'suds' I need to really feel like my hair is clean.  Great for curly, frizzy hair.
"
"
My hair has never looked better since I started using this shampoo and companion conditioner. Whenever I have to use something else, my hair looks like crap. This stuff is magic, a must have for curly girls.
"
"
Do NOT buy this product! Your HAIR WILL FALL OUT!!!
"
"
I was born with wavy/curly hair had had nothing but problems trying to make it look presentable and nothing I did worked.  I blew dry trying to make it straight, but that just damaged my hair. As I got older my hair started to thin some and made it even worse.  I decided to let it grow natural, but couldn't find a product that would give my curls a natural look without weighing them down until I found Deva Curl Low Poo Shampoo and it's companion products. This shampoo cleans but does not strip the hair of its moisture. So I use it and their Conditioner plus their ArcGel and my hair looks great.
"
"
Love this product. Does exactly as it claims
"
"
Great if you aren't willing to go completely ""no poo"". Can't be the price as its almost 50% off of other retailers.
"
"
Works great on my natural Curley hair
"
"
I love this product, and I didn't have any problems with the 12 oz bottle because it just has a lid. But the packaging on the 32 oz bottle (which has a pump) was pathetic. The only protection it had was a single piece of tape across the top. It was shipped with other items, including some electronics, which had shampoo all over them when they arrived. Fortunately nothing was damaged, but it definitely could have been. Also, about an inch of the bottle had come out... Very displeasing. There needs to be extra protection in these shipments.
"
"
As a faithful user of No Poo, I was craving some suds in my hair and a stylist told me about this. Yes, it does give me suds and works well, but the ungodly smell is strong and I can only liken it to Super Glue. Nothing like the sweet smell of No Poo. Sorry I bought 32 oz, but will not be buying this again.
"
"
The only shampoo I'll let near my curls.
"
"
My hairdresser warned me that buying hair product online could be bad and I took the risk anyway. Was short on time and needed more product. I've been using DevaCurl for several years so I know how my curly hair should react to this product.  After using this product my curls were lifeless. The correct substance gives my curls bounce.  I got a sample of the same shampoo from my hairdresser and the consistency is different than the shampoo purchased online. One of the many reasons I love this line of hair product is because it does not effect my ears. Almost all other hair product causes my ears to itch.  I knew this wasn't the true product b/c my ears starting itching right away which lead to a very bad ear infection.  Three solid reasons to NOT buy this product. Only buy name brand products in a salon or reputable hair supply distributor.
"
"
love this deva curl product!  brings our my natural curls.  i also use the one conditioner by deva curl.  shipping was fast.  thank you!
"
"
This is a great shampoo if you do not mind that it does not lather much at all. I have really curly hair that dries out but when I use this with the conditioner it seems to keep my hair hydrated pretty well and gets my hair clean. My curls are bouncy afterward so I know it does not leave a heavy residue and rinses out well. I also have color treated hair and this shampoo seems to make the color last longer. It smells nice and is made from some natural ingredients which I find important for my health and my hair. My only problem is that I feel like there is not enough in my hair because it does not lather much at all. If this is what you are looking for it is a great shampoo.
"
"
The pump was broken when it arrived, but the product was just what I wanted.
"
"
I use this lo poo shampoo occasionally because it is sulfate free and was recommended by my stylist. It has a pleasant smell.
"
"
I know this product is supposed to be for people with curly hair, but I just had to give it a try.  I have long, straight hair.  A hair stylist told a friend of mine with short straight hair that Deva Curl products would make her hair curl.  She tried it and it worked. It gave her waves and body.  So, I had to give it a try.  I have hair where a couple pieces curl in the rain but that's about it.  I bought Deva Curl Low Poo, Deva Curl One Conditioner, and Deva Care Arc Angel Gel.  After using the cleanser and conditioner, I dried my hair with a towel and combed it out.  I could see waves starting to happen.  I scrunched it the Arc Angel Gel, and I had waves and body.  I really couldn't believe it.The problem is that I didn't feel like it got my hair very clean.  I like shampoo that leaves your hair squeaky clean, and this product does not do that.  This cleanser, Low Poo, only suds a little.  I never felt my hair have that clean feeling when I was washing it, but it could just be me.  I've had that issue with several shampoos because they don't give the squeaky clean feeling.  I wouldn't let that discourage you.  Every one is different.They make a No Poo that doesn't suds at all.  I've tried Wen products and felt that they made my hair too flat and oily the next day.  In that aspect, Deva Curl is similar.  The day I first washed it, it had a lot of body and looked pretty good.  It gives it that wind-blown messy look.  The second day, it was tangled and oily looking.  So, if you are like me and only wash every other day, you will have to wash every day with this product.  Overall, I don't regret buying it.  I will use it for days when I want a different look, but I will just have to expect to wash it the next day.
"
"
Love this shampoo! Doesn't dry out my hair and my curls have  bounce.
"
"
shampoo.  He has very curly hair and I was sick of it getting frizzy so he embraced his curls and now uses this shampoo.
"
"
My hair looked dry and damaged before I started using Deva Curl Low Poo..Now it feels great and looks shiny! Will continue to buy this product!
"
"
Love this stuff! Bouncy soft curls follow where this product goes!
"
"
not crazy about the product
"
"
A wonderful shampoo for wavy to curly hair.  Does not weigh hair down and my hair is soft and silky.
"
"
Cleansing shampoo without overwhelming suds.  Encourages existing waves or curls.  I'll buy it again!
"
"
Dry Hair
"
"
I've been using for several years, a must for curly hair but great for all hair types.
"
"
I have used this for years... and love it.
"
"
Love this low poo for my permed hair!
"
"
the product is what i expected
"
"
I like that it cleans the product out of my hair without stripping away the moisture.
"
"
I don't believe this is the real product
"
"
Thank you
"
"
A must have for curly hair
"
"
Works as description says.
"
"
My daughter and I have been using this shampoo for about a year and love it. We also use the conditioner and gel made by Deva to get the full curly effect and have been really impressed by how well it works.
"
"
I have fine waves hair that tangles easily.  This shampoo cleans and de-tangles all in one, and leaves my hair easy to style.  After using this, it's hard to use regular shampoo and conditioner!
"
"
Love Deva Curl products! This shampoo has a very slight lather compared to No Poo having none.
"
"
Great cleanser that doesn't strip dry out your hair.
"
"
Terrible chemical smell but works well
"
"
not a fan, doesn't cleanse ad good as I'd like it to..
"
"
I'm a repeat user of this product. Love it!
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Best products ever!!!
"
"
Great product at great price
"
"
I use this daily- love Deval Curl
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
I was introducted to Deva Curl products a few months ago and have been hooked ever since.  Never knew my hair could look so good.
"
"
Love my rejuvenated curly hair with this shampoo! Find the accompanying technique in the book ""Curly Girl"" by Lorraine Massey. Naturally curly/frizzy girls -- it will change your LIFE!!!
"
"
Love it. It doesn't dry  or frizz my curly hair. I recommend this product.
"
"
This product went moldy after using only half a bottle.  That's $18 down the drain!!  No way I'm investing in this product again.  A hair stylist recommended I invest in this product for my curly hair.  It cleans my hair but that's about it!  I never noticed, within the 6-8 months I've used it, any difference in my curls.  In warm weather and cold.  What a waste of my money.
"
"
Deva Curls is the perfect product for my hair. It leaves it extra soft and manageable without having to use any kind of conditioner. I love it and probably will use it forever.
"
"
I have used this product for years and this is the first bad product I have received.  Beware I don't believe this is the real product!!
"
"
I have dry curly/wavy hair and I try to use No poo on my ends and Low poo on my scalp.  This combo keeps my dry hair from overdrying.  I also use one condition (conditioner) and will also use it as a leave in conditioner.  I really like the whole combo of the products
"
"
Love all the Deva products I use on my curly hair.
"
"
Has a nice lather, and smells nice.  Not very impressed, may but if I can get it on sale, I'll buy it again
"
"
Great Product!  A must have, do I need to say more?
"
"
best curly shampoo ever
"
"
Just a heads up to others, this is the original low-poo formula not the delight formula. It lathers way more than the delight, makes me hair feel dry, and smells absolutely terrible. I will be returning it and ordering the delight version again.
"
"
Love this product.  Still a little suds and cleansy hair.
"
"
After using it my hair was so dry.
"
"
Good but so expensive
"
"
I have used many products for wavy hair. Deva-curl low-poo is mild enough to use. I find this is the best for my hair. Does not dry my hair out nor leave it grasy.
"
"
I didn't believe the hype... I should have.  My hair looks and feels better than it ever has.
"
"
I love Deva Curl!  I wanted to try the Low Poo thinking I would prefer having a little bit of bubbles when I washed my hair but I don't like this as much as the No Poo mostly because the scent is too sweet/fruity for me.  It also feels like there is a little residue with the Low Poo when I rinse and I don't like that feeling.  It just wasn't for me.  It still makes curls more defined and doesn't dry my hair out so I still like it.  I'm sure for those who don't care for the scent/feel/no bubbles of the No Poo might like this one better.  But once I run out of the Low Poo, I'm going back to the No Poo.
"
"
The shampoo is great but the pump came cracked at the top so had to use an old one I had.
"
"
I have been using low- poo for two years. It is great !
"
"
I love the Deva Curl products and I have been using them for years. I use the Low Poo No Fade Shampoo, One Condition No Fade Ultra Creamy Conditioner and Angel Conditioning Gel every day. Here and there I use Mist-er Right Lavender Curl Revitilizer to give my curls a regroup when they are getting too crazy or a pick me up when they are looking flat. I also like to use Set-It Free Moisture lock when they are too wind blown, frizzy or have too many fly-aways. I am a regular person, I do not make any money from Deva Curl and I have no affiliation with them. I am just a customer who loves their products! I'll admit the price is a hard pill to swallow sometimes for me but I've tried LOTS of other products and this is the best hands down. I have natural very curl hair and my hair loves this stuff. I get more compliments when I follow a 100% Deva Curl regimen than when I have tried anything else. Plus, after crunching some numbers, I spend about the same on these products yearly when I buy the big bottles of each product as I do for the cheap / lower cost store brands I've tried. A little bit of this product goes a long way each time, the big bottles last me several months, at least 3 if not 4 or more, and the quality is stellar. It takes double the amount of the cheap products to do a fraction of the job that the Deva Curl products do for my locks.  I always shop for the best deal here on Amazon. The products are literally double or triple the price anywhere else in the town I live (Jacksonville, FL) b/c the only places who sell it are salons. From one curly girl to another this stuff is awesome, I love it, it's worth the price, buy it on Amazon for a better deal and if you know a place with even better deals let me know!
"
"
I really like this stuff. I have fine hair and it really helps to keep it from getting greasy.
"
"
It's good shampoo - that's the most I can say about it. It definitely met my expectations. My hair looks good.
"
"
Didn't know my hair loss was due to shampoo until I used this product.  Now my hair has grown all back. Yeah!
"
"
Since I have started using it. I am facing very very bad hair fall. So I have stopped using it. It turned out to be complete waste of my money
"
"
It helps to maintain the moisture balance in the hair and does not make the scalp too itchy or flaky like some products for frizzy hair do.
"
"
Love this product.  Finally after many years I have found a product that makes me like my hair.  I have a lot of thick curly hair and have always struggled with dry and frizzy hair.  This really helps keep it under control.
"
"
Same salon product at a fraction of the price.  My hair extensions say a great big ""thank you so much!""
"
"
It takes a bit to get used to the minimal suds, that is why I don't use the no poo, but it is great.  There is no residue left on your hair, it helps the curl stay curly and not frizzy. I wash my hair twice a week instead of every other day or daily as prior to use.  The only negative that I have is it leaves a lot of gunk in the tub.  Since I bathe instead of shower, I end up with a ring.  To solve this problem, I wipe down the tub immediately after draining the water.
"
"
leaves my hair feeling/looking less than squeaky clean.  I have curly hair and I like lighter products that encourage curls.
"
"
This is a great shampoo for anyone.  I use it for my hair because it is fine and curly and I try to protect the body.  Expensive but it goes a long way and has a great result.
"
"
I really like this low-lather shampoo. It doesn't dry my hair out, but leaves it clean and soft. Great w/ the other Deva Curl products.I like this better than the No-Poo which left my hair a bit greasy.
"
"
This shampoo  gave me itchy scalp with horrible  dandruff.  Ive never had such a problem before  using this. It doesnt clean the scalp so the oil sits on there and creates dandruff.
"
"
Keeps my curls looking great!
"
"
Made my hair fall out
"
"
The product was discolored. Not the clear consistency that I normally receive when purchasing DevaCurl Low-Poo shampoo.
"
"
Was referred to this product line from my hairdresser - I had to relearn how to care for curly hair.  Now I go 2 years or more between hair cuts - just because I start noticing split ends...2 years?!  I only wash my hair 1-2 times a week and use the conditioner Deva Curl Low-Poo Mild Lather Cleanser and One Condition Ultra Creamy Daily Conditioner Duo 32 Oz.] ]and light defining gel to lock in the moister.  Also, I don't straighten my hair anymore because I love it curly now, never brush or comb when dry, only use a wide toothed comb in the shower while conditioner set to remove tangles, and I only blow dry with a diffuser and clips [[ASIN:B00143WQI6 Diane Double Prong Clips 80 Clips if I need to go somewhere within a couple hours of a shower.  (the clips are used to hold body in the curls during drying)I have to mention the No-Poo Cleanser caused me to get hard itchy bumps along my hairline.  Which I thought was skin cancer, but Doctor said they  were from an allergic reaction.  A year after I had changed to the No-Poo I realized what the change had been that caused the bumps.  My hairdresser confirmed and said that if you experience a reaction to the No-Poo that the Low-Poo is the better option.  So - I switched and sure enough all the bumps and symptoms went away.  That was years ago now and I am still going strong with these products.

I did not purchase my products from Amazon, I purchased from an authorized retailer, but they aren’t posting my review so I am posting here too. DO NOT buy devacurl products! I have lost probably 1/3 at least of my hair from these products, my hair is damaged, it hardly curls anymore, my scalp was itchy/burning and I had a major dandruff problem while using these products. A simple google search will show you the controversy going on currently with devacurl. Don’t waste your money and don’t risk this happening to you! I believe at one time their products were good and that’s why the reviews are mostly good, but something has changed with their products and they aren’t what they used to be. Their reviews should reflect these changes. There is a current class action lawsuit forming against them for the damage they’ve caused to at least tens of thousands of people. Probably more. Don’t risk it happening to you too!

I have NEVER done this, but I've just deleted my 5-star low-poo review and must replace it with this 1-star review. That probably seems terribly dramatic, but whatever Deva has done to the formulation of their low-poo has absolutely RUINED it!!!!!!!  I was using a bottle that was purchased in October (from Ulta) and it was WONDERFUL - left my 3c corkscrews so soft, elastic and bouncy with absolutely no frizz! I just got a new bottle and couldn't believe what came out of the bottle. It looked and smelled the same but it barely lathered (I had to use a lot more) and left my hair hard, dry, knotted and frizzy (after conditioning and styling/drying).  I was so taken aback! I then used the very last dregs I could squeeze out of my old bottle (the following day) and, ta-da! - bouncy, soft, elastic curls, so it wasn't just my imagination!I even RETURNED and exchanged the new bottle thinking maybe I somehow got an adulterated batch, but no luck! My sister even tried a THIRD new bottle and she had the same result as me - hard, knotty, straw-like hair - the complete opposite of our results with previous bottles of low-poo.DEVA - I have no idea WHAT you have done to the low-poo, but you have completely destroyed the best cleansing product my hair had EVER seen! I so wish I had stocked up on big bottles of it this past summer, but of course I couldn't have anticipated this. What a huge disappointment.  I will never buy this again (though, who knows, maybe since Ulta has such a great return/exchange policy, I'll try again sometime down the line out of nostalgia).  This new formulation is HORRIBLE. Absolute junk.  Looks like my search begins again for a 'curly girl' cleanser that will give me good results.  I'm going to try Giovanni 'smooth as silk' shampoo - Giovanni Smooth as Silk Shampoo, Packaging May Vary, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)... here's to hoping!

I went no poo about 6 months ago and really like this cleanser! I have super long thick curls and after using this and deva one conditioner I now don't really need either. My hair is tangle free with no products. I cannot believe it! I use these maybe a few times a month and love them!
"
"
Love it! I have curly hair. I lo poo and then condition but I leave the conditioner in. I just l towel mu hair and off I go.
"
"
Bought for a friend.
"
"
I have been using this product for a month now, and while I really think it does a great job at hydrating, I am concerned about not combing the hair. Gliding fingers through the hair in the shower seems like a bad idea, since I tried it and lost lot of hair. Not sure how others are doing it ? I also only use this once or twice a week, so the whole week hair looks great, but is all tangled up, and when I use the deva products at the end of the week, there is lot of hair loss. If anyone has suggestions, please guide.Thanks!
"
"
The product is excellent, exactly what I ordered.  However, it arrived with the seal broken in a too-small box and some of the product was out in the box.
"
"
I love this shampoo.
"
"
I love DEva Curl products! I will also order this product through this company again. The price is great and the service was extremely quick.
"

Of all the vast number of products I have tried over many years for curly hair, I keep coming back to the Low Poo version of the DevaCurl shampoo. Buying in a huge bottle really saves money and will last you a very long time. They've even improved this version by removing the red dye and it had a built-in pump. The smell is very light citrus and not overwhelming. I have tried the No Poo version and found it left my hair too oily. The Low Poo is just right.The feel of the cleanser is going to be different than regular shampoos you may have tried before. I typically do 3 phases, the top and sides of the scalp, the underneath of the hair, and then part about halfway on the back of my head and gently massage. Then I will gently pull the cleanser through to the ends of my hair and rinse, rinse, rinse. If I've been very active (it's the summer in SE U.S.) I may repeat.I do not follow-up with any other products because my particular hair style doesn't really need it. This cleanser leaves my hair soft and curly with just a nice touch of shine. If it's going to be very humid and I'm worried about things flying around, I do have one of the DevaCurl smoother sprays that I can add to wet hair.
"
"
At the time, I had never bought a DevaCurl product from the store. So when I got this, I wouldn't have known if it was knock off or not. It did smell great, like a salon quality product, and it made my hair feel really good. It didn't make my hair look different though, my curls looked the same. Since then, I have bought this shampoo from a salon and there is a distinctly different smell. The salon poo has more of a lemony scent. This makes me think this product could be a knock off. But, don't care! It smelled better and still made my hair feel cleaner.
"
"
I was looking for a light conditioner without silicones, and I thought this would do the trick, but I missed that it’s got lanolin in it (the same stuff you use for nipple cream when you’re nursing!). It leaves a massive waxy buildup in my hair. I look like a greaseball 8 hours after washing, even if I only use a dime-sized amount on my bra-strap-length hair.Gave it 3 stars because I guess if you have insanely dry, corkscrew-curly hair, it’ll work for that. I dunno. But it’s definitely not a “light” conditioner.
"
"
1st-Product arrived damaged. Cap was completely destroyed. Have to take off the top to squeeze the product out.2nd- Now, the product itself is great thus far. I have low porosity 4 type hair, protein sensitive.Surprisingly, my hair felt pretty moisturized afterwards. Followed up with orginal one conditioner,  b leave in and ultra gel. My hair was very defined, not weighed down, and moisturized after 2 days. I spray set it free spray every other day and steam my hair in the shower. Cuticles are open and product absorbs.*Yes, the Deva gels have protein in it, but they are the smaller (absorbing) and moisturizing proteins that work well with most loo po hair. However, always remember to clarify at least once a month if loo po.
"
"
At first, I loved this as it made my curls look fabulous. However, after time, I noticed my hair never felt clean and my hair fell out at an alarming rate in the shower. My hair was getting thinner too, where you are supposed to use the most shampoo. Two days after stopping using this product line, I noticed I only am loosing a few strands of hair which is normal. Very disappointed in a product that would cause hair loss.  After reading more reviews, I discovered people were also loosing their hair with this product as well.
"
"
If you have curly hair, you really need to give this a chance. I have had curly hair since I was 14 (puberty somehow turned my hair curly from straight), and my curls are 3B with low porosity. I have tried tons of salon hair care products to keep my hair moisturized, and through college, I turned to huge bottles from Big Lots because that's all I could afford. I tried the ""no-shampoo"" method for nearly a year, and when my family found out, they splurged and got me this. Oh how my life has changed. I use this shampoo every other day (no need to use it more often than that), and the 32 oz. bottle has lasted me over a year with 1/3 of the bottle left. It does not lather at all, so don't expect it to. Although others have said to use it liberally, I have never found the need to. A small amount goes a long way if you're willing to distribute it thoroughly. Your hair feels completely clean regardless. It also hydrates your curls so well, a feeling I have never experienced after using harsh shampoos that strip your hair of everything. Follow up using a curl-specific conditioner for perfect hair every time. I use L'oreal sulfate-free products because I'm poor and cheap.
"
"
I really like Deva products however my hair is bleached about halfway down but, I want to grow it out. DevaCurl No-Poo original and DevaCurl conditioner really helped the tangled mess after a shower but even after using a 32 oz. a bottle I wasn't comfortable with the no-poo feel while washing my hair. I guess after 50 years of harsh shampoos it was hard getting used to no suds. I purchased the Low-Poo thinking it would only suds up a little but it did sud up a lot and even after using the conditioner this was the most tangled I've ever had after washing, I had so much breakage! I am definitely going back to the NO-POO asap!
"
"
Do not buy if you're allergic to wheat. It took me forever to realize that wheat protein is in the whole line of Devacurl products. They work really nicely, but at what cost???? lol
"
"
This shampoo is definitely not no-poo gentle, nor is it not 'poo enough to really clean my hair. The consistency is weird...slimy. The feeling I have when I use it is that I have to keep adding more for it to cleanse my hair. If I use just a little bit my hair feels grungy. Something is just not right with this pricey product. The end result is that this shampoo leaves my hair dull and very dried out. The biggest (only?) plus I give this low-poo is that the scent is nice. btw, I have wavy-to-curly thick caucasian hair.
"
"
I have curly hair and I have been using loo poo shampoo for a year. I love it my hair have not look better. They are no freeze dry and out of control. I do not use any chemicals or even hair dryer to dry my hair. It wash with loo poo put a little Devacurl gel and I am on my way. I would recommend this to all with curly hair.
"
"
I don't normally write reviews, but this one is worth it. I have very fine, thin, dry, type 3A/3B curls and the Low-Poo works wonders. I used to shower and wash my hair every day because I run regularly, and using shampoo really just destroyed my hair. Now I've been using the Low-Poo and a regular conditioner and my curls are shiny and healthy (and it's only been a few days!). The product smells pleasant (not fruity or sweet). Would definitely recommend for people with dry hair who have to wash frequently.
"
"
It’s does my hair justice. It’s so hard to go back to regular shampoo after using this one. People tell me all the time that they can smell my hair hours after I bathed. My hair feels and looks clean even days after.
"
"
My curly hair (3a/3b I think?) is fine and gets fairy knots and otherwise tangled very easily.  Too much product can easily weigh it down.  Most shampoos leave it feeling over-dried and frizzy, and a more ""no-poo"" route leaves my roots feeling oily.  Usually I have to rely on conditioner to actually de-tangle my hair, but I was amazed when this shampoo did that before I even attempted conditioner.  I read some people said it smells bad, but I think mine smells like the green apple Jolly Rancher candy.
"
"
I switched from Shea Moisture to DevaCurl and couldn't be more pleased. I get to go longer between washes of my 3a/3b non-porous curly hair and feel like the products last longer, even if the short term price tag is higher. I use this with the weightless waves conditioner and the soft hold gel most often. It has a light botanical smell that disappears quickly.
"
"
I'm still trying to find a shampoo that doesn't leave my hair feeling like straw after. The Low Poo is better than most of the competing brands which can weigh your hair down or even drier. The scent is light and pleasing, but bear in mind if your'e used to shampoos that suds up, the Low Poo requires a bit of water to get sudsing action.
"
"
I love this cleanser.  The fragrance is not overwhelming, and it's very gentle on my hair and scalp.  I was able to reduce the frequency with which I was my hair through using this shampoo.  I can get away with two, sometimes three days, whereas with conventional shampoos, I would be greasy by the end of the day.I'm a curly, but I still blow dry my hair pretty regularly (gasp).  I feel like this cleanser is good for either purpose.EDIT: I no longer love this one. I found after only a few weeks of use, I started getting a lot of white, greasy buildup in my hair. I was using only curly girl products, and as directed. I don't really use the shampoo anymore, but the gel is still my go-to
"
"
Recived it came opened and was spilled all over the bag
"
"
I finally have come to know that it's this shampoo that makes my hair smell dirty, after some experimenting. OK, I do have thicker hair and didn't know that this was for fine hair, but whenever I use it, if I go a day without washing my hair - it will smell grosser than it ever has in my life. I love all my other Deva Curl products. Hate this shampoo!
"
"
Saved my dry, damaged coarse curly hair. I have this obsession where I HAVE to wash my hair every day even though I know it's terrible for me. This did just the trick, I get the clean feeling and refreshed hair-do while also retaining the moisture my hair so needs. Love devacurl. Devacurl or die.
"
"
I'm so glad I realized there was a difference between the 'Original' formula and the 'Delight' formula which I had originally tried. This original formula has a MUCH nicer scent. I was ready to switch brands because of the obnoxious smell of the Delight, but now I'm re-sold on this shampoo.
"
"
Used once or twice a week, this keeps my hair soft and locks in more moisture than regular shampoo, super important in this low-humidity atmosphere. I still need to use regular shampoo at least once a month to deep-clean though; using more of this product just doesn't cut it and my hair starts getting flat if I wait too long. Considering it takes a month to get there though, I am quite satisfied with this shampoo!
"
"
I am very happy with my product, the only problem is that it arrived with the bottle cap broken and the shampoo spilled out into the box.  The vendor replaced it and the second bottle was ok I live this shampoo because it defines my curls so nice I dont need mousse.  I'm very happy with it.
"
"
Deva products are overpriced, but this shampoo is excellent.  Lathers but not too much, smells fresh, and doesn't weigh down fine hair.
"
"
Great smelling, no additives, have been using this for years. I am never afraid of putting the Deva products on my hair and scalp and having my skin absorb bad chemicals; Deva is natural and best for curly girl hair! The Low-Poo version (as opposed to the No-Poo) gives you the lather you might desire, although I do switch between the two. There is no buildup in my hair and it works best for my curls. My hair is never dry feeling after using DevaCurl. I have medium curly hair.
"
"
Great product and failure of shipping. Lost a couple of ounces. If manufacturer would lock the lid, it would keep it from untwisting during shipping. I count myself lucky, b/c others lost more product than myself.
"
"
Love this shampoo! I have white girl curly thick hair and this shampoo is great. Ir doesn't make my hair greasy and works perfectly with my other Deva Curl products
"
"
This review is for the product not the seller. The product came on time and decently packaged.I have the No Poo Cleanser and love it. This Low-Poo cleanser smells insanely like chemicals. Made my scalp dry, itchy. My curly hair is lank and dead and I am so surprised. I bought this huge bottle and can not use it now. I will have to stick to the No Poo cleanser which is much creamier and doesnt smell like death.
"
"
I have the No-Poo also, which I use 75% of the time. But sometimes I just want a deeper clean faster, and this does a great job without drying my hair. Been using six months now and my curly hair is looking healthier all the time!
"
"
Scent was not as nice as the regular version of this. Also it lathered too much compared to their other product. Also it didn't bring out curls as well.
"
"
This shampoo/ lo-poo smells so good! If you are have a curly hair it will save your curl ( no frizz or dry hair)just make sure you only use water based hair products as this shampoo doesn't clears oily products very well..
"
"
This shampoo truly brings out the natural curl in my hair! Great product!
"
"
I prefer the no-poo (I ordered this by mistake) but this is also very good.
"
"
I've used this product for over a year now and wouldn't use anything else!  I tried the No-Poo, but it just took too long to work though my hair and finally feel like it was clean.  The Low-Poo gives just enough lather.
"
"
Switched from No-Poo to Low Poo to see if my hair would tolerate it a bit better. The Low Poo is quite a bit easier to apply and rinse out of my long, thick, curly hair. It does have a chemical smell when applying, which is the reason for 4 stars. I don't seem to notice it after my shower.
"
"
Perfect. The same one I normally buy at the salon. However this one is a bit cheaper and gets ships to my house. Win, win.
"
"
I am a huge fan of Deva products and love that they come in such large sizes. I have fine hair and have found the low-poo works better for me than the no-poo. The no-poo left my hair a bit lank, but with the low-poo it is full of volume. If you are on the fence, buy a smaller size of each to compare before committing to the larger size. I have chin-length s' wavy hair, and the large bottle lasts me about six months.
"
"
Nothing wrong with the product but No Poo works better for my hair which is wavy not terribly curly.  I tried this because my stylist said it would make my hair look fuller.  It did but No Poo gives me more curl.
"
"
It's low-lather.  That's one of its selling points, but I have very thick hair and I had to use a LOT of shampoo to get it to travel through my hair and get my scalp clean.  If your hair is dry or thin or delicate this might be right for you.  I wasn't in love.  I love the Deva Curl gel though!
"
"
My stylist recommended Devacurl for my fine 3b frizz prone hair and I've been using it for a month. I love it. I now get compliments on my hair and people asking what I use. I'm falling in love with my curls.
"
"
Not same as purchased at Harmons . Much cheap with coupons
"
"
I love that this cleanser is super mild with no sulfates. It is gentle on my curls and doesn't strip my hair of essential oils. The Deva Curl line has never let me down, but unfortunately I seem to be allergic to this. Every time I've used it, my head becomes extremely itchy. I hope no one else has this reaction to it, but I thought I'd share my experience. I will stick with the NoPoo from now on.
"
"
I tried some my friend bought from a salon before buying this. It works just as well as what she purchased for a lot less. My hair is so much curlier, softer, and less frizzy. I don't use any other product (not even conditioner) on my hair since switching to this low-poo.
"
"
Great for daughters naturally curly hair.  She has THICK, LONG curly hair and this helps keeps it from drying, breaking and frizzing.  There's plenty more to her hair routine--this is just part, but it does seem to help.  Does not lather so it takes getting used to.  Light fragrance that doesn't stay so it doesn't interfere with other product scents.
"
"
I got this shampoo because of all the good reviews and the results other people showed. I used until I got a really bad dandruff. Two stars because made my hair curly as I want.
"
"
I have to use a lot every time I wash my hair
"
"
I buy the big ones and they last forever. This company got it here fast. Thank you!
"
"
Love, love, love.  This is an excellent product for people with wavy hair.  It really keeps my hair smooth, even in high humidity.
"
"
Good product for baby fine hair.  It's had for me to find hair products that don't weigh down baby fine hair.  This works pretty good when you alternate the days you use it or it starts to build up like most products.  Baby fine hair is tricky to keep it looking moisturized with out looking greasy or weighed down.
"
"
I purchased the larger bottle of this, and it's lasting longer than I expected...good thing since it is a little bit of an investment on haircare products.  The one thing I love is that I no longer have an itchy scalp throughout the day after washing my hair.  With dry, curly, semi-coarse hair, this can be a problem.  But the itchiness is no more!  I have long hair, not as thick as it used to be due to excessive shedding and thinning over the past three years, and I'm getting away with about 4 pumps of shampoo, sometimes 5.  So this is good, I expect the bottle will last a while for me.  I love that the scent is mild, and my hair does not feel weighed down or heavy.  I tried doing the conditioner-only wash over a year ago, and this did not do anything good for my hair.  It became very tangle-y and matted and eventually accumulated build-up at the roots, even though I was using all products with no 'cones.  I like actually being able to wash my hair and know that I'm not stripping it completely and at the same time actually getting it clean.  I will eventually try out the Deva conditioners and see how they work for me as well.  I can't say that the texture of my hair has improved any at this point, but it's definitely clean and scalp isn't itchy, so that's good enough for me!
"
"
I love this product. Most shampoos leave my hair feeling dry, needing conditioner. This left my hair feeling moisturized and healthy. I see a very clear difference in my hair after switching. I will never use “regular” shampoo again.
"
"
Package was leaking and several ounces were missing upon arrival
"
"
Absolutely love love these products they are simply wonderful. They work just as stated. Try you will not regret
"
"
My favorite
"
"
The shampoo works well, just gotta get past the odor. The no-poo smells lovely, this smells like super glue.
"
"
This product was an unusual dark yellow and smelled bad. Washed OK, though. Maybe it was on the shelf too long?
"
"
I started with the no poo, but the combination of the no poo and the one condition was a little no conditioning for me. Since I switched to the low poo my curls have been happier and not weighed down.
"
"
It makes my hair feel soft and clean. I alternate it with Soma clarifying shampoo. That routine has helped add more shine to my hair.
"
"
I love this shampoo.  You only use a small amount, and it lasts forever.  Leaves my hair silky smooth, no conditioner needed.  Highly recommend for permed hair.
"
"
Been using DevaCurl products for several years and continue to be very happy.
"
"
This, and it's friend 'No-Poo', (and I don't care what anybody thinks of the names - they work for me) are THE best shampoos on the market for fragile hair. My hair isn't curly at all. It's SUPER fine, British, wispy, greasy overnight and lightened too, just to make the breakage issue even worse. These cleanse perfectly without constantly eating away at that poor little wispy cuticle. I'm sure they do a little bit, but my breakage is WAY lower when I stick to these with super strong thick conditioners afterwards and a little bit of keratin or silk protein from time to time. Oh, and a Hercules Sagemann comb. (Google this  - it's about 12 bucks and it glides through tangled hair without even one of those 'popping sounds which you know signals a hair breaking off half way down it's shaft.) But the shampoos - amazing.
"
"
Boxed incorrectly and the item was leaking
"
"
Good value and cleans hair well
"
"
Not sure about this shampoo. Smells funky and dries my hair out. Almost seems like it's like castile soap. I have used the Devacurl No Poo and had better results.
"
"
DevaCurl has changed my relationship with my hair!  I have finer hair and this makes it difficult to use No-Poo very frequently.  No-Poo is a little too heavy for my hair texture.  Lo-Poo is perfect!
"
"
I love this shampoo.  It's a little new not to have lather but it made an immediate diference in my curls.  The fragrance is very light and clean.  I chose the ""Low-Poo"" because I do Bikam's Yoga but I think I'll try the ""no-poo,"" as well.  Actually, I think I'll try several of the DevaCurl products.  I just couldn't be happier with this product.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
I have wavy to straight hair and it loves this shampoo. More elasticity and shine than it has on shampoos with sulfates. Also, I am allergic to most fragrances (skin rashes) and have no problem with the wonderful essential oils Deva puts in the Low Poo. Highly recommend.
"
"
Love this stuff. Gets my curly hair clean without stripping it of oils. Took a week or two for my hair/scalp to adjust.
"
"
I have really curly hair, I've tried all shampoos and up until now I have never really loved any of them. Not until deva curl. It is amazing stuff. Very rich controls frizz, defines curls. Very affordable, smells great. They have lots of accessories but he shampoo and one condition conditioner is all I need to have AMAZING curls. Look up one of the Deva curl hair dressers for an amazing curly girl hair cut too!
"
"
Has completely saved my hair!
"
"
I feel like this is conditioner, I love it. I am about to order my second bottle of low poo. My hair has never been better. I rarely have to use product to help with the frizz anymore. If I do I use moroccan oil on the ends. I often feel like I don't even need to use the conditioner after I use the Low Poo, it is that awesome. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a more gentle shampoo and has curly hair.
"
"
Been using low poo for years now.  I have 3B curls.  It smells great, doesn't dry out my curls, and does not leave icky residue.  It works well with One Condition.
"
"
Do not like these products and now past return date.....does not do well for curls
"
"
Love the low-poo cleanser and especially in the 32 ounce pump. I use the Deva Curl/deva girl method and the low poo cleanser is better for my hair than the no-poo. Definitely ordering from here again.
"
"
I love DevaCurl conditioner but am not crazy about the shampoo. It feels gooey, almost like it is leaving a film behind. For daily use, I prefer Wen. However, I give the DevaCurl conditioner 5 stars!!
"
"
I'm learning to use this correctly.  After years of using regular shampoo, this does not lather as I was used to and still cleans my hair. For the money I got a large supply.
"
"
This entire product line is gentle and good for all hair types.  My daughter, son and I are completely happy with this product.  There is also a ""no-poo"" version... but his has absolutely NO suds and many folks like to feel the foamy action in the shower... but hair has never been healthier.
"
"
Great shampoo without all the added sulphates.
"
"
I have extremely long curly hair that is a little bit of a challenge to care for.  This product has enhanced my curls and made my hair healthier, overall.  It's not easy to find a really good product for curls.  I'm sticking with this one.
"
"
This shampoo gives a rich conditioning feel without lather.  I love it.  It helps keep my thick curls from tangling so much.
"
"
I'm a fan of Deva but the shampoos I can't do.  I used this for quite some time and my scalp started to itch quite a bit.  I finally stopped using it and my head felt so much better.  I still use all the other products I just use a different shampoo.
"
"
My hair doesn't feel weighed down and I feel like this helped clarify all the build-up in it. Even helped with my dry scalp. Definitely need to use with a good conditioner. Would recommend.
"
"
This is a great shampoo.  My hairs tend to be dry and frizzy.  This product seems more gentle on my hairs.  I have purchased it more then once.
"
"
I was so thrilled to be able to find Deva Curl Low Poo in such a large size at such a reasonable price. Thank you so much for the value and thank you for shipping it immediately. I will shopw with you again, always!Sincerely,Northwest Girl
"
"
Great buy!
"
"
I love this low poo, it's one I use regularly and can't seem to part with!
"
"
I use this every other time I wash my hair. I switch between this and Deva Curl No Poo. I than use Deva Curl Light Defining Gel. Deva Curl has great products for us Curly Girls.
"
"
I absolutely love this shampoo!  I have 2b hair that needs extra moisture and this shampoo really works great for me.  It makes my hair feel clean but moisturized at the same time.
"
"
It's my favorite shampoo I love it!!!
"
"
But it's too moisturizing for my oily hair. I use a stronger shampoo for my first wash and follow with this. If you live somewhere drier or have dry hair I bet this is awesome!
"
"
Not authentic Deva curl product, dried my hair out horribly and made my scalp itch horribly!!! Waste of money
"
"
Don't know why the word leather is put in description. This is shampoo. Very happy with all products in deva curl  line. But pricey.
"
"
Best shampoo for curly headed women. You have to get used to it. But once you do, you'll never use anything else again.

Worked well on permed hair as well
"
"
They have really watered this down.
"
"
I have thin, curly hair that often gets oily throughout the day. Although the DevaCurl styling products aren't for me, I LOVE the Low-Poo and No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner. After using it for a week, my curls have less frizz and more bounce and shine.
"
"
Best price for those products!!!Love them, love the price!!
"
"
Not only was the pump rusted and spewing gross red particles into the shampoo, the shampoo smelled like straight up chemicals. This is a fake product!
"
"
Always love Deva.
"
"
Good price for a giant bottle of shampoo!
"
"
was not happy with it
"
"
I loved it! Makes my hair feel wonderful! Saves me loads of time. Looks great and makes me feels wonderful!
"
"
Did not work for me. Made my hair feel greasy? I think this might be really good for a thick/coarse curl.
"
"
Excellent product.
"
"
I Love this shampoo.  It cleans mine and my grandkids hair very nicely and is Eco friendly.  It smells good too.
"
"
I've used this item before, very good cleanser & like it sais low poo
"
"
Makes my hair look and feel too oily.
"
"
I have curly hair, and this product ensures that I'm frizz free.  Love it !!!!
"
"
The real deal at a great price!
"
"
A nice, mild shampoo for curly and/or dry hair. But the scant. Ugh. Like plastic and citrus.
"
"
Love this shampoo for curly hair. Doesn't leave residue and keeps my hair soft. It's a great product and now a great price.
"
"
The Low Poo and No Poo have a completely different effect on my curls. I plan to go back to No Poo.
"
"
I love this shampoo. A little bit of suds which I like. No poo works well but I use it less.
"
"
Great for kids with Curly hair!
"
"
Not near as good or conditioning as the no-poo
"
"
perfect for my mixed hair.
"
"
Been using this shampoo for a few years.  Love it what more can I say?  I have fine curly hair and this product helps keep it healthy.
"
"
pump nozel is extremely difficult to open.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
THANK YOU

"
THANK YOU

Great for you hair.

Love this shampoo!!  I have curly, coloured hair and this cleanser is easy on my colour and cleanses my curls without drying them out. Very satisfied with this entire product line.
"
"
OK quality but very expensive.
"
"
Excellent product.  Good value.
"
"
As a curly hair girl I love this product
"
"
Love how it smells and the way it cleans my locks!  I'm hooked
"
"
Love it

Best shampoo for curly hair!

I live in a humid Florida environment, taming my curly hair has been a battle for most of my life (even in dry environments) until I discovered this product.  Thank you thank you thank you.I have thin curly hair (spirals), that seems to absorb up all the moisture I throw at it, and still manage to get frizzy, dry and unmanageable.  I've been researching products for the various hair types, specifically curly hair types and this product was amongst the recommendations.  I tried it, and have not gone back! Some of the reviews are correct, if you use too much of this product, or too often, you hair will have a greasy feel.  But what I've discovered, that since may hair absorbs so much moisture, this ""greasy feeling"" does not last long.  I must admit, it took me a while to get used to the ""no suds"" feeling of the shampoo, the thought that if there is `no suds' the hair must not be clean .  But my hair is shiny, soft and curly...beautiful from day 1 to the next.I have completely switched to the Deva Curl product line and am very satisfied with the outcome.
"
"
No more, no less. It lathers up a bit as opposed to the No-Poo variety, but other than that, there's nothing notable about it. The scent is chemically, even though it does not contain the usual artificial chemicals most shampoos do, like sulfates and it gets your hair clean, no better or worse than any drugstore shampoo.If you want a more natural, sulfate-free shampoo, save the high price of this and go to a drugstore and read labels. There are a billion and one sulfate-free, chemical-free, moisturizing/smoothing shampoos out there for much, much less money that smell wonderful and do a great job. Burt's Bees and the Say Yes To...line of products are two examples.
"
"
Love this product. I have curly hair and most shampoos leave hair too dry.  This cleanses your hair without a lot of lather. Curly hair is dryer than straight hair, so us '"" curlys"" must always have alot of moisture in our hair so that our curls are defined and not frizzy.  This shampoo helps obtain the ritual that we follow.
"
"
This was upposed to be a new item but had clearly been used. This showed up with dried, brown gel coming out of the pump.  When I opened the bottle I found the same brown gel inside the tube. (See photo). Now I have to pay for a lable (no printer) and go to the UPS store which is owned by a jerk.  I went from super happy that this showed up so soon to disgusted and annoyed.  What a waste of time.
"
"
I can't get over how grateful I am to the hairstylist who recommended that I use a sulfate-free shampoo, particularly DevaCurl products, for my naturally curly, long hair (curl type 3b for those of you who know what that means).  Getting rid of sulfate-containing products has totally changed my hair and curls for the better - my hair is glossy, not as dry, not as frizzy, etc., etc... I can't recommend this product enough, honestly.  I use every other day with DevaCurl Mister Right in between washes to re-shape my curls.  This shampoo does a great job of cleaning my hair well without stripping it.  Bravo DevaCurl!
"
"
I love this shampoo; my hair is naturally loosely curled.  I use about (the equivalent of) two teaspoons each time I wash my hair.  Even though it does not produce a ton of lather, it does clean well.  When done shampooing, my hair feels a bit ""slick"", not greasy, but like it has moisturizer on it.  For this reason I don't use a conditioner in the shower - I just make sure the shampoo is rinsed out well.  After I shampoo, I don't wrap my hair in a towel, I just blot it dry by scrunching the towel up towards my scalp.  I then use about a dime size portion of the Deva Curl B'Leave-In leave in conditioner, applying it while scrunching my hair.  This shampoo has a pleasant smell.
"
"
I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. I have to use this product because it is sulfa free and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product keeps my hair feeling clean all day.
"
"
Whether you are Male or Female, if you have Curly or Wavy hair you need to try this product.  I always had to use so much product to keep the frizz down with my curls.. then the product would weigh my hair down, making my curls look drab.  I started using Low Poo and One condition 2 years ago.  Now I only use scrunching foam when I want my curls to look fantastic..My husband starting using this product, after I read that Head and Shoulders causes receding hairline in Men.  Head and Shoulders made his hair so greasy his pillow case was always nasty.  Now he can go 2 days without shampooing and his hair looks great.Give it a try.
"
"
I couldn't deal with the No Poo version.  I crave suds and I found the No Poo to difficult to distribute through my long hair.  This Low Poo is the perfect alternative to regular shampoos which have high phosphate levels which dry out my curls.
"
"
Like this more than the no-poo - I need lather.  This has worked well for us and we like the smell.  Some people mentioned the feeling that you can't rinse it out, but this hasn't been a problem and to some extent it feels like it's protecting the delicate curly hair.  The combination of the low-poo and the one condition has been excellent.
"
"
I love this shampoo for my s'wavy hair but the package I received was leaking so when I opened it there was wasted shampoo everywhere... A bit frustrating for as much as you pay.
"
"
It left my hair feeling greasy and oily all the time. My hair literally never felt clean, even after I washed it multiple times in the shower. I think my curls looked better, but it wasn't worth my hair feeling that greasy.
"
"
I really like that it lathers.  I feel like I'm using quality shampoo that deeply cleans.  I wish the scent was nicer.  Otherwise, it's perfect for my curly hair.
"
"
Deva Curl product was doctor recommended. I have been using this for years and I love how well it works with my curly hair it makes it feel smooth and oh so soft. It’s a bit expensive but worth it. I am allergic to sulfa and Deva products are sulfa free. Deva works great for me!!!
"
"
This product leaves your hair feeling silky and smelling great. It is rather pricey, but the bottle seems to last a long time. I would recommend this product to others.
"
"
I like the product but at least a half cup of the shampoo leaked out in shipment.  Also the plunger did not open and thus went in the trash.  Yuck!!!!
"
"
My hair is thin and dried out and fragile and for years I've been damaging it with commercial shampoos. Then I found this shampoo at a local beauty products store, and after a week, my hair was glistening with moisture, it had darkened to its natural color, and it curled great. The only problem was that it was expensive. So I went to Amazon and found a large size at a much better cost. Yay
"
"
I had been using no poo and ordered this by mistake, It is definitely not for my hair type but it came quickly and i was satified with the distributor
"
"

"
"
The shampoo was packaged without the top being completely screwed on so I lost some product. However, it did not seem like enough to do an exchange.
"
"
Love it.  Use it every day.  Gives my curly hair some defined curl, instead of frizz.  Great price on Amazon.
"
"
Over the last decade I've used a lot of different mom paraban/sulfate type of shampoos.  Some were amazing but discontinued. Some just didn't wash my hair or give my waves what they needed.  I finally decided to try the low poo out.  It was pretty great for about a week, I wash every other day.  By the end of the bottle my hair was both greasy after one day and dry on the ends.  I was thinking it was my conditioner since I use 2 repairing types at once and sometimes a hair oil on the ends. After just using one conditioner and no oil with the shampoo my hair was still feeling simultaneously greasy and dry.  I switched shampoos and my hair is back to clean, fluffy, and soft.  Not sure what happened to dry out my ends and not wash my scalp but this was not for me at all. And didn't do that much for my waves.
"
"
I love the product. But when I received the shampoo it was wrapped in a plastic. It had leaked & approximately 1/3 of the bottle had leaked out. After removing the plastic I figured out the lid was cracked & you can’t use it to pump the shampoo out. Very disappointed. These products are not cheap.
"
"
First day after using this product and a DevaCurl Conditioner my hair turned extremely dry - by the end of the week, when I washed my hair - WAY too many strands came out. It was a little disconcerting to lose so much hair when I never had before, so I went back to my old shampoo and conditioner and sure enough - almost no hair loss during the wash and condition process. My hair hates something in this product.
"
"
Reading up on the product and the reviews I though this shampoo and the One Conditioner would work well for my hair. Unfortunately, it does not. I have been using it for 3 weeks and my hair has never felt greasier. It feels like the product is not rinsing out or like I haven't washed my hair in three weeks. It does enhance my curls but my hair feels disgusting. I'm bummed.
"
"
I expected a lot more from this. 9 did like the conditioner though
"
"
I have permed hair and used the No-Poo for my first go-round but it never really worked well with my extremely hard water.  This version, along with the conditioner, definitely makes my curls softer and less frizzy; and isn't that what all curly girls want?
"
"
I had to say I bought this product because of the great reviews here. I have fine,curly hair that is like of a 'cherub' or wavy curly depending on the day of the week.Anyway, I expected this product to remove more ""dirt"" or whatever (excess conditioner, hair gel, etc.) from my hair. It really felt great in the shower, like it wasn't stripping my hair of moisture, etc. and felt clean. I air-dried my hair and scrunched and tossled it to define curls and give it volume.Low Poo is really great for volume. I had loads of it after use. The draw back was that the ends of my hair were rough, dry and frizzy, wire-y. I really felt that either a) the product did not adequately wash out the gel in my hair from the previous day or b) there is actually hair gel in the shampoo to give the hair definition. Probably great for someone with thicker hair.I will keep experimenting but in the meantime (and could be user error) I will keep using my clarifying shampoo to wash out the excess conditioner and hair gel. Having fine curly hair is a constant battle against limp lifeless hair and dry frizz, and my curls do not look near as shiny and healthy after a good clarifying shampoo every other day. The drawback of that is that I notice more hair in the drain and would like to stop damaging my hair. The No-poo is great but this also builds up over time.
"
"
I washed my hair for YEARS with regular shampoo - and fought the frizz that resulted from the drying effects of sulfates.  No-Poo is different!  It cleans just the right amount and leaves hair feeling silky (rather than straw-like) when it is rinsed.  I will never use anything else on my hair.  Just say no to lather!
"
"
Love this stuff. Pricey but great!
"
"
love this product
"
"
Even if you have coarse curly hair, this product, when used correctly and when accompanied by other suggested Deva products, your curls will be soft and shiny.  I am a believer!
"
"
Let me start out by saying I LOVE the no poo shampoo, but this stuff doesn't clean at all.Well it did wash out the the angel gel that was in my hair but the next day my hair smelled like sheep or cheese .. what ever your hair smells like when its dirty it will smell like that the next day. with the no poo shampoo I can last up to 3 days with out having to wash my hair again. With this stuff i can't last more than 8 hrs and that's in 65 degree weather.
"
"
Was able to get the small amounts of poo out of my hair.
"
"
98% of my hair regimen is DevaCurl products, so I was excited to try this out. I have no issue with their price point because I'm a firm believer in getting what you pay for. That's my problem with this leave in, it's pricey but does not perform. It's not bad by any stretch, but it's just ok. I'll finish the bottle but can't see buying again
"
"
This made my hair very sticky then eventually frizzy. I’ve used Deva products for over a decade, and this absolutely fell short for me. I know how and when to use them and even while applying with saturated wet hair in the shower, I could feel my hair turning to straw with it on. Used it twice. Can’t risk it again. Keep your money and use One Condition decadence as your leave in.
"

Recently starting my curly girl method journey, i began purchasing DevCurl products. I ordered shampoo, conditioner and styling cream from Amazon and i loved them all. i could tell instantly that they were gentle and nourishing and of high quality. Unfortunately when i purchased this product it was absolutely awful - as soon as the product touched my hair in the shower, my hair went ridiculously dry and brittle. i couldn't run my fingers through it AT ALL, bearing in mind i was using this product after i had used a conditioner, so my hair was lovely and soft and then all of a sudden when using this product, it became as dry as wood.now i still haven't had a chance to purchase this item legitimately from the devacurl website, but it's obvious from experience with their other amazing products, that this is not the original. i really believe that this is fake. i gave it a try for a few weeks but it only got worse and i actually ended up selling the remainder for £1 at a carboot sale!I would really encourage everyone to not risk buying this product from Amazon.
"
"
I LOVE this leave in conditioner! My hair is Extremely thick so it is very important that I have a really hydrated leave-in to put into my hair before anything else. This does the trick! I use it after the No Poo Decadence Cleanser and No Poo Decadence Conditioner. Honestly I have tried so many different leave in products over the years but now that I have the decadence DecaCurl line I will jever use any thing else on my hair! The smell is amazing also!!
"
"
I’m a devacurl addict and I really think this product is my favorite.  I really wanted them to make a leave in conditioner, and it has thus far performed well for me.  It leaves my curls soft and moisturized and limits the common, ominous frizzing.  I apply it to wet hair and work it through then let it sit in my hair in a microfiber towel, then air dry.
"
"
I'm still not totally sure I will buy this again. This is not as moisturizing as the Coconut Supercream, but good enough to leave hair looking nice. I am still trying it out, and not sure if I prefer this over the Coconut Supercream.
"
"
Oh gosh! I was so scared to try this because I’ve had zero luck with leave in conditioners. Plus some of the reviews were saying it was too heavy for them; I have a LOT of hair but the strands are fine and wavy. This is PERFECT! The shea moisture one I ordered made my hair feel straw like and frizzy. This one makes my hair feel so soft!!! And I use it in combo with wave maker and the delight gel. Looooove. Thank you DevaCurl 😭🙏🏼🙌🏼
"
"
Makes my hair super soft I love it
"
"
I have type 2b/2c curls and I use this in conjunction with other Deva Curl products.  It’s not enough moisture most of the time so I use a squirt or two of One Condition along with it.  I’m only six weeks into using the curly girl method, so I’m thinking that down the road, when I don’t need as much moisture, this will be enough.  However, I think “Leave-In” conditioners are just a marketing ploy and regular conditioners can be used for the same purpose.  I do like the texture and slip of this stuff, though, so I’ll probably keep it around.  (I’m quite contradictory, aren’t I?  Sorry!).  Please check the seller reviews before you buy because I know there are a lot of counterfeit products out there.
"
"
I received a sample from my hair salon and fell in love with this leave in. My salon was out of the product last time I went so I decided to just buy on amazon. I believe this product I received was an imposter, or was cut down with something else. It didn’t smell nearly the same as my sample, and it was almost watery. I will be returning it for sure

I love DevaCurl products, I am woman of color with natural hair (No chemicals added) and it works wonders for my curls. But, I've seen it work wonders on all curls. If your curly, please give DevaCurl products a try. It leaves my hair soft and when wet adds definition to my curls so they turn into a big Afro.
"
"
The leave in conditioner is the only one I have used that doesn’t strip my color out. It is awesome and I use it almost everyday!
"
"
This product doesn’t do a good job of moisturizing hair for any length of time.  After 1 use my hair is dry as a bone the next morning. I wouldn’t  purchase this product again.
"
"
I have 3C long curly hair and this product did nothing for it. Super disappointed because I use a lot of other Deva products and love them. Definitely would not recommend.
"
"
Hair doesn’t feel soft
"
"
I have pretty extreme natural curls. DevaCurl products are hands down the best products I gave used in over 40 years! This moisturizer leaves a nice scent and a fair amount of added moisture to my curls. I’m still deciphering just how much to use, but so far it’s another item on the DevaCurl list that did not disappoint!
"
"
Does the job in moisturizing the curls but too small of quantity and expensive so had to try another brand for better price unfortunately.
"
"
Pretty much the same price point everywhere you find this product. But the best part is it keeps your hair soft all day long.
"
"
Great leave in conditioner!! Pricey!! 8oz bottle isn't much conditioner!! Wish they sold a bigger bottle. Curls look great!!
"
"
It’s a good leave-in conditioner, but it’s hard to get out and leaves my hair feeling a little heavy and stiff.
"
"
Love Deva Curl leave in conditioner. Even mt Frenchie loves it as well on her coat.
"
"
For any curly hair type. This is hands down worth using !!! Great product!
"
"
I live in a very dry place so my hair normally keeps its curl very well set, but this product did not do its job. I guess my hair is too thick and a lot for this product.
"
"
As with all Deva products, if you have curly here - this is for you!
"
"
I have very thick 3b hair. This was nothing thick enough.
"
"
Very happy.  It’s not heavy.  It’s definitely not sticky like others have posted. I like it.
"
"
Wow I just love this conditioner on my hair. Leaves it so soft. Plus the delicate scent is intoxicating.
"
"
Love the feel and smell.  For a leave in its acceptable.  It arrived professionally packaged, no leakage.
"
"
Great for my sons hair
"
"
I did not like this product at all and do not recommend it.  I use DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner and this product does not live up to the high expectations I have from DevaCurl. It did not provide any real moisture and left my hair very dry and frizzy.  Very disappointed and a total waste of money.
"
"
Light weight. Gets job done
"
"
Love this stuff - save a lot by buying on amazon over the salon.
"
"
My hair doesn’t like protein and it has protein
"
"
holds a curl without being too heavy
"
"
I like this product, it softens my hair and stillallows it to curl. Doesn’t feel heavy!
"
"
My kid has super curly hair but never lets me brush it, thus leading to dreadlocks. I've found if, every other day, I can wash her hair with cleansing conditioner followed by a couple of pumps of this, it doesn't actually need brushing.
"
"
Does not work well for my hair
"
"
Very nice moisturizer for my hair
"
"
I live the moisture that it give and the way it makes the hair look.
"
"
I love that this leave in product did not make my hair sticky feeling.  It defrizzes my naturally curly hair.  I use with aqua phage gel.
"
"
Love this product! Great waves and wonderful aroma
"
"
Its nice and adds moisture to the hair but it didn’t work in refreshing my hair
"
"
Product did not work well for my coils/curly hair. Did not find that it was very moisturizing and needed to add a lot more product than normal.
"
"
Though the product is really good I find it a little too expensive. But it’s great for my daughter’s curls. Make it defined and soft.
"
"
love
"
"
Recommend skipping this product
"
"
Awesome product
"
"
Good product
"
"
felt like did nothing for my hair felt no moisture and was expensive
"
"
I was disappointed with product performance as far as a moisturizer.  I put ample amounts on my hair after washing and conditioning and found it not as good a product as my others.
"
"
The cream seems great so far. But the push top dispenser is dysfunctional. I can’t figure out how to get another one sent to me. Amazon only allows you to return or write a review! Help!
"
"
DevaCurl products have gone down the drain!
"
"
i love this Leave-in conditioner. It makes a huge difference in my curls!
"
"
Its good but i like more the morrocan cream
"
"
This is working great in my hair!
"
"
So disappointing.
"
"
I had a great expectations about this product, but really don't work on my hair leaved a dryness sensation and I needed use so much product.This time isn't a great devacurl product
"
"
It was great
"
"
My hair needs moisturizing leave in product, so this one works well
"
"
Love this product. Makes my super curly hair manageable.
"
"
Love this brand only thing I'll use on my hair shipped fast
"
"
Dried out my hair ! No moisture at all. And I bought so many different products with DevaCurl. I’m unhappy with them all!
"
"
Great product love the smell and how amazing it make my hair look.
"
"
Have tried numerous curly hair products, nothing, nothing beats Deva Curl.
"
"
IT DID EVERYTHING I WANTED IT TO DO
"
"

"
"
Great product!!
"
"
For a devacurl conditioner I though it would be better, but still pretty nice and smells amazing.
"
"
Love the smell, great product.
"
"
Makes my hair look beautiful!
"
"
Pricey but does it work! Also smells amazing.
"
"
Estoy un poco decepcionada no recibí el acondicionador recibí dos champú y el leave in conditioner.

Very moisturizing for my hair. Love the thick consistency. Do not need a lot for hair
"
"
Great product for kinky, frizzy kid hair!
"

I have had natural curls (3b) for a few years and never have had issues with the many products I’ve tried. I don’t know if this product is fake or if it’s true that devacurl changed owners and is adding different ingredients. I’ve heard a lot of horror balding stories lately about the brand but decided to try it out. This product caused a lot of irritation and the back of my neck is red and peeling. I’m not allergic to anything so whatever is in this product must be strong. It caused a lot of itching which has never been a problem for me before. I’ve stopped using it and it’s gotten better. This is a picture of what’s left. Definitely wouldn’t recommend.

I received a large sample of this in my Sephora Play box and immediately fell in love with it. I have thick wavy, shoulder-length hair and like to wear it straight with a blow-out or curly with a blow-crunch. One day while feeling lazy, I just put it on my hair and let it air dry. The result was beautiful ringlet curls that had absolutely no frizz (better than if I had spent 40 minutes crunching it). The product smells so good and feels very light-weight. I just ordered a regular bottle. Only wish it fell under Amazon Prime's 2-day delivery. It's going to take more than a week to come.
"
"
I was hoping this would be a great leave in conditioner but it's just not for my hair type. It doesn't feel soft or hydrated at all after using it. I like the One Condition  Decadence but it's not a leave in.
"
"
So disappointed. I’m a big fan of the decadence line. This product does not live up to the standards of the others. I used almost half the bottle and it does come up to the little bit of conditioner that I’ve been using as a leave in.
"
"
Although this is ridiculously pricey, it is an amazingly effective leave-in moisturizer.  It does not make my extremely curly dry hair the slightest bit gummy, tacky, or weighed down, and it lasts for at least a couple days, so you don't need to be terribly concerned about dryness between washings.  I use a fairly large amount in my palm before gel.  If it's not a ""style day"" for me, I follow up with oil.  Otherwise, after the Leave-In Decadence, I use defining gel and use the MirroCurls after my hair is dry.  I love this product.
"
"
As a long time Amazon-Deva customer, I can say that from time to time you get a dud product. It’s the price you pay for not paying salon prices. So either this product was super expired, or they replaced the contents of the bottle with lice shampoo—it has the same scent and consistency. And if you’re a true curly girl like me, that imagery alone should have you looking towards the Heaven in Hair (which I use as a leave in conditioner and HIGHLY recommend) or sucking it up and purchasing this at Ulta if you really want to give it a try.
"
"
I love deva curl products, but I'm not sure I will buy this one again. The pump came broken, and the product doesn't seem to be that amazing to justify the price. The broken pump is especially a pain in the ass because I work in Afghanistan and use a community bathroom, so it's more of an inconvenience than if I was at home. I'd go with the curl cream if you're looking for a leave in.
"
"
Been using this for months and found it cheaper here than at ulta. If you have curly hair dont hesitate buy it! It smells like floral mixed with a creamy, sweet milk! I know that sounds odd but it is such a heavenly scent thats not overpowering. The consistency is like a  gel cream which I love. My hair can get weighed down with typical black hair care products and this is the perfect level of moisture an curl definition. I am jamaican but my curls are closer to more of a domicican curl pattern so this product is very versatile. My only con is I wish the bottle was a smidgen bigger.
"
"
This product is expensive for my needs, even though I love DevaCurl products. I find that the DevaCurl decadence conditioner works better for my curly dry hair. It is nice for a change as it is so easy to use, but for e everyday use, I will stay with the regular conditioner.
"
"
this smells horrible and is expired or is a bottle filled with the wrong thing - dont order it :/ always wanted to try this stuff out but this is definitely NOT it
"
"
I get far better results from using the One Condition Decadence as a leave-in. This doesn't do anything for me. It disappears into my hair (3A-B, very fine and dense, low porosity). Maybe it has something to offer those with a thin head of hair and loose curls/waves, but even then I can't imagine that it would possibly be worth the price.
"
"
I didn't like this product. It's not moisturizing. It left my hair hard to brush and tangled. It felt like gel. I wouldn't buy.
"
"
I use a variety of Deva products, and this one is perfect for my daughter's texture. I put it on and follow up with the Deva gel... perfect curls and controls frizz.
"
"
I am using Devacurl products for about a month only. But I do love them all. This conditioner is great for my 3b low/medium porosity hair type. So if you guys need to moisturise your hair it is right product.
"
"
I have loose curls, and this is the best conditioner I’ve found. I have used other Deva Curl products but they are too heavy. This leave in conditioner works awesome.
"
"
What a wonderful product to have. My hair feels very soft and manageable..
"
"
I have curly hair and I use this as a leave-in when my hair is wet and before I put styling creams in my hair. It works great.
"
"
I love Deva curl products. This is an awesome product. A little goes a long way. I will purchase again.
"
"
Good product . Very nice texture & consistency . Leaves my hair looking good .
"
"
My daughter’s hair is soft and curly! This product brought back the nice looking curls to her hair. No fuzziness anymore. I’m using it with the light get as well. Love it
"
"
I find the cost of this item too high. It's just like any other leave in conditioner. Not impressed.
"
"
Not as much slip as I'd like. Curls are 3c/4a. Can't tell yet if its moisturizing enough.
"
"
Love it - makes my hair manageable and easy to style!
"
"
This tames my natural curls with just the right amount of moisture - not heavy at all but nurtures my hair.
"
"
I love deva curl no poo and conditioner not this leave in conditioner. Not creamy enough for my hair.  Pricey💰
"
"
The best product I have used in a long time for my ringlet curl definition.
"
"
Wish it was cheaper but this stuff is great !
"
"
Was ok, not better than a more affordable leave in
"
"
I really like Deva Curl leave in Conditioner. It’s light, no build up, not greasy, no frizz, gentle with curls.
"
"
Did not weigh my hair down seemed to enhance my curl pattern.
"
"
This product leaves my hair soft and more curly
"
"
very happy with my purchase
"
"
Expertly packed to prevent leaking. I'm very happy with all of my Deva Curl products.
"
"
This stuff is great. Came packaged well.
"
"
A+ product
"
"
perfect ......
"
"
It’s  totally the opposite of what I was looking for.  My daughter has very dry curly hair and this only gave her hair a dry crispy look. This feels like gel and we all know that curly hair doesn’t want anything to do with gel. I have tried the styling cream and its much better.Please correct me if I’m maybe using it in the wrong way. Its a leave in !! That’s it.
"
"
Did it’s job but sort of expensive for the amount of money spent.
"
"
I would not want to leave this in my hair. This is the first of the devacurl products that I did not like. I would rather leave the decadence shampoo in my hair, than this!!!
"
"
The first two times I used this product on my toddler's natural, thin hair, dry curls, I didn't really notice a difference. However, after about the 4th time, you can really see a huge difference.  Her hair is now super silky and it forms ringlets naturally.  I have washed her hair about every 3-4 days.  Today I was able to run a brush through it in about 5 strokes, where I normally spend about 45 mins detangling it.  The brush makes a difference too, though.  The product smell is a bit odd, like soap concentrate, but it doesn't leave a strong smell behind after rinsing. I will put up with the smell for the results. I haven't used the towel yet.
"
"
You are better off buying the shampoo/conditioner on the DevaCurl website. They have sales pretty often and then after you spend a certain amount, you get free samples or a free Deva Curl towel. The towel that comes with this set is marketed as the original Deva Curl towel (grey, bigger than a hand towel, and very nice microfiber), however what you get is a dumbed down version for Amazon that is smaller than a hand towel (see picture) and is cheap like the microfiber cloths you can use to wash your floors. I’m disappointed in the deceiving marketing and Amazon accepting such a cheap product replacement.
"
"
So I decided to try this because my hair was all blah and not looking good when air dried. I use to wash EVRY day because I go to the gym and of course my hair gets all gross. I heard about the curly girl method and decided to give this a try. I bought the one for wavy hair! OMG let me tell you!! I just got my hair professionally cut and dyed about four days ago and washed it for the first time this morning. I was skeptical because the shampoo didn’t foam like the others I am used to. I rinsed and conditioned and followed up with the recapture whip, plopped for about ten minutes and let it air dry. The left is this morning and the right is after running almost four miles sweating with it tied up.. omg!! Love this!! Highly recommend and will be buying more of the products. I have my eye on the set it free spray.
"
"
i have been using hair iron on my curly hair for a few years now because my curls were terrible. I am determined to get my natural curls back and many have advertised this product as a miracle working product. So I decided to try it, and from my experience, it didn’t live up to my expectations. My curls still look terrible but what i love about this product is that it helped hydrate my hair, it did not feel greasy or stiff like some products i tried. The smell is nice, so i think this is nice for people who already have nice natural curly hair and not for people who want to revitalize their curls back to life. Lol
"
"
For all those who are trashing the towel, it clearly states on the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION and BOX, that it includes a MINI towel. That's why this bundle is affordable and for those who want to try the curly girl lifestyle before they spend $$ on liters of conditioner.I received exactly what was described and shown: 1 mini Deva towel, and two 8 oz bottles: 1 of low-poo original, and 1 of one condition original.Product came in one day, package unharmed and unopened. Choose your sellers wisely, do your research. Then you won't be disappointed when you receive fake garbage.

I am a product junkie. I recently went in for a baylage coloring. I wanted a subtle brown because I have thick curly hair and already experienced my hair breaking off after dying it blonde when I was younger. Anyway, the beautician left the bleach in to long and woe to me super blonde baylage. I immediately started researching what to do to dmsave the locks I spent years regrowing to such a great length that i was sure I'd have to chop off. Stopped straightening, weekly deep conditioning, and my hair not broken off at all. But, those baby curls I had growing up were gone! My hair just looked like sad wavy half twisty shapeless. I read about devacurl and gave it a go. Along with fingertwisting and just curly girl TLC I revived so much curl. And this set just leaves my hair looking touchable and soft, unlike other product that have your roots greasy or hard. I really love it.
"
"
First, the con.  The microfiber towel is the size of your average bar towel, smaller than a kitchen towel.  There is no way to wrap it around your head.Now the pro.  This product is fantastic for thirsty frizzy curly hair.  It doesn't have a strong fragrance.  It is thick and penetrating.  Perfect for my unruly hair.  It is gentle enough that it does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin (other products have caused break out and rashes).  I'm very pleased and would order again.
"
"
I tried this product for a month before writing a review to make sure I allowed time for build up to be removed from my hair and to give this enough time to work. I have not noticed any difference at all. My hair is still pretty frizzy, and my waves are not discernibly different. I do like the smell of the shampoo (low poo), which smells like calming essential oils to me, but other than that I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it, especially for how expensive it is. It is no better than much cheaper shampoos/conditioners.
"
"
Trying to grow my curly hair longer..first time in 30 years,,,this shampoo and conditioner  is helping keep it untangled..love it
"
"
After reading reviews and watching videos on YouTube, I decided to order this set. Wow, what a great product. The towel works great to scrunch your hair and control frizz. Loved the way my hair felt after the No Poo and the Conditioner. And no, the No Poo doesn't suds, but you don't need it to. Still cleanses great and encourages natural curl.

I had such high hopes for this shampoo.  I read the Curly Girl book and just assumed this shampoo/conditioner would be perfect.  Unfortunately, it made my 2A/3A/3B  curls/ringlets very undefined and my hair felt very greasy and sticky.  It weighed my hair down so much that I just had waves.  I tried the Cantu shampoo/conditioner and it works so much better!  So, switching back to that one.
"
"
I've used other no lather type shampoos and generally a condition is not required since it's kind of an all in one. With this product, I cant understand why a no poo and then a conditioner.  My hair feels clean, light and bouncy, and generally hydrated. Not as good as my other stuff.  I still use my standby of leave in cream by Mark Anthony along with a moroccan oil after towel drying.  The microcloth is a bit of a joke. I see a very very nominal difference between a cotton towel and this.  A cotton towel will absorb better than this.  I like the product very much, but the smell well, it makes me think of a very lemony urinal cake.  I love lemon, but this is not quite right.  It doesn't stink, but they need to tweak the scent a little.  I will keep looking for a replacement for my old standby that has been discontinued, but meanwhile it's a keeper.
"

CLEANSING CONDITIONERI am new to the curly girl method but I've had friends recommend other products since I bought this. I have a lot of hair (short but thick) and it takes a lot of cleanser to get it clean. I wash my hair every 3-4 days and in a month I've used 1/4 of the bottle. The last product I used a bottle lasted the full year, and it was a smaller bottle. It might be worth it if you have thinner hair but I end up in a cycle of add product, massage into roots until it won't spread anymore, add product, etc. I'm trying to stretch the bottle out and not use more than necessary but it takes forever to get my hair clean.CONDTIONERIt does it's job but I've had better. It feels a little thin/watery and it's not great for detangling. I detangle with my fingers in the shower but otherwise don't brush my hair. My hair doesn't get too knotted between washes but devacurl does a noticably worse job than other products I've used.TOWELBefore I bought this I read so many bad reviews about the towel. I didn't care about the towel, I purchased this kit to try out the products, but I can't ignore it in my review.I'm not a fan. I have shoulder length hair and I can't wrap it in this towel. Also, I always use microfiber camping towels on my hair and they work much better. They are thin in comparison to this plush one and I think they create less frizz. I only use this towel when my others are dirty and I need to do laundry.
"
"
I used this product as directed and have to say that it does not work on my type of hair. Any product that leaves my hair hard and not so good to comb through is not suitable for me. Even when I used the conditioner, it left my hair a little hard and not easy to manage. I only had it for a couple of days, but first impressions are the key. I will not recommend this product at all. It just doesn't work for my type of hair.
"
"
it feels and smells fantastic but my hair was super tangled when I was washing it. I think I need products that are bit more moisturizing. So I'll be returning this and ordering the Devacurl Decadence kit.
"
"
I got a perm in my hair and decided to try Deva Curl to keep the curls curly. This cleanser is so much easier to use than regular shampoo. I wet my hair apply the cleanser, run a little water over my head to spread it out and then make small circles on my head to move the cleanser through my hair on my head. Then gently let it run through the rest of my hair. My hair is clean and it doesn't get tangled. Then I use the conditioner and then do a quick rinse through leaving some on my hair. I found the curl cream keeps the curls better than another brand I tried. All together works well.
"
"
If this review was for the conditioner alone, it would be an easy five stars. I got this as sort of a sample kit for myself because I wanted to try the products & towel to see if it made a difference. I can't say as the towel makes a huge difference & the cleanser, acting in place of shampoo, is just basically a less intense conditioner product and as expected if you wash your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo, your hair will be limp & greasy looking by day two. All that being said, I'm hooked on the conditioner. Any product that is so amazing I can just run my fingers through with it in the shower and actually completely detangle my long, curly hair has me for life. My hair feels like hair after I use it instead of making it feel like straw like with other products. So-and this just me-I have found I need to use actual shampoo for my roots if I want some volume, so I alternate; some days I'll shampoo w/ an actual salon quality shampoo such as if I'm going out or my hair is feeling extra greasy, then follow with the DevaCurl One Condition. If I'm staying in, I ""wash"" with any conditioner, then again, always follow with the DevaCurl conditioner. So I got what I want out of this little kit; I discovered what is worth sticking with and what isn't. From now on, I'll buy just the conditioner and in bulk!
"

Ever since having my baby 5 months ago, my scalp has been so irritated (probably due to hormones) so I was curious about the ‘no shampoo’ method of washing hair. I specifically got this product so I could test it out for a month or so (based on turn size of product) vs committing to purchasing larger bottles.The size of the bottles are great!!!!The towel size is perfect for ‘scrunch drying’; after doing that for maybe 30 seconds? you don’t need to put your hair in a turban to dry at all!I purposely also did not my ANY product in my hair post shower and let it air dry so I could see how frizz-free it would really be and, WOW! I even had lunch in Florida in the heat and wan unaffected but frizz. I am VERY excited to use this product again!!!!
"
"
This is fake!! It takes me 20 minutes just to comb through my hair after using this product.  It left my hair dry and more tangled than it was before I used this.
"
"
I have natural curly hair, well before this stuff natural fizzy hair. Nothing has ever helped as much as this stuff. I love it and that I can use it every day is even better. My hair actually looks better if I use it every day versus every other. It does not dry out my hair. I am use to no poo shampoos so the fact that it has no lather is not a big deal for me. My hair has never been soft enough to finger comb it and now it is.
"
"
I bought this set because my hair was super dried out. My hair is mostly straight, with just the tiniest curl under the right conditions, so I didn't expect it to help with that.  But it did add a lot of moisture to my hair. Because it doesn't lather, it also forces you to really give your scalp a nice rub down, too. Overall, I really liked it and would recommend! I will say though, that even after months of using only this, I still found that my hair was a little more oily overall. I generally wash my hair every 2-3 days and with this I had to wash more like every 2 days if I really wanted fresh hair. It also didn't seem to work as well with blow drying, but with air drying (my usual), I had some nice volume!
"
"
 If u have curly/ frizzy/ crazy hair this is seriously the best product ever !!! I’ve been using devacurl for the last few years and I love it soo much . Worth every cent !!! I had t tried this product so I love the 8 oz size . The towel is also amazing!!! Best on the market, hands down!
"
"
Do not waste your money on this. I bought it because of the pictures and how great the models hair looked. My hair was freezy and the curls were not as defined as when I dont put anything in my hair.
"
"
I love these products. Makes my hair so soft and defined.
"
"
I love this product line. It does take some time to get used to no bubbles etc but once you do you can no longer “poo!”
"
"
Didn't notice any difference after weeks of use. The conditioner, I think, is a better one of the two, shampoo makes my hair look oily almost instantly.
"
"
I would give no stars if possible. I was really excited to use this based on reviews and what I've read online. I don't think my hair has EVER felt as dry and unmanageable as it has when I used this. It was awful!! I'm still recovering, trying to do hair masks and extra conditioning. And my curls didn't even look nice :(
"
"
I bought deva curl and after my first use, my hair looked atrocious— not at all what I was expecting. After doing some research, I’ve learned that devacurl products have been causing hair loss and scalp irritation for thousands of women. There’s even an on-going lawsuit against Devacurl for those exact reasons. If you go to the Think Dirty app and type in devacurl, you will see how poorly made and how bad their products are for your hair. Although I haven’t experienced this because I have only used it twice, there are plenty of videos on YouTube and groups on Facebook that have people attesting to this. All I can tell you is to do your research.
"
"
Be careful I bought this a couple of months ago and started using it and bought more products because it did initially make my hair look good. Soon after my hair became dry and it started falling out. After looking into it I found out that they have a lawsuit against them because so many other people were dealing with hair loss. I also checked the product on think dirty app and the devacurl products are very dirty and filled with toxins. Save your money and buy other products instead of ending up like me and throwing $150+ products in the trash
"
"
Love this nopoo and conditioner. Hair feels clean, fresh and soft. My curls look great after using this. Will rebuy when I am finished.  I also love the little microfiber towel that comes with it too. Very absorbent, no frizz
"
"
I have been using deva products bought from CVS and they have been great but this batch from amazon smells like bleach and made my hair extra dry. Perhaps a bad batch! Awful
"
"
Loved it so much The shampoo makes my hair very lightweight I like it so my hair doesn’t feel heavy
"
"
I’ve been dying to try this product, it’s a little more pricey than your typical shampoo and conditioner but worth it. It’s cakes with that and a microfiber towel which I immediately noticed the difference between drying my hair with your occasional house towel no frizz after damping off excess water off the hair. Very good product for my curls will most certainly look into future purchases with this brand !
"
"
I love how Deva Curl products help my hair to be very curly without frizz,  so these 8oz shampoo & conditioner were good starter sizes. Very disappointed with the towel size which is much smaller than I expected. Gray towel sold on its own claims to be 20x40 in. The one in this kit is barely 15x24 in. which means I can't use it to wrap my head ... only to blot excess water away. I would not recommend this kit.
"
"
I’m enjoying this product so far, seems to do a great job. My hair is not oily or dry and my curls are MUCH more defined. I do have to say it is a small amount of product for a large price in my opinion but this is also the cheapest of the devacurl packages I could find.
"
"
I do not have curls. I have some wavy hair.  However this product added volume to my hair and for that, I like it.  I think the key is to not over rinse the conditioner. I just use as directed except I then style as normally, using a hair dryer.
"
"
I love devacurl products! They make my curls come to life. I have soft, bouncy hair thanks to devacurl products.
"
"
Not good for thin hair. I noticed my hair falling out more soon after I started using it.
"
"
I just used this for the first time and I love it! Not only does it smell great, my hair feels so soft and my curls are so defined and bouncy. I’ve read other reviews stating that their results only got better with more washes, so I’m eager to see how much better it can get! I’m already looking to purchase bigger bottles before this runs out!
"
"
Great for my curls but my scalp did not like these products. Gave me an itchy scalp.
"
"
The product doesnt smell that great and it made my hair feel really heavy and almost greasy. It also didnt really help with my frizz either which is unfortunate with all the reviews I read before buying. :/
"

I worship not love but worship the zero lather cleanser. It’s awesome if girl anyone with a hair type that needs those natural oils in their hair. You have to rinse it well to get any flakes out. The conditioner is ok, I’m going to stick to my holy grail, but the towel is great too. Over all it was a great purchase for me and I’m very happy with it!
"
"
Product has a medicinal scent, which was easily masked with a few drops of essential oil (I like calming lavender, since I shower at night). I've been using this product for a month now, and it's really improved the texture and overall health of my natural ""s-curl"" hair!
"
"
I had high hopes that this would help get my frizzy wavy hair under control. Sadly I was only able to use it once. I am sensitive to smells/fragrances, and this is too much for me to handle.
"
"
Good starter kit for Curly Girl Method but the towel is way too small to wrap around my head. However it's useful for blotting excess water. Too bad as just 6 more inches would have made it perfect for my hair. I do like the shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
The shampoo and conditioner really help my hair - I definitely feel the difference in the texture of my curls and the ""bounce.""  I love the towel too!!  I was skeptical when my hair stylist said to use a microfiber towel for curls, but it really does make a difference - it's much less frizzy!  My only disappointment is that it's more than I like to pay.
"
"
Works great for curly hair. Struggled for years to find the perfect product for my daughter’s curly hair. Coworker at work recommend this and it’s amazing. Highly recommend!!
"
"
Love this set.  I have been trying to find something that works great with my curly hair, this is wonderful!
"
"
My hairdresser was so upset this product caused my hair to break and dry out I had to have it cut and now having scalp and hair treatments my curls are never going to be the same
"
"
After using this product my hair has been falling out
"
"
The conditioner smellls like a porta potty air freshener. It’s so strong and unpleasant and it stays on your hair all day.
"
"
It seems to take a while before your hair adjusts to the deva system but I like them. Not a fan of the scent but makes my hair less frizzy and holds natural curl instead
"
"
Favorite hair product. I order on a regular basis.
"
"
Exactly as expected. The shampoo alternative worked surprisingly well. I think I like Aveda products for curly hair better but I really liked the value for the money here.
"
"
i use this products for long time i buy from deva curl.com and work perfect for  mebut not this from amazon im not happy at all,i will not buy it again from amazon.
"
"
My hair is loving DevaCurl!  Just started using it about a week ago.  Already, my hair is softer, fuller, and curlier.  My scalp feels comfortable and healthy, not itchy.  I also started using the DevaCurl styling products, and I love those, too.
"
"
Let me start by saying I am a product JUNKY! I cannot go into a store without perusing by the hair care section. I do my best to take very good care of my hair.That being said, I'd already tried devacurl before I bought this kit, so I was aware of how my hair reacted. The no-poo is hands down my favorite co-wash I've ever tried. I love how it makes my scalp truly feel clean after use. I'm not as attached to the one condition, or the towel that comes in the kit. As far as the conditioner, I can tell my hair is softer after using it, but I've gotten similar results with other products. The towel was my least favorite. I have quite a few microfiber towels, and this one is not only the thinnest, but snagged on my hair the most. I could feel it getting caught where my hair is a bit more coarse than the rest. I only use this to kind of ""scoop"" up my hair to bring the pattern out more as opposed to any long term use with my other towels.TLDR; if you've never used DevaCurl, give this kit a shot. If you have coarse hair, watch out for the towel, though!
"
"
I had high expectations for this brand/products but was not impressed. Used for months with no noticeable difference or improvement to hair.
"
"
These hair products make my hair smooth and soft without being greasy, and they smell fantastic! Whether I wear my hair curly or straight, it is much softer since I started using the DevaCurl products.
"
"
Products are so tiny and worth so much money
"
"
This product is horrible!!! My curl pattern has changed completely since using this product. My hair was curling from root to end, now it’s brittle and stringy. I am highly disappointed in the dishonesty of this company. We trust that a product would put effort into an acceptable formula, but Deva Curl has failed. Money is not everything. Deva Curl you are ruining people’s hair.
"
"
This is a great start up kit, especially because of the towel that is included. It’s a decent sized towel for squishing out excess moisture in my curls, big enough to do the job, but still small enough to pack for trips. No more terry cloth frizz for me! Making the switch to these products was easy. I went cold turkey and with no regrets! It helps that they smell so wonderful!
"
"
I brought this product for my teenage daughter. She has beautiful curly, long hair. We have tried numerous products on the market some work, okay most do not. The problem with most products for curly hair is that they are drying, and frizz curly hair. With Diva Curl her hair looks smooth, her curls more defined. Product is five stars.  We both thank you.
"
"
My naturally curly hair was so damaged from coloring and using heat on it that it was loosing most of its natural curl.  After just a couple of weeks of using these products, (and discontinuing using a curling iron) I notice an amazing transformation in my hair. It it so curly, so soft, and so manageable. Thanks Deva Curl!
"
"
Have not used the product yet, so I will update when I do. But, beware. The pictures show the bottles as 12 oz, but they are actually only 8 oz. I should have researched more, but accurate photos should also be used.
"
"
I started using these products about a week ago and my hair feels great.  Nice soft curls.  I like how they had a sample size so I could test the products out before committing to the larger more expensive sizes.
"
"
I have wavy 2b type hair. The conditioner works well and I've been using it for about a month now. As long as you keep a lot of it as a leave-in, it really helps to reduce frizz. The shampoo I am not super impressed with. I feel like it leaves my hair a little stiff towards the roots. The towel I love and I use it every time I shower to dry my hair.
"
"
I guess I expected more? The scent isn’t all that great... I had been using it for a couple of months, and I hadn’t really noticed a difference.
"
"
Didn’t work for me. Maybe it’s just my hair but it didn’t do anything special or different. Pretty sad I hoped this was the product to bring the curlyness to my hair but nah, didn’t work.
"
"
Lost lots of hair in the shower adnormal shedding while using this put my brush through my hair and it was like i had weave just ripping out bottom of my hair was dyed about 4 yrs ago so almost all of my hair is virgin no heat ): sad i liked the way my curls looked i am 16 years old.
"
"
I had high hopes for this as I've seen nothing but good things about it. I never felt my hair was clean, the shampoo was incredibly hard to distribute, and it left my hair feeling limp and oily.
"
"
Product as described and shipped quickly!
"
"
hair has never felt better....light curls, hold style longer and soft not fuzzy curls....amazing product...fast delivery
"
"
This product dried my hair in less than one week.
"
"
Did not do what I expected. Made my hair very dry
"
"
Got this as a gift for two different peopleThey both said that it made such a difference in their curls and they will continue to use the productThis is a perfect starter set
"
"
Got this for my gf and she loves it
"
"
Love how much life it brings to my natural curls
"
"
It is not having the same effect in my hair for frizz and curl shaping as when I've bought the product in a store previously
"
"
Not a fan!!! Makes my hair very greasy looking!
"
"
Best products for curly or wavy hair
"
"
Bought this for my curly haired 5 year old. We’ve only used it one wash & can already tell a HUGE difference. We will be DevaCurl customers for life.
"
"
Not for me. Left my hair feeling greasy.
"
"
Works great for curly hair. You can't beat the price and this comes with a soft towel too. This would make a great gift set for any women who struggle with their curly hair.
"
"
Great
"
"
I have liked each of the products included in this kit. Though the products are pricey, I would buy again.
"
"
Best curly hair products I've ever bought, I'm 45yrs old and tried every thing, this does what it says a d is awesome 👍
"
"
Love it! Wish it was a little cheaper
"
"
Great products for curly hair (that used to be very dry prior to using these products).
"
"
Smells okay. Didn't think it was worth the money though.
"
"
The towels a bit small, you can't trap your head in it like a normal towel, but the shampoo and conditioner are amazing.  I'm converted.
"
"
Why didn’t I do this sooner. Gives curl a healthy boost. It did an amazing transformation.
"
"
I love devacurl shampoo!! My curls are more bouncy and defined than ever! My only complaint is that after a few washes I do see and feel that there is product build up in my hair which means I still use regular shampoo about once or twice a month.
"
"
I have natural curly hair and this product has dried it out. I the only item I intend on keeping from this set is the towel.
"
"
Still trying it out. Not crazy about the smell.
"
"
This stuff is so good I bought the kit to try it and I am in love the conditioner leaves you're hair feeling soft even after you rinse most of it out great buy I love the towel to definitely recommend if you have dry tired curls
"
"
Worth it
"
"
Horrible. I wanted to love the devacurl products but it does make my hair fall out more than usual in the shower. If you do a search on Youtube and Google about the pending lawsuit you will know what I'm talking about.
"
"
The bottles were bigger than I expected and it works great. My hair isnt dry and frizzy at the roots like it usually is. Plus it came really early. The only thing wrong with it was that the towel was packaged outside of the box. But other than that its perfect.
"
"
Works perfectly
"
"
Wish the bottles were bigger. Love all these products!
"
"
I am not convinced this is the original Devacurl products. I have the original products ordered directly from Devacurl, and the texture and smell are completely different. Buyers be aware ...
"
"
Great deal
"
"
I bought this set for my curly hair and with only a little application of product it really brought it to life. Great buy 🙌
"
"
Got this for my girlfriend and her super curly hair. I asked her about this product and she said it works well, and she'll buy it again.
"
"
Just wish for a bigger towel
"
"
Excelente presentación
"
"
Just started using this product not too long ago, but I can tell a difference in my hair. I love this product and I will definitely be buying more Devacurl products.
"
"
Love Diva Curl products! I have t washed my heir with shampoo since I started using Diva Curl!!
"
"
Very good product,
"
"
I love it. Makes my curls and waves beautiful and adds so much body. My friend commented on my hair and now she too loves this product.It was very worth it for me.
"
"
Hair feels good after wash. Liked the towel too! Doesn’t tale the moisture out.
"
"
Works awesome but is too expensive for a single mom
"
"
Awesome product. Towel is super tiny, meant for travel I suppose.
"
"
Horrible product. Drys out hair and the towel is so small you can't even use it to Dry your hair.
"
"
Love this for my wavy and frizzy hair. It gets my hair clean, and I feel like there is less breakage with the towel that is included has something to do with that.
"
"
Keeps my hair soft but greasy as hell and it’s hard to use
"
"
Love the way my curls felt and looked.
"
"
Great for curly hair! Really buy into DevaCurl products.
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
I thought I would love this product but I’m just not a fan of it. It wasn’t for me
"
"
I really love how this leaves my hair soft and clean. The towl is amazing on my hair it’s really worth it.
"
"
Great deal to try it out without having to buy a liter bottle of each. This worked great to revive my wavy hair.
"
"
The conditioner was open and all over the box on the insode
"
"
Didn’t really work for me but I have dermatitis on my scalp so it’s hard to find a products that helps . My sister loved it.
"
"
Great deal and a bonus deva towel!  Great for beginners to this amazing product.
"
"
Love this product. It makes my hair so soft and had nice scent.
"
"
I bought this kit because I wanted to try devacurls product and this was perfect!! I already used it 5 time and I still have like 2 more uses. I love it!
"
"
Best no-poo and conditioner i ever purchased for the curly girl method on my hair. Hair is feeling amazing after using this. 10/10 bought again... but full bottles next time
"
"
I have been using the deva curl shampoo and conditioner.  My hair seems silkier and has less frizz. I would buy these products again.
"
"
Didn’t care 4 it at all
"
"
I am about 2 months in for quitting shampoo and the No Poo is what I can thank for that. My hair is a lot less dry.
"
"
It’s a bit expensive but worth it for good hair care
"
"
Curls spring without the added weight of product heaviness.
"
"
it added so much moisture to my curls !
"
"
Wonderful product. Best shampoo and conditioner!
"
"
Great product for curly hair
"
"
Great
"
"
I can’t live in them anymore!!!
"
"
Everything is just soooo good
"
"
DON'T BUY! There's a big law suit right now about these products making your hair fall out!
"
"
My daughter has curly hair - this makes those curls more bouncy and manageable.
"
"
Diva curl works better than any other. Adds and keeps moisture for curly hair even if you straighten it.
"
"
Very good quality!
"
"
I was so excited to order this product based on seeing pictures on Instagram and YouTube reviews. Honestly I am not sure how they got that kind of results. I have 3C type curls. This product is no different than any other products out there for a much cheaper price. They have done a very good job marketing but I just wish the quality was half as good as they claimed. I do not recommend this product and certainly don’t planning on purchasing again.
"
"
Great product for thick hair
"
"
My hair looks amazing after using this for two weeks.
"
"
Its deva curl, whats not to love.
"
"
I love how it makes my curls look so moisturized.
"
"
It`s making my curls soft and tame.
"
"
Amazing ! So cute and shipping was so fast even with standard shipping, I love this product !
"
"
Great product for my natural 4c hair
"
"
My curls are moisturized and bouncy as ever!
"
"
I was so excited to buy this and all it did was way down my curls. Completely bummed...
"
"
I love this brand for my curls, its expensive but worth it to me (bought it from hubby's account)
"
"
Great products but expensive
"
"
It smells delicious. Ship really fast. Would recommend.
"
"
ITS AMAZZIING YO, i ised to have really really damaged colored hair and i got it cut to my chin and it was still curless but with this!? it was like magic lol my hair was born again
"
"
prompt delivery and wonderful product.
"
"
Good for curly hair
"
"
Smelled awful. Will never buy this again.
"
"
Works Great on My Curly Hair
"
"
Love Deva Curl products! I received the package in a timely manner. No damage. Can't complain.
"
"
Pricey and I found better stuff out there.
"
"
I personally prefer other brands.
"
"
Loved it but it dried up my scalp
"
"
Great product
"
"
Love it!
"
"
The fact that the shampoo doesn't lather and my hair basically absorbed it freaked me out but after I got over that....this stuff is amazing. The smell of the shampoo is a bit weird (kind of minty?) but the conditioner smells like fresh, clean laundry. The towel that comes with it is also the best thing ever. Overall, this product does exactly what it says it will. I don't like how much of the product has to be used (it requires quite a bit per wash) but it's worth it. If you're unsure of you can ditch your traditional shampoo, this is a great kit to try to test the waters.
"
"
Leaves hair shinny lovely smell
"
"
Works great!
"
"
It really smells bad
"
"
good stuff
"
"
The towel was way too small for someone with hair longer than shoulder length.
"
"
Love it!! Really good package for great price!!! Love devacurl!!!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Works amazing no frizz and beautiful curls! I love this product
"
"
My hair looks and feels great!
"
"
Fine
"
"
Great product!!!
"
"
Great
"
"
This stuff works.
"
"
I love deva curl!
"
"
Great products
"
"
👍🏼
"
"
LOVE this stuff!!
"
"
Product was what it was supposed to be and arrived on time
"
"
The shampoo and conditioner is very moisturizing, I like the Decadence much better than the original. My hair feels light, clean, and soft! I'm still adjusting to not having lather but I'm quickly getting used to it.
"
"
I started with DevaCurl for my super thick, curly hair...I was talked into trying a company that is well know, but evidently new to the curl-game.  I liked the new product for about 2 weeks.  I went back to DevaCurl after 30 days of the other product.  Don't plan on straying again from DC!
"
"
It smells fantastic! Have to get accustomed to no lathering but my scalp feels fantastic!
"
"
This stuff is GREAT! I'm particular. I only gave wavy hair, not truly curly. The gel makes it really curly. I feel like a woman with naturally fallen curls. Buy this, watch the .youtube videos and you'll say you've never glad curlers like this in your life either! Whopee!
"
"
Bottles are just too small.  Towel isn't that great either.  Paper towels work better to absorb excess water and leave hair frizz free.
"
"
Have been using this product for 2 weeks and have yet to see any results.It makes my hair smell like laundry detergent.
"
"
Unpleasant odor, deceptively small amount of product, towel is not large enough to wrap all the way around my head and hair.
"
"
Dried my hair out.  Frizzy and unmanageable.  Without question the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.
"
"
Funny smell! It worked the first time then not so much. Would not buy again
"
"
Didn't really know what I was doing. Made my fine hair very oily.
"
"
Not worth it.
"
"
The smell is awful. Smells like lice repellent shampoo and it sticks around. My hair is naturally thick wavy curly and dry. This made it impossible to comb through and gives me that heavy feeling. Left my hair less curly than normal. And it would either make it more dry or feel greasy. I use Redken Soft and it is wonderful on the dryness and curls.
"
"
The very first time I used this kit I thought, ""yippee! I have my hair back!"" but the second time and then for weeks after, my hair just get more and more dry and frizzy. Not for my fine wavy hair, unfortunately.
"
"
Love these products!!! Hair gets conditioned and frizzy gets gone!!!
"
"
Please don’t do this to yourself. It’s really dirty product and it has made *hair loss* of thousands of people.
"
"
This wallet was even better than the picture.The gold is a little brighter than the picture shows and it comes in a super cute package!!
"
"
It is nice but i am not a fan of the smell and i think its too expensive. Coconut co wash is just as good and way less $$
"
"
I like this kit! Since giving up shampoo, my scalp has never felt better! These products leave my hair feeling nice, clean, and moisturized. It stays clean for days, too! I'm not generally a fan of products that smell like rose, but it this is lightly scented, not overpowering at all. The microfiber towel is super absorbent but I wish it was a little bigger. I can't wrap it around my head. DevaCurl has just released a larger towel and I plan on purchasing it.
"
"
Over the last 3 months I have gone on a journey to get my curls back! It's amazing what can happen if you spend a little time researching and actually caring for your natural hair! At first I tried a home remedy, Aloe. I blend up the aloe gel, set it in my hair for an hour and then washing it off. This was great for healing my hair and making it longer quicker, but I knew I was still missing something. My curls! I have this beautiful long healthy hair but my hair was just not bouncing back like I wanted. After watching some hair health care tutorials on youtube, I noticed this product come up ALOT. So I decided to try it out.Oh boy did my hair start to bounce and shine! After a month of using a whole 2 inches from my scalp has become curly like it once was. The rest of my hair is mending and curls are redefining after every wash. My hair is going through one of the best transformations it has ever gone through. I still use the aloe since it is still very good for your hair, and even skin, but this product gave me what I was missing! One rule I am trying not to break is: no heat. I have not applied heat to my hair since the beginning of my journey. I am fully appreciating my natural hair and DevuCurl is helping me do that!The product:The buildup buster is AMAZING. just a quarter goes a long way and really cleans my hair.The no-poo I feel has the same consistency as the conditioner, sometimes I don't want to use it because it feels like I am conditioning twice, but its part of the program so I have opted to use it.The conditioner is lovely and velvety and allows for me to detangle easily.The cream is enough to curl my hair. I usually use curl cream and not gel or hairspray. I prefer the natural look with some frizz, so this product if perfect for my style. I do think it works better then most curl creams I have tried.
"
"
I'm not use to taking care of curly hair, I use to just have perms done.  However, my hairstylist was able to show that I had natural waves to my hair.  She recommended DevaCurl to take care of my curls.  I liked that they had a video on determining which products are right for your hair.  I chose this one to start with and I like the results.  I get a lot of compliments from people.  I'm still getting use to no ""poo"" when shampooing my hair.  But my hair feels great after the conditioner.  I've also bought the Styling Gel that goes on wet hair and you can let it air dry.  Works every time.  Love it!  Would recommend getting their Hair Towel and following the instructions to get the curls you desire.  I love that I can shower and go some mornings when I need to. The curls usually last 2-3 days without washing.
"
"
I have frizzy kinky naturally curly hair and I tried this and the no poo shampoo is weird. I'd rather co wash with conditioner because it made my hair feel dirtier almost and not soft. I like the hair gel it makes it crunchy though I might have bought that separately but the lotion was just ok. This system was definitely not worth the price I paid I prefer herbel esence conditioner for co wash over this. I felt like it was a waste of money but the shipping and packaging was fine.
"
"
I’ve tried this product on two different occasions and was really not impressed either time.  I have fine, naturally curly hair that frizzes easily and this product does not help.I do highly recommend Curly Sexy Hair curl enhancing shampoo and conditioner for fine curly hair.
"
"
I absolutely love this product. It was a little odd for me at the beginning because there are no bubbles or foam. It's more of a lotion. And I was worried I would feel dirty still. But no it is great. Leaves my hair hydrated and soft. I usually have problems with a dry scalp because I have dry skin but this product helps that issue. I just don't know if I can commit to buying it. I may just buy it again and continue alternating between this product and OGX Beauty shampoos.
"
"
Hey hairstylist recommended this stuff because my hair was crazy dry after my pregnancy, and she said between hormones and silicone build up I should try this pack. Love it! Use the builder up buster a few times in the beginning and I use the no poo and conditioner daily. It’s a little pricey so I may do like 4 days on 3 days with another shampoo... we will see how it goes. A little product goes a long way.
"
"
Great introduction to DevCurl's No Poo line without a ton of financial commitment! The scent is lightly floral, not overpowering to me. It has done wonders for my curls! I love it!
"
"
Love! This is exactly the shampoo/conditioner/set I needed! It is definitely made for curly hair and my hair has been doing so well since starting with this set. I recommend this brand to anyone struggling with frizzy, unmanageable or sad curly hair. I will stick to this brand moving forward!
"
"
I had previously used Wen but was looking for a more economically priced product.  I have somewhere between curly and wavy hair and found that with this product my hair was more frizzy then with the Wen.  I liked the idea of the towel but scrunching my hair with it also seemed to make it frizzier.  I will say my hair was very soft when I used this product.
"
"
Wow. I have literally tried everything on my daughters hair. Her hair is coarse, dry and frizzy all the time no matter what we use on it. I will post a before after photo. It is night and day difference after 1 use.
"
"
Love the product. I hate the smell of the conditioner though, it smells like pee. Other than that, I've definitely seen an improvement with my hair, the texture, definition and overall health. I've been using the product ever since I got it about a month ago.
"
"
Bought this for my daughter at the recommendation of her hair stylist.  It works great on her hair and she loves that the towel helps with frizz.  Have ordered this product multiple times now.
"
"
I like this product but maybe for winter better than sweaty summer. I just don't feel ""washed"" after sweating at my farm all day and not feeling my scalp and hair have been de- sweated. I do like the conditioner though
"
"
I used this for the first time the day I received it in the mail. It makes my hair soft but it doesn't help with the curls or frizziness so far. My hair is naturally curly but also naturally dry and that part is what I was hoping it helped with. Maybe the benefit is more with long term use.
"
"
Not a fan of the smell, leaves a strange almost chemically smell... also, this towel is extremely small and you're better off buying one separately, this one is barely able to hold my albeit long, but pretty thin hair.The product seems to do its job but my wavy-curls fall flat after about an hour anyways 🤷🏻‍♀️
"
"
Deva curl is a healthy way to cleanse your hair, my hair is clean but depending on how much other products I use ( mud hair color) I will use other shampoos but that is rare
"
"
The towel is TINY, not even half of my, pretty short, hair fits into it, so that was disappointing. The smell of the shampoo and conditioner was horrible and lastly it left my hair feeling greasy and oily.
"
"
Absolutely love this!  My hair feels and looks amazing since I switched from regular shampoo and conditioner to the no poo method.  My hair is really wavy and I like to scrunch it and go, using this product has really helped my curls look healthier and be curlier.
"
"
New big fan of devacurl . Leaving my hair naturally and not burning it with a straighter every day feels good .plus this helps manage it I get so many compliments! This plus the coconut curl styler ❤️👌
"
"
I used it for the first time today.  I smell is amazing and I love the towel!  It really helps dry my hair much quicker.  My hair is super soft and the curls look great.
"
"
I this love product! Buy some for my mama and sissy too! Also, I recently died my hair purple and it has helped my color stay vibrant.
"
"
I was dubious about the ""no lather"" shampoo but I must admit that I've been very pleased with the results on my moderately curly hair.
"
"
Excellent products and great value. Had to return due to allergic reaction (not DevaCurl's fault) ... excellent return experience.  Thanks, DC
"
"
Very pleased, just ordered the 32 oz size of each.  Love the fragrance and the way my hair looks and feels.
"
"
I used this product for about 2-3 weeks and it just did not work for me as expected.
"
"
Learning how to use but so far so good. it is helping me get my curls back and under control.
"
"
I love the no poo and one poo conditioner!! The bonus deca towel is perfect to pack for a trip! I am a deva curl girl for about a year now and won’t switch back!
"
"
This has done wonders for my curls! No frizz anymore and keeps my curls bouncy. Finally the perfect solution for my crazy hair
"
"
I will continue to buy this product and it will be the only one will ever use.  If used properly, it works amazingly!
"
"
Love these products! I have thin, wavy oily hair and this makes my hair look and feel beautiful. I like other scents better from this brand though. Oyhrwise I would have given a 5 star.
"
"
This is the best stuff ever!!! My daughters hair is thick and naturally curly. It was a daily battle to get all the knots out of her hair. The DevaCurl products have saved a lot of tears and frustration. Her hair is now soft and easily manageable.
"
"
Using this product on my platinum flyaway hair. My curls have come back and my hair looks great all day.
"
"
I have used Devacurl conditioner before hence thought of trying the cleanser too. love the product

I looove it so much. I am 27 and don’t know much about my own hair but this is a game changer.
"
"
I really liked how this shampoo made my hair feel but I couldn't stand the smell.  Sensitive nose.
"
"
This shampoo is great for curly or frizzy hair. The towel is a bit small and doesn’t work very well for long hair.
"
"
It keeps my curls so soft and bouncy!!  It took care of my straw-like hair and added much needed moisture and balance.
"
"
So far so good
"
"
Maybe straight hair is developing waves so I would say this works
"
"
Great for my hair
"
"
Love it works great for my hair
"
"
Loved the products but still prefer the No Poo.
"
"
Took some time getting used to and figuring out the right amounts, but love it!
"
"
Fantastic no-poo and daily conditioner!  I really makes my curls well hydrated and long lasting :)
"
"
Didn’t work for me.
"
"
DevaCurl is a great product and it works so well on naturally super curly hair
"
"
I had high hopes for this product but it left my curls flat and limp. The towel it came with was nice though.
"
"
Love this product. My hair is healthier, moisturized and I don't have to wash it everyday now. I have purchased the no poo and no conditioner again already and will buy again. I will never go back to regular ""washing"" again. Very satisfied!
"
"
Bought as a Christmas Present for my Daughter. She loves this product and continues to use.
"
"
Item arrived promptly and as described.  I am happy with my purchase and the towel works great.
"
"
My hair feels dirty the next day and seems to be dryer when I use.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Best shampoo for curly hair. Takes some getting used to the absence of lather but my hair is curly than ever since I have been using DevaCurl products.
"
"
Product promptly and just as described and pictured. A good deal. I will order this item again.
"
"
Love these products.  Great for curly hair
"
"
Love it
"
"
love it,  wish you were less expensive
"
"
Great product, but too expensive to repurchase.
"
"
Left my newly permed hair feeling awesome!
"
"
Best curly product. Smells great!
"
"
Really like the towel!Wish that the no poo and conditioner were bigger.
"
"
Good product my hair looks good
"
"
Used this product for 1 year and found it to be exceptional! It will heal your hair follicles and restore your natural wave. My hair is shinier and every hair dresser remarks how healthy it looks. The only down side for me was after the one year, my hair seemed too oily with this product. Perhaps it healed my hair so much it produced it's natural oil again, but I had to return to my old product to avoid that oily look. I am now alternating. Bought this small set to share to a woman in one of my exercise classes whose hair is not strong.
"
"
Ok I tried this for my daughter that has crazy frizzy, dry, hair. I didn’t notice a difference the first time I used it but today was the third time I used it and her hair is less knotty and dried with less frizz and looks so much healthier. I am going to continue the regimine and I am going to look through more diva curl products!
"
"
Absolutely in love with this product line. My curls have never looked better and I highly recommend giving this set a shot if you're struggling with frizzy misshapen curls. I've let other family members who have different curl types than me try it and they've had great results too.
"
"
I gave this product 2stars and not one because the shampoo did cleanece my hair but was expecting it to moisturize a lot more considering it's a cream cleansing shampoo the conditioner was watered down and did nothing but leave my hair dryer than it was before.
"
"
This stuff made my hair feel even more dry than normal. Also, I couldn't stand the way it smelled.
"
"
Revolutionized our lives! No more tangles in my daughter's hair, and no more tears after bath time. Have already recommended it to many of my friends.
"
"
Guess I'm a sudsiholic. Shampoo works OK. I do like the leave in conditioner though.
"
"
This kit is a perfect starter pack. The shampoo gets your hair clean without lathering, and the conditioner works great. The towel is a little smaller than I expected - you won't be able to wrap it around your head. It's a good size for someone with shorter hair (mine is above my shoulders and the size works well for me) but if you had much longer hair, I could see the towel being a bit too small. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to fellow curly haired people!
"
"
Works well.
"
"
not good for black people hair - makes my hair super dry
"
"
Not working for me. Not bringing my curls back or anything. Just a waste of my money.
"
"
I enjoy this so far, the products work nicely and smells good, but the towel is not for longer hair, I recommend buying a bigger towel if your hair is past your shoulders
"
"
I'm almost 50 and it took me this long to finally find a shampoo for my thick, coarse curls!! Makes my curls defined and feel lighter.. I loooove this product!!
"
"
This made my hair great again
"
"
returned as I didn't like the product.
"
"
I have semi curly hair, fine and lots of it. To have a curly do I used to have to load it with stiff gel. It would be great for one day, and look witchy the next - it was a one event do. Deva is easy on my colored hair. The style looks soft and natural. I have a great curly do day one, and a great waves do the following couple of days.mmy hair loves Deva it is so good for my hair!
"
"
smells horrible
"
"
I really like DevaCurl no poo and conditioner. It does not lather which took me a few days to get used to but that definitely doesn't affect its cleansing power. I love the fresh, minty natural smell and the way it makes my scalp feel so clean & refreshed. Most of all it really helps my long, fine, wavy-curly hair stay soft and frizz-free. The microfiber towel that came with it helps make my waves turn into nice spirals. I just put product in and then use the towel to scrunch my hair and it helps tighten my curls. It actually makes a huge difference. I will buy DevaCurl again and  I would recommend.
"
"
I ordered the wave kit directly through the Deva Curl website. So far I have only used it once. My hair is drier and frizzier than usual. Before I ordered the kit I recently started using the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel after using Mane N' Tail shampoo (once a week) and conditioner. My hair was less dry and frizzy.  As of now I will finish off the kit especially for how much I paid for it and may just go back to using Mane N' Tail before the Deva Curl Gel. I will update later.
"
"
I bought the gel and the curl revizer. I have very thick hair. I have a body wave now, but this stuff is so great it curled my hair by just scrunching. I got it in a sample pack and LOVE it ever since
"
"
Product smells really weird, and didn't do anything for my hair.
"
"
I’ve read so many great reviews for Devacurl products and was so excited to finally try some. What a huge disappointment. The smell was pretty awful and it made my hair look terrible. No definition of curls, no volume, just a stringy stretches out mess. The first picture is my hair normally, just using conditioner and gel both from Walmart. I would not recommend this at all, I probably will not even use the rest of what is still in the bottles. Overall a huge let down and not at all worth the money.
"
"
This stuff is great for curly hair. Watch “deva curl method” videos to learn how to style. Works best with no heat- let air dry and don’t touch curls. They will keep their shape best that way. I use the gel on the days I wash my hair, and the styling cream in single curls to freshen up the next few days.
"
"
I am 58 years old,and I live in Georgia, where it is very hot and humidI washed and conditioner my hair and went to sleep with it wet!I woke up the next morning and could not believe my eyesI had for the first time in my life perfect ringlets and curls with no frizz for the first time in my life !And I was not even trying to fix my hairMy hair was so soft and silkyI just wish I hadn't have had to wait so many years to finally find something that worksI have lots of fine Frizzy curly spiraled hairThank You Jesus I found this after spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on product that does not workWill use this from now on💞💖🙏
"
"
The hold is a bit weaker than I would like, but the set is a life changer as it really takes all variables out of equation ensuring that your curly hair stays nourished, hydrated and well defined.
"
"
I bought this kit because I travel a lot and got tired of lugging my full-sized products with me. I searched online for travel-sized products for curly hair and didn't find very many, even at places like Ulta and Sephora. I was very pleasantly surprised to find travel-sized DevaCurl! I especially like that it comes with both the styling cream and light defining gel - they work very well together and without them I'm a frizzy mess. Now I look professional and polished while traveling for work.
"
"
Nice product with a clean scent.  Works very well on short hair. Nice, defined curls.
"
"
Great product for curly hair and ideal travel size. Got this for my neice so she will have her shampoo when she goes to friends places over night. Product is lightweight on the hair with good curl definition. Helps control frizz. The scents are amazing
"
"
I was not pleased at all. My hair felt dry. I'm glad bought the travel size and not full size
"
"
Wow really unhappy with this product - I don’t like the smell and after using my hair seems worse after almost a month of CGM work.  I of course no longer have the packaging so a return is not even possible.. skip this product - is my opinion
"
"
I loved the devacurl curly stuff even though my hair is a mix between wavy and curly. Now that my hair is longer it made sense to try the wavy stuff thinking it would be comparable to the curl stuff. This review is based on MY experience and I know what works and doesn’t work for me is not the same for other people’s hair.  The wavy products did NOTHING for me. My hair was frizzy and not at all defined in anyway. I also broke out on the skin around my hairline (neck and behind ears, not face) that is STILL broken out after a week. My hair looked bad. I returned the products and will go back to the curly line (which also makes my hair a little frizzy still but does make gorgeous curls).

"
"
I only used this a handful of times because I realized it was drying my hair out a lot! My hair started feeling like straw after a few washes and I had to deep condition and get some coconut oil in it.The conditioner didn't seem to do much at all.I would recommend the wave maker though. I shower at night and I don't even own a blow dryer, so finding a product that works for me is hard. I am able to towel dry my hair and then run this through very lightly to not weigh my hair down and it helps a lot with the frizz and also defines my waves by morning.I didn't like the gel, as it did give my hair a crunchy look.
"
"
Lots of law suits about hair loss. I didn’t believe it - then I stopped using these products and my hair has stopped falling out.
"
"
My son had sampled another brand for curly hair that was crazy expensive.  I had heard great things about DEVA so I bought this for him to try. He loves it all, especially the styling products.  They prevent frizz and are super lightweight.  He said his hair feels softer and cleaner and will now be buying Deva products in full size bottles.
"
"
(1) It made little baby frizzies all over the top of my hair and around my face (2) caused my ends to be EXTREMELY dry and unhealthy looking (3) smelled fine, but nothing that would make me want to buy it. (4) Glad I had this option to purchase small sizes so I could try it out instead of having to buy a full-size product. (5) I won't buy this again!
"
"
It worth the $30 that I paid.  The bottles are tiny and I ended up not liking the way it worked in my hair.  The shampoo didn’t lather at all and the conditioner did not make my hair as soft and natural as I thought it would.  I have used many different products throughout the years for my curly hair. This one won’t be a repeat.
"
"
I've only used the product once, but I can tell the difference. Once my hair was dry, it felt softer and seemed to have more shine then when I normally wash my hair. Purchased the travel size to see if I would like it before buying the full size, but I think i'll go for the full size. There was a review about the smell, but I disagree, I think it smells fine :)
"
"
My daughter who is 12 and has super curly hair absolutely loves this product! Great size for traveling too!
"
"
Very good producta but just last for 2 washes, it's  a sample but pricey
"
"
Product line contains alcohol, which is very drying, was not a good fit for my hair 4c.  Moreover, with the price point and raving reviews, I expected to be wowed, but instead was highly disappointed!!!
"
"
I recently had my hair permed and this product was the perfect starter kit to understanding curly hair and which products to use to maintain the curl. I ended up purchasing larger bottles of this brand.
"
"
Definitely worth the money. The difference in my hair is night and day. I also used Wave maker and Heaven in Hair by DevaCurl while styling along with the DevaFuser (only the attachment not the dryer). Overall the whole line is great.
"
"
I had heard so many great things about deva curl. I have naturally wavy hair and heard and read that this product can help enhance that. I got the product about 2 weeks ago and have only been able to use it twice, it makes my hair so heavy and greasy looking within a day. I can normally go about 2 days before another wash but with this I was having to wash my hair everyday. And on top of that my hair was falling out a lot more than it normally does.
"
"
These products left my scalp burning and ruined my hair. I went from healthy hair to damaged hair. I may just have to cut it off.
"
"
I wanted to try this product line out on my kids hair before commiting to the price of full size bottles.My youngest has super curly hair and more products don't really work well. But this stuff works. Her curls look great. The conditioner is amazing.
"
"
I really like the products and how they make my hair stand up. The only negative so far is that in haven’t been able to get a lasting wash and go style. By day three it’s very frizzy and I have to use a lot of product, basically the same amount I used on the wash day style, to have any longevity between wash days.
"
"
Not sure but everyone seem to notice my hair was different... in a good way.  They thought I died my hair
"
"
Great for travel! Especially love the super cream. Refillable bottles.
"
"
Perfect for traveling! My hair looks and feels so soft and smooth. I bought them all in bigger sizes
"
"
Small. Gel smelt like chemicals. Like a relaxer. Left my hair looking good. Not all day wear tho
"
"
Already a user of This line. Got this for travel of course and was very pleased.
"
"
I love the product! I bought this as away to try the product before buying the bigger bottles. I am for sure buying the full sized products soon. I prefer the styling cream over the gel but that could be my hair type.
"
"
I  love these products. I am in my late seventies with thin hair. DevaCurl has restored the curls and makes my hair so much prettier. Thank you.
"
"
Not much for your money.
"
"
Not a good value for the size only a 1 time use on my grandaughters hair Not enough to make a difference
"
"
I’ve used Deva products for years.  Love them!  This set seems to be an improvement with more curls & more control.
"
"
Great product after 1 week of use; however, the smell is very chemical.
"
"
just got back and this product was perfect for travel
"
"
Love to be able to test this out before buying the full size
"
"
Great products, I took them on a trip recently and my curly hair felt very hydrated and healthy. The smell is wonderful too!
"
"
This product has my hair very frizzy absolutely hate it
"
"
Bought this to try out the products before buying full size. They are easy to travel with, smell great and work great on my semi-curly frequently frizzy hair. Gives nice curl definition and frizz control without weight. Very happy with my purchase. I will buy big size moving forward.
"
"
The shampoo and conditioner work well for my hair. The curl cream and gel do not help but make hair frizzy especially when dry
"
"
The package arrived a day late & the manufacturer's box was a bit crushed due to being shipped in a padded envelope vs a box. But I was happy to find that the products themselves were undamaged, & the price was good. 👍
"
"
Very expensive for what the size of the bottle I got does not work like they say it does my granddaughter's hair is mixed and it does not work at all
"
"
Do NOT buy this product! My daughter, along with thousands of other women, have suffered scalp damage and hair loss and damage linked to this product! Do your research about this product before you waste your money.
"
"
I am loving this set!! Leaves my hair so soft and my curls so beautiful ❤️!!! I gifted it to a friend she loves it too!!!!
"
"
Product made my hair feel greasy and lifeless. Comparatively Ouidad is a much better product.
"
"
It did not work for me
"
"
This product very difficult to use. See no visible changes in my natural curly hair. It does not leave it touchable. I'm very dissatisfied.  Very pricey as well.
"
"
It works just as well as everyone says it does! It's a little expensive for how much you get, but it does work very well!
"
"
I really enjoyed the product it is doing very well on my hair without leaving it dry or casty. I was very disappointed with the way my package was handled during delivery because the box was all beat up thankfully the product wasn’t damaged I
"
"
I love all Devacurl products. First shampoo in along time that doesn’t strip my hair and my hair has felt a lot healthier since I’ve been using their products. Definitely recommend!
"
"
Bought for a trip. 4, 3 oz. bottles for $30! Pretty expensive, but no choice with the carry on rules of the airlines
"
"
Did not like this product...unfortunately made my hair more frizzy.
"
"
Pretty immediately after using the LowPoo, I started experiencing itchiness, and after reading a few more testimonials, a lot of people have the same experience. Will no longer use LowPoo. Jury is still out on the other products.
"
"
They have an AMAZING smell but I thought they would be a tiny bit bigger :(
"
"
My hair is holding its shape better and does not feel weighted down or crunchy. Less frizzy. This is great.
"
"
The travel kits are the perfect way to test the products before committing to buying a full sized bottle of something that might not work for you. I'm loving the products and I'm definitely buying the bigger sizes once I can.
"
"
These products smell like lemon scented bug spray. Definitely not what I expected from a salon product. I’m glad I bought the trial sizes to experiment before I bought all of their products.
"
"
GREAT product.  VERY pricey, but it seems to really work.
"
"
Great little gift! Works great on curly hair!
"
"
Trying out the curly girl method, and I thought this would be perfect. Small size, not too big of an investment. My hair looks great
"
"
I love he way this product works on my daughter's natural curly hair, the scent is nice.  My only negative comment is on the price.  I'm not sure I can afford to purchase this on a regular basis.
"
"
Love this product.
"
"
The fragrance of these was so bad I had to return.
"
"
Grandkids hair is more manageable and works well with mixed hair type.
"
"
I have A LOT of hair. It’s thick and curly too. This was my first time using this product but most certainly not my last. Great for traveling or just trying it for sample.
"
"
My best friend and I always wanted to try it. It’s perfect and makes our curls look defined. If the results keep up, we’ll definitely buy the bigger bottles
"
"
I returned before using due to reviews that claimed hair loss due to new formulation of product.
"
"
Good products!
"
"
All of these products are amazing for curly hair. I love the cream for styling- I dont even need to blow dry my hair with this stuff.
"
"
I highly recommend this product ! I absolutely loved it . They are the perfect size to travel . They have helped my hair get back to their natural curls again .
"
"
This product does not work at all. I’m extremely disappointed and glad I only purchased the trial size
"
"
I love these products!! Deva curl keep on keeping on please :) the kit is definitely 5/5
"
"
I used this to try out DevaCurl on my daughter before we bought the full size.  Loved it!!
"
"
Finally, a product that understands my curly head!!!
"
"
The shampoo smelled horrible and felt like it was burning my scalp.
"
"
Loved this set for trial of the products! Worked great for my step daughter with corkscrew curls!
"
"
Me encanto el producto
"
"
Perfect travel kit!
"
"
Great
"
"
Great way to try this product before investing money into large sizes
"
"
From the smell to the curls .. I could not be happier
"
"
I really like the product it actually work better in my toddlers hair or make his curly shine!
"
"
Love the Devacurl products and this was a great collection of travel sized products.
"
"
Nice packaging, all product you need for s trip
"
"
They are damamged
"

Perfect for travel. Works for my wavy hair.
"
"
Perfect for curly hair!
"

Horrible
"

Works great!

good

My daughter bought me this kit from sephora. I never write reviews but I am so disappointed in this product. I have wavy curly hair 2c 3a curls. The smell of the shampoo and conditioner is terrible. It reminds me of being sick with the flu for a week and the smell of all the meds seeping out your skin but way stronger. The conditioner didnt even have good slip.  The cream was a little better but not much. For the price these products are just not worth it. If you want a good product the lus brands are awesome. I dont care for the leave in cream but thier shampoo and conditioner are wonderful.
"
"
I'm not sure but I didn't have the problem before I used this....but my hair is falling out at an alarming rate.
"
"
👍🏻
"
"
I have 2b-c curls .  My hair is fine and very thick.  Deva Curl products did what they said they'd do--but I didn't get a ""wow"" factor with the results. Also, they are way to pricey $$$$$!!! However, there are so many other products that put them down a few notches.  The other products I tried were so much better and way cheaper too. And did give an OMG- WOW factor. Such as: All About Curls by Zoto (Sally's carries this and it is very reasonably priced).  I LOVE all their All About Curls Products.  Another must have is JesseCurls--these products works wonders and they'll send you as many free samples as you want! And their products are so much more affordable than Deva-Curl.  Go to JesseCurls website and they have how to videos and advice and you can pick out what scents you want your products to be--they have scentless ones too.  Also I cannot live without Uncle Funky's Daughter Curl enhancer (it's speedy but worth every $$). This stuff works miracles!
"
"
I feel like the best way to share feedback on this product is through a picture so you can see my hairs texture- it’s course, wavy and suuuuuper frizzzyy!! So I used this travel pack to go to Thailand and I would say, SUCCESS!
"
"
I bought the  DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go kits and I love the products. The great news is, if you follow the directions on the bottles, you only have to use a little of each product and the results are great. My curls more pronounced and held in place and my is still soft and bouncy.I highly recommend this product for your natural curls.
"
"
Nope...didn’t work and I followed the directions to a T.  Why do I always fall for these type of products.  P.s.  there’s enough product for maybe three uses if you have medium length hair.
"
"
My hair feels so lightweight and smells amazing!If you use the defining gel, be mindful of how much you use because if you use too much it can feel crunchy.The styling cream is amazing and the no poo and conditioner is great too.The travel size so far has lasted me 2 weeks and it's a great way to see if Deva curl products are right for you!
"
"
I have loose curls and, in my personal opinion, this product does not work for me.  My curls did not respond to the product as expected, no better than some cheap product I am presently using.  The scent is great, the cleanser and conditioner are good but I just don't like how either the gel and/or the cream worked with my curls. I have a friend who loves the product but she has super spiral curls and they look great!
"
"
This is a great collection of sample sizes to either try--or to use for travel. In my case, I purchased them to try which products work best on my daughter's hair... and then reuse the small sizes for travel. I like the Deva line of products, but you may need to try a few to see which works best for you.
"
"
I’m trying this product for the first time. The smell could be a lot better but it’s ok. I have very curly hair. I’m looking for a product that will define my curls. The conditioner is nice. Need product that will not frizz!!
"
"
I love Deva but this is not your everyday shampoo/conditioner. This set was perfect for travel. This is more of a weekly use. Love the gel and super cream. It’s great for curls!
"
"
Didn’t do much for me
"
"
My hair was fluffy and soft, but the gel provides no hold or frizz control. Rewashed the next day and used in combination with my other products. Will attempt to use one more time by itself before I decide to keep or return.
"
"
does not wash hair at all. shampoo feels like a conditioner
"
"
I traveled abroad and this set is great. Size is convenient.
"
"
Great products for curly wavy hair. Keeps the curl without stiffness
"
"
Love the shampoo and how it smells!  The conditioner not as good, but very good for my hair.  My stylist recommended.  She was right!
"
"
Works great for curly thin hair
"
"
These products work great. Easy to pack.
"
"
This stuff is awesome!!
"
"
Love this product! My hair has never felt more clean. It exfoliates my scalp giving me healthy hair that grows!
"
"
Love this stuff!
"
"
I am so glad I found this product! My hair looks like it should!!! Curly!! The one condition, super cream and arc angel gel saved my hair life!! Thank you for a wonderful product!
"
"
These products solved all my curly hair issues.  I absolutely love them.
"
"
Great product, smooth transaction—recommend!

Product thins out my hy hair.

Love it easy to use and lightweight
"
"
Love this product, super curls
"
"
Ok, it’s expensive.  But if used correctly it is amazing!  Don’t comb or brush your hair.  Leave conditioner in.  Scrunch your hair and let it air dry.  Your curls will be amazing.
"

I really like the products but the smell of the curl defining cream and gel give me a headache and nauseating.☹️
"

I think there are a few misconceptions about this product. For starters, like all deva products, this really works best on pretty wet hair. Otherwise, it has a tendency to be kinda sticky. The use I have found for this is as a setting spray. I notice that if I use my usual deva styling products (one condition/ supercream / ultra gel) my hair becomes more frizzy by the end of the day. However, if you spray a LITTLE amount of this on the hair after all the styling is done, it works great at setting everything and creating a better “cast” I guess at shielding the elements from your style.If you use too much of this, it will not only become sticky, but it will weigh down on the hair and affect volume. 4-5 sprays of this is all you need : front, back, left and right. I suggest to try applying all of your styling products in the shower (or just have a spray bottle handy to keep the hair wet) and then after using a devatowel to get rid of excess water, give your hair a few sprays of this. You might find that it helps your style last longer.Edit:Recently I have been using this product to replace the regular gel from Devacurl. On days where I don’t want to use too much product, I will simply saturate my very wet hair with one condition, use a devatowel to get rid of excess moisture, and then spray this immediately afterwords (the hair should still be damp). It works similarly to the ultra defining gel but I find that it produces a more lightweight result which I quite like.

Great product for building curls. A little goes a long way!  Use sparingly on wet OR dry hair or your hair will be stiff and crunchy.  Also, leaves a sticky residue on bathroom floors and cabinets after spraying.  Cleans up easily with a wet Clorox wipe or other type of cleaners.

I have coarse, heavy and thick (a LOT of it) hair, and the biggest problem I’ve ever had was the weight of it pulling out the curls.  However, using this has managed to help me boost my natural curl and keep it looking fresh all day without it being the rigid, stiff “wet” look of the late 80s and 90s.  In fact, I was trying to straighten my hair recently, and my hair stylist commented that my hair was simply “holding in moisture” which was preventing a complete straightening.  (Which isn’t a bad thing - I had smoothed hair that was still voluminous and full.). I’ve recommended this product to all my friends with similarly textured hair, or those who have daughters with similar hair.  Definitely one of the few products over the course of my lifetime that actually helps to maintain my mane.

This product came recommended by a friend who has hair similar to mine.  I have soft curls and I found this product too ""crunchy"" for my hair, I don't like it feeling stiff and sprayed.  I would say that this product is for people with thicker or more coarse hair.  This is the only Deva product I have tried so maybe it works better mixed with other Deva products.
"
"
I have used this forever, and I still love it!  I have fine curly hair.  I only wash it a few times each week.  This stuff keeps my curls in shape if I put it in a top pony to sleep!  Love it!
"
"
I love this stuff. I have 2A/3A curly hair that I wear natural every day. I use this in combination with Bounce Curl gel/cream, and I get great results. This stuff will leave a ""cast"" that you will have to fluff out, but the hold, frizz control, and volume it adds is worth this step to me.
"

Paid $15 for a bottle of DevaCurl Spray Gel. Was really looking forward to using the product, but the spray nozzle is broken. Tried to contact the seller, Specialty Skincare, but only got an automated reply saying they got my message and will respond, but nothing after 2 weeks... With the defective spray nozzle, I cannot spray a proper mist. So I've tried to place a small puddle in my palm to use the product, but I don't think it works the same in that manner, at least not based on the other reviews. This way, it is goopy and ways the hair down. Does not do anything to help curls at all. The cheap bottle of Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl-Boosting Mousse that costs only 1/5 the price of this gel worked so much better.
"
"
Has a nice smell. Some days I have great soft defined curls and some days my hair looks and feels crispy. Although I haven’t tried it with the shampoo set. And it’s a decent size bottle for the price.
"
"
I am not sure if I’m using product correctly. I am going to try to use more next time as I have a lot of hair . It does hold a curl but my hair felt a little dry . I’m not a huge fan of hair gel for this reason but someone else raves about it and so I bought it .
"
"
I've been using this line for 20 years when it was still owned by Lorraine Massey (it's now owned by L'Oreal).  But, I love it still and it makes my curls soft, bouncy, manageable and beautiful!  I love it.  You have to play around with it and know how to use it.  I have tried others and have always come back to this line.  Highly recommend.

The way my hairdresser describe this to me, who is a devacurl stylist, is that this is the light defining gel a little bit lighter in spray form. I really enjoy the spray form because it's easier to apply. I combined it with Be-Leave-In. I have fine, naturally curly hair and this works marvelously.
"
"
I used to use only the Mixed Chicks hair care products, but this is the second product (the first was the DC cleansing serum) I’ve used from the DevaCurl product line and I think I’m enjoying the mixture of the two lines! This gel is lightweight and doesn’t weigh my hair down. It smells good but isn’t too strong! It also seems to work well with my leave-in conditioner (MC). You don’t need much of it to do the job either. For those who do the hair typing, it works great for my hair, and I have a mix of all the 3s (a,b,c).
"
"
I have thin fine hair. I use their other products as well.  I spray it on the bottom ends of my hair and it waves right up without weighing it down.  And the smell is heavenly - all of their products smell fresh and clean!
"
"
My tight curls love this product! I add a generous amount and air dry for 30 minutes before using my Deva dryer to diffuse and shape.
"
"
Do not buy this! After a month, I have uncontrollable itching and dry scalp. I have since found out many others have had the same problem. There is even a Facebook group just for people who have hair loss and scalp/hair damage from these products.
"
"
For curls in my hair. Dries too hard & too hard to spray does'nt seem to be Deva Curl  quailty. My Deva curl shampoo & conditioner was thin as water was'nt like what I purchased @Ultra very disappointed w Deva Curl companies I purchased from on line.
"
"
This is a great product for touching up curls, it must be used lightly. It does make your hair a little stiff, but it's great for that second day curl.
"
"
Great for curly hair that does not respond to ""anti-frizz"" labeled items.  Price is really high though...
"
"
I gave this a 3 although I do like the product It doesn’t come out as spray it comes out as a stream which I was very disappointed my daughter bought one also in the same thing so it’s not just mine I will be contacting the company
"
"
Made my fine curls come to life. Only peoblem is I went through one bottle roo quickly.
"
"
Cannot go wrong with Deva Curl products. I love what Deva Curl does for my natural curly hair. I also love that I can use it on dry curls.  Also, the pricing versus my salon, is a big savings.
"
"
Great product for curly hair. Made my curls even more curly
"
"
liking all the deva products I have tried...this is my newest...and works well...as I said...I spray into my hands and then scrunch...
"
"
It's really hard to tell how well this product would work if I were able to actually spray it on my hair. It's to thick and sticky for the spray nozzle so that it is perpetually clogged. I don't recommend.
"
"
Followed directions. Rinsed thoroughly. My wavy/curly hair was limp and straight-ish after use.
"
"
Love this!
"
"
I have more wave than curl and this weighed my hair down and it felt greasy at day 2. I can see it being good for those with more texture to their hair.
"
"
It didn't give me curls as advertised, but it made my hair dry like straw.
"
"
Use this on my hair for an extra little curl control!!
"
"
Love this spray gel.  It gives definition without being sticky or heavy.  The perfect product to give curls a boost.
"
"
This spray gel works well to give more body to limp fine hair.
"
"
Giving this one 3 stars. Product is legit however it is not lightweight. I have 3b curls and if you don’t wash your hair every day this product makes your hair extremely tangled even with sleeping with silk/satin pillows.
"
"
All was great
"
"
Great lightweight hold. Definitely lighter than the gel
"
"
Great product
"
"
Did not like it at all no good
"
"
Great for natural hair
"
"
My wife purchased these products and has loved them for her wavy hair.
"
"
I used base products and then usually added this on day 2 to rejuvenate my curls. Works great.
"
"
Brings out the life in my hair.
"
"
I have mildly curly hair and live by DEVA products.
"
"
I love this brand and was excited to try this product.  It gives great definition to my curls without any crunch.
"
"
This product contains no ingredients to do more harm to curls but it helps provide a layer of frizz fighting that is light but effective.
"
"
Comes out in a jet stream so I have to spray into my palms and spread on hair...causing frizz
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Didn't do much for my hair type which is 3...
"
"
Love it
"
"
Love this for my curly frizzy hair!
"
"
Did not work for my hair— sticky and did not curl.
"
"
This product definitely does define curls, however every time I use it I notice my hair is very dry afterwards.
"
"
I actually dilute mine into another bottle to make it last longer or me. Works just great as my finishing spray. Not crunchy at all and manages frizz while adding curl power.
"
"
Best product ever for fine frizzy hair.
"
"
Does not spray. Only a pinpoint stream  - I cannot use it. Returned.
"
"
Súper buena , estupenda, mi pelo quedo encantado
"
"
I have a little bit of wave in my hair, but I wanted more curls. I sprayed this gel on my dry hair and scrunched it a bit---and wow! tons of curls! Love my new style.
"
"
Doesn’t boots curls and leave hair crunchy
"
"
I use this to restyle 2nd or 3rd day hair. It gets a little crunchy and heavy so a little goes a long way.
"
"
I like it, it does just what it said it would do.
"
"
Pretty good
"
"
This damages hair and there is a class action suit being filed.  Please can I return this? I also bought the Devacurl. Wave Maker and the No Poo Decadence Milk Cleaner
"
"
I love this brand of curl product there are 3 sprays by deva curl that I use and love for my natural curly hair
"
"
Great product for all hair types.
"
"
This is a great product to refresh second day curls. Make sure to moisturize your curls first. I like to spray it into my hands and then scrunch curls
"
"
I have natural curly hair with a lot of frizz and this product helps control the frizz and curls. I have tried many products and this by far is my favorite.
"
"
It worked well for my curly hair, really like this product.
"
"
This is not good. Makes your hair feel dried out, crispy and frizzy.  I wish I could return.
"
"
Love this brand and all their products...
"
"
Love this product! It’s light weight and helps keep the frizz out of my naturally curly hair even on humid days!
"
"
Did not like this product at all. Returned immediately.
"
"
I love Deva Curl products! It leaves your hair soft and not crunchy.
"
"
This wakes up my curls on the days that I don't shampoo. I love, love, love it!
"
"
Love the product
"
"
I ordered two bottles of the spray and both were delivered without the caps.
"
"
Really defines curl shape and doesn’t feel crunchy or sticky after hair dries. Love it!
"
"
Doesn't make hair stiff or sticky. Soft hold for curls.  Scent isn't bad just could be better.
"
"
Works like magic on curly hair and holds the curl. Love this product!
"
"
Have used for some time. Actually promotes curling, especially in fine hair.
"
"
Keeps curls soft, no frizz!
"
"
Great product I love using this product on my hair .
"
"
This product is okay but weighed my hair down maybe for shorter hair!
"
"
Smells great and my hair feels amazing!
"
"
I have used it one time and I love the results!
"
"
The product does help curls
"
"
Great product and service
"
"
Great every day product
"
"
Works great
"
"
Liked it
"
"
Makes my hair crunchy and frizzy, when used in combination with other Deva Curl products made my hair fall out and stripped the color.
"
"
Deva Curl has replaced their Deva Curl Spray Gel with this Curl Maker stuff and in my opinion it's a mistake - they have changed the ingredients in this product JUST ENOUGH for my hair to know the difference, and it ain't good. Why these manufacturers are always fixing what ain't broke is beyond me - anyway my hair does NOT like this ""new and improved"" version AT ALL and I won't be buying again - very frustrating.
"
"
I love using this spray for my next day curls to revive them! Or if I just need a curl boost!
"
"
I’ve been using Deva Curl for almost 10 years and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  I have fine hair and this mousse is perfect because it is light weight and doesn’t weigh my hair down at all.  I like the deva curl gel (I think it’s called light defining gel these days...) but I gave it up about 2 years ago in favor of this amazing mousse. I flip my head with soaking wet hair after my shower and scrunch out a little water with a T-shirt.  While my head is still flipped I scrunch in with a few pumps of mousse, scrunch out excess water with the T-shirt again and then scrunch in a few more pumps of mousse.  I like using an old T-shirt over the micro fiber towels or a regular towel because they do a better job of removing excess water without taking moisture or product, nor does the T-shirt  disturbing the cuticle of the hair, so curls are soft and defined with virtual NO FRIZZ.
"
"
Be careful, this product does what it says, for the most part. It adds volume and texture. I was able to get more definition of my curls at the root, usually they are pulled straight bc my hair is so long - past my waist. I found it caused more frizz for second day hair. I really could only use it the day I used my cowash, second day hair it added too much weight and frizz, curls just look dirty. Hair feels dirty. It’s not my favorite product; I’m looking for something that gives me the hold, but doesn’t make my hair so heavy and dirty the next day.
"
"
There is a problem with this product in that the gel comes out of the sprayer in a stream. Using the gel would be much more effective if the spray was a mist. I have wavy hair and this product doesn't do much (if anything) for my hair. I'm really not sure what it is supposed to do...create more lasting waves? Maybe? A major disappointment for me is that initially, the Devacurl gels made my hair shiny. After a month of use my hair is dry and dull. This Curl Maker gel might work better on curlier hair - or perhaps as a setting gel.
"
"
not happy at all with the product..  made my hair to dry...
"
"
You should know this gel does not really “spray” out of the bottle. It’s more like a way to dispense the gel which is really too thick to spray on your hair. I spray onto my hand and apply. Not a bad thing, but if you were expecting to spray it on your hair it likely wouldn’t work for you either. Smells very nice and worked as expected.
"
"
This is a thick gel that you have to slather on your hands and put through your hair. It works pretty well for frizziness
"
"
After my favorite hair product was discontinued, I searched for another product.  Although this does hold my curls well, by the end of the day it seems to make my hair feel dry and tangly.  It would be nice if you didnt ALSO have to use a leave in conditioner.
"
"
Deva Curl products are a best friends to men and women Blessed with curly hair.  The Deva Curl lone is a little expensive, however, i can use half the amount of product from other brands and get better results.  I get so many comments on how pretty my fingers are and how yummy my hair smells.  Its well worth the money.
"
"
I love this product!  I use it all the time.  I have curly hair and this product enhances the curls and they are so soft!
"
"
It works beautifully. After washing my hair or on second day, I  re-dampen, put some in my hands  run it through my hair, and then scrunch. After it’s dry I run my hands thru again to blend the curls and I’m done.
"
"
Great product for curly hair, maintained curls, but still felt like the frizz got out of control
"
"
Wanted to love this product line for my long curly hair. Spent tons of money on all of the DevaCurl products and they made my hair frizzy.
"
"
This is the best spray gel I’ve ever used and it enhances my curls, never frizzy!
"
"
This worked great for holding my curl and it smelled good but it didn't really add any extra moisture to my hair. I would order this again.
"
"
Sticky and wirey curls, lost volume right away after applying. Not for me
"
"
I should know better. Deva Curl products do not work on my hair. I have a nice Bumble and Bumble routine that works great, but I get my haircut a Deva salon. My hair looks amazing when they do it. It looks like a flat, stringy mess when I do it. This product just made my curls crunchy. When I ran my fingers lightly through them to break them up, all the curls and wave fell out of my hair and it was just frizzy. Stick with what works.
"
"
One of the best curling products I’ve used in some timr
"
"
This stuff does the job on my waves and it SURE SMELLS GREAT!!!!
"
"
Ok
"
"
Love it
"
"
leaves my hair crunchy.. ok for a quick fix.
"
"
I like this product because it gives me curl without the stiff crunch of other products I've used in the past.
"
"
Great Product, doesn't leave your hair stiff and sticky
"
"
Love it!!
"
"
The smell is not good.
"
"
My hair isn't super curly and this stuff WORKS.  I refuse to go through the rain and humidity and try to straighten my hair.  So happy with this product.
"
"
I love this spray gel is so convenient and I get the same hold as the other deva gel just les mess
"

After years of blow drying my hair every day into a smooth style, my hair stylist asked me why I didn't want to take advantage of the natural curl and wave in my hair.  I hadn't considered it because I felt that my hair was not really wavy or curly enough.  But I found that wasn't the case after she introduced me to the DevaCurl product line.  These hair care products actually boost natural wave and curl, and I found that I have much curlier hair than I'd previously thought.  So for the past few months, I've been using their shampoo and styling products and have been happy with my new shoulder-length loose tousled curls.But my hair has a tendency to get a bit dry, especially during the summer months, so my stylist recommended DevaCurl's Heaven in Hair Intense Moisture Treatment a few months after switching to my new curly style.It works well, although I don't use it as often (2-3 times a week) as it recommends on the label.  At most, I use it once a week since it's a bit time consuming to do.After washing my hair with their No Poo shampoo, I gently blot dry with a towel and then apply this thick cream throughout my hair and leave it on for about 30 minutes.  For extra conditioning, the instructions recommend putting a plastic cap over your hair, but I haven't found that necessary.  After about 30 minutes, I rinse the Heaven in Hair cream from my hair and then apply whatever styling/volumizing DevaCurl products that I want (I normally use their Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam, Styling Cream, and/or Light Defining Gel).Although this Intense Moisturizing cream feels thick and rich while in my hair, I've found that it rinses out easily without weighing down my curls or leaving any greasy residue.
"
"
Heaven in hair is amazing! First off I have fine, medium perosity curls. My hair needs a lot of moisture (winter is brutal where I live!) and is sensitive to protein.  My curls range in type from 4A (bangs), 3A in the very back and 3B everywhere else.Now the conditioner...I tried using it as a typical conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes and rinsing but it didn't penetrate deep enough and my hair was still dry/frizzy. Now I use it in the shower after I cowash (2-3 times a week depending on how dry it is/weather, etc). The steam/heat of the shower adds additional benefit too. I apply all over and then scrunch until my hair starts sectioning off naturally. Then I finger twist each section to help train my curls. Leave it on for about 15/20 minuteswhile I shave,etc. Then I rinse out most of it, leaving just a little left on my hair. I lightly scrunch with a towel until my hair isn't dripping anymore but is still really wet, then add leave-in mixed with jojoba oil and comb through.Before Heaven in hair, I had to force my hair to curl, prodding,poking and twisting. Since using this, once I comb it through the curls bounce back back and naturally clump on their own. I get gorgeous natural ringlets! I almost wept the first time it happened!After combing to make sure all the product is evenly distributed,  I follow this with scrunching a few times then diffuse and go. Sometimes I'll scrunch in a bit of gel on the ends after the leave-in too. This process leaves my curls shiny, soft and bouncey!!
"
"
DevaCurl Heaven in Hair moisture treatment in one product I try to never run out of!  Once each week I comb out my curls, shampoo my scalp thoroughly, slather my hair with Heaven in Hair Moisture Treatment and cover it with a disposable plastic shower cap.  I leave the product in my hair for 10-30 minutes then rinse out in cool water.  I try to leave a very small amount of the product in my hair for continued moisturizing.  I highly recommend this deep conditioning product for curly hair needs!
"
"
My hair is so incredibly dry nothing has ever kept it from frizzing. No my hair is greying and losing all its remaining luster. My stylist advised me to use this as a leave in condition.  At the end of the shower, while my hair is still drenched with water, I take some and work it from the ends up. For the first time in my life, I simply have the softest, shiniest ringlets. I do have to use vinegar or some other clarifying product every 2 washes to get the build up off, but there isn't another product out there -- and I've tried DOZENS -- that gives the results this does. Pity it's so pricey, but for the results, it's worth it.
"
"
Pros:  genuine diva curl products, pleasant lemongrass soft sand, good slip, moisturizing, Add softness, fairly easy to rinse out, can be used with or without heat, please well with other products,easy to use, simple packaging,  no silicones, parabens, or other bad stuff for the most part.CONS:  takes a lot to do any good. I had to apply it at least twice per application to get any results. That means I washed, conditioned, rinsed, and conditioned again before I got any softness going.  That factor makes it quite expensive, caused  an  allergic build up type issuects,  unsure of the cruelty free status. There does not appear to be any animal products, however Well this is a pretty good mask, it takes quite a bit per use. Though my hair is only shoulderlength, I used this mask with in three weeks at one use a week.  If it worked miracles, I would buy it again, but as it is just a regular mask, I will have to pass. If your hair is in pretty good shape, fine, or porous, this mask might work better for you.Reference: shoulder length long bob, 2c/3a natural curly texture, sensory experience skin, follow the Curly Girl method and organic/cruelty free when possible. dry, low porosity,

This product has artificial coloring and can be left in hair??? I don't get why there are dyes in the ingredient list. I don't care if the cream is slightly blue; I want natural ingredients. Also, this is a ""deep conditioner,"" but the instructions say you can use it as a leave in... Which tells me that it's not a true deep conditioner because otherwise it would instruct me to wash it out after 30 minutes max. Real deep conditioners are formulated to pack a big punch and work quickly and leaving them in can actually weaken the hair if not rinsed out soon after application. It works all right, but not much different from a conditioner. I'm much happier with my SheaMoisture protein mask and BrioGeo Don't Despair Repair mask. Both natural and they work wonders. I've never been a big fan of Deva Curl and I doubt I'll be buying any more of their products. Come on, do you expect curlies to fall for this?
"

This is supposed to be a once a month treatment but for me it’s an every washing conditioner. I was my hair about 2 times a week, just because I’m a head sweater. My hair becomes so wet in heat not a pretty sight. I “wash” the sweat out then condition rinse half way out then condition with the conditioner you are suppose to rinse out, this is my leave in conditioner add gel scrunch to get water out and “plop” it until half dry and air dry
"

I swear by all Deva products. It has allowed me to wear wash & go style with my frizzy curly mess. haha. really though, I have grown my hair out longer than ever before thanks to this great line. It keeps it healthy and strong and I feel better not using the chemicals.

Very moisturizing, very good product and it smells terrific!
"

Love this product! I have tight curls; this adds lots of moisture and softness.

After years of blow drying my hair every day into a smooth style, my hair stylist asked me why I didn't want to take advantage of the natural curl and wave in my hair.  I hadn't considered it because I felt that my hair was not really wavy or curly enough.  But I found that wasn't the case after she introduced me to the DevaCurl product line.  These hair care products actually boost natural wave and curl, and I found that I have much curlier hair than I'd previously thought.  So for the past few months, I've been using their shampoo and styling products and have been happy with my new shoulder-length loose tousled curls.But my hair has a tendency to get a bit dry, especially during the summer months, so my stylist recommended DevaCurl's Heaven in Hair Intense Moisture Treatment a few months after switching to my new curly style.It works well, although I don't use it as often (2-3 times a week) as it recommends on the label.  At most, I use it once a week since it's a bit time consuming to do.After washing my hair with their No Poo shampoo, I gently blot dry with a towel and then apply this thick cream throughout my hair and leave it on for about 30 minutes.  For extra conditioning, the instructions recommend putting a plastic cap over your hair, but I haven't found that necessary.  After about 30 minutes, I rinse the Heaven in Hair cream from my hair and then apply whatever styling/volumizing DevaCurl products that I want (I normally use their Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam, Styling Cream, and/or Light Defining Gel).Although this Intense Moisturizing cream feels thick and rich while in my hair, I've found that it rinses out easily without weighing down my curls or leaving any greasy residue.

Heaven in hair is amazing! First off I have fine, medium perosity curls. My hair needs a lot of moisture (winter is brutal where I live!) and is sensitive to protein.  My curls range in type from 4A (bangs), 3A in the very back and 3B everywhere else.Now the conditioner...I tried using it as a typical conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes and rinsing but it didn't penetrate deep enough and my hair was still dry/frizzy. Now I use it in the shower after I cowash (2-3 times a week depending on how dry it is/weather, etc). The steam/heat of the shower adds additional benefit too. I apply all over and then scrunch until my hair starts sectioning off naturally. Then I finger twist each section to help train my curls. Leave it on for about 15/20 minuteswhile I shave,etc. Then I rinse out most of it, leaving just a little left on my hair. I lightly scrunch with a towel until my hair isn't dripping anymore but is still really wet, then add leave-in mixed with jojoba oil and comb through.Before Heaven in hair, I had to force my hair to curl, prodding,poking and twisting. Since using this, once I comb it through the curls bounce back back and naturally clump on their own. I get gorgeous natural ringlets! I almost wept the first time it happened!After combing to make sure all the product is evenly distributed,  I follow this with scrunching a few times then diffuse and go. Sometimes I'll scrunch in a bit of gel on the ends after the leave-in too. This process leaves my curls shiny, soft and bouncey!!

DevaCurl Heaven in Hair moisture treatment in one product I try to never run out of!  Once each week I comb out my curls, shampoo my scalp thoroughly, slather my hair with Heaven in Hair Moisture Treatment and cover it with a disposable plastic shower cap.  I leave the product in my hair for 10-30 minutes then rinse out in cool water.  I try to leave a very small amount of the product in my hair for continued moisturizing.  I highly recommend this deep conditioning product for curly hair needs!
"
"
My hair is so incredibly dry nothing has ever kept it from frizzing. No my hair is greying and losing all its remaining luster. My stylist advised me to use this as a leave in condition.  At the end of the shower, while my hair is still drenched with water, I take some and work it from the ends up. For the first time in my life, I simply have the softest, shiniest ringlets. I do have to use vinegar or some other clarifying product every 2 washes to get the build up off, but there isn't another product out there -- and I've tried DOZENS -- that gives the results this does. Pity it's so pricey, but for the results, it's worth it.

Pros:  genuine diva curl products, pleasant lemongrass soft sand, good slip, moisturizing, Add softness, fairly easy to rinse out, can be used with or without heat, please well with other products,easy to use, simple packaging,  no silicones, parabens, or other bad stuff for the most part.CONS:  takes a lot to do any good. I had to apply it at least twice per application to get any results. That means I washed, conditioned, rinsed, and conditioned again before I got any softness going.  That factor makes it quite expensive, caused  an  allergic build up type issuects,  unsure of the cruelty free status. There does not appear to be any animal products, however Well this is a pretty good mask, it takes quite a bit per use. Though my hair is only shoulderlength, I used this mask with in three weeks at one use a week.  If it worked miracles, I would buy it again, but as it is just a regular mask, I will have to pass. If your hair is in pretty good shape, fine, or porous, this mask might work better for you.Reference: shoulder length long bob, 2c/3a natural curly texture, sensory experience skin, follow the Curly Girl method and organic/cruelty free when possible. dry, low porosity,

This product has artificial coloring and can be left in hair??? I don't get why there are dyes in the ingredient list. I don't care if the cream is slightly blue; I want natural ingredients. Also, this is a ""deep conditioner,"" but the instructions say you can use it as a leave in... Which tells me that it's not a true deep conditioner because otherwise it would instruct me to wash it out after 30 minutes max. Real deep conditioners are formulated to pack a big punch and work quickly and leaving them in can actually weaken the hair if not rinsed out soon after application. It works all right, but not much different from a conditioner. I'm much happier with my SheaMoisture protein mask and BrioGeo Don't Despair Repair mask. Both natural and they work wonders. I've never been a big fan of Deva Curl and I doubt I'll be buying any more of their products. Come on, do you expect curlies to fall for this?

Very moisturizing, very good product and it smells terrific!
"

Love this product! I have tight curls; this adds lots of moisture and softness.
"
"
It has an amazing smell and it leaves my hair feeling like silk after using it. I wish it would come in a bigger size. I sometimes use a little bit as a leave in conditioner.  I wish Amazon would tape the lids shut so no product would be waste.
"
"
I live and die by this product for deep condition or leave in. It literally transforms my hair/curls. utilizing it while simultaneously putting water with my curls keeps them soft, defined and it does not get crusty or hard once my hair dries. The only thing is I use it for deep condition every week or so. I try to sperad usage so my hair doesnt get dependant and over saturated with using it.
"
"
This arrived without the DevaCurl box, the label was applied sloppily, and the contents were coming out of the top (seems it was put in sloppily).  This is not typical of DevaCurl products I have purchased in the stores.
"
"
I think it costs too much BUT it is a great product
"
"
I would not recommend at all does nothing for my hair & it's  VERY EXPENSIVE! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!
"
"
I have really long, thick, coarse, wavy hair and nothing seems to condition enough to tame the frizz. I've been using this twice a week for about a month now and my hair is softer and smoother than ever. I can't say I've seen continued improvement over time so I'm giving four stars, but as a quick initial improvement, I'm happy with it.
"
"
not the same consistency as if you buy it in a salon
"
"
I wasn't really sure if I would need this but I have to say that I cannot live without it.  I wash and condition my hair, rinse with cold water and apply this in the shower before I get out.  I towel my hair dry, or at least so it isn't dripping et and apply some of the Deva Curl gel and I am good to go.  It makes my hair look and feel amazing.  I can't live without it.  This is also the best price option that I could find.
"
"
GREAT Product! My daughter has extremely curly hair and a TON of it. This is thick and gets the tangles out with minimal crying.
"
"
It hydrates and has a nice smell. I usually leave it for like 15 minutes and it does the job. However, I believe it's better to use a diffuser in combination with the other Deva Curl products to have great curls.
"
"
It makes your hair feels smooth and with shine (using extra products of course) but is so flimsy you'll need a lot of product to make that happen so you'll use it 3 times tops.
"
"
My fault, I didn't read the directions before ordering. This is NOT a leave-in, but am still very happy with it. makes my hair feel like silk!
"
"
 This comb is revolutionary. At the first pass through my unruly, wispy blonde hair, I was hooked. My life is changed. The hand feel of this bad boy will make knees weak. The weight of the wood in my hand made vision blurry. Knots? By bitch.
"
"
I call this my miracle worker. Leaves my hair nice and soft and smelling oh so good!
"
"
I feel like my hair is so much softer and manageable now, I use this once a week and it has made a difference to the texture of my hair. This also smells very nice.
"
"
Es buen producto, Pero creo que como máscara debió ser más espesa.. lo sentí más cómo acondicionador... pensé que los resultados serían más notorios.Hasta ahora no encuentro la máscara ideal
"
"
if you have naturally curly hair and haven't gone to the Devacurl way your are not getting the best out of your hair. I used to use mousse and gel etc... from the stores and get my hair cut like every other person in the world does wet, pulled down and  trimmed. WRONG oh so Wrong!! I know only get my hair cut by a trained Deva Curl professional and never use anything in my hair but Deva products. The Heaven in hair is perfect for my hair. Along with the low poo shampoo. I love, love my curls now... no frizz no tangled ratted mess. Just amazing soft curls!!!
"
"
I love this treatment. It detangles my hair well and leaves it super soft after it's rinsed out. I have 3c hair type for reference.
"
"
Excellent stuff!! Detangles my hair naturally on it's own.
"
"
I use this for deep conditioning but prefer some of the other Deva products for daily use
"
"
Very expensive
"
"
Love this product. Does wonders for shine & moisture!
"
"
I love this product! Has great slip and the smell its not too strong or stays on the hair! Really good for deep conditioning!!!
"
"
This is my first amazon review. There is a lot of talk right now about DevaCurl products causing major hair loss and hair damage. Please do your research about DevaCurl and look into the #recalldevacurl movement before buying. Thank you amazon for giving me a full refund for this product.
"
"
Smells so good. Really brings my hair back from the dead.
"
"
Favorite deep conditioning product! I put It on and then twist my hair and put it in a shower cap and I totally love the results. My hair smells great and it hydrates my hair!
"
"
I don't feel any big difference o change
"
"
Great hair product and the smell is so wonderful! Make my hair feel super soft!
"
"
Heaven for my hair. The scent is amazing. Love all their products !
"
"
Works really well for a deep conditioner.
"
"
Yes
"
"
I love this treatment so much!! It smells amazing. It works like a charm too. My curls are so much more defined, nourished and they are soooooooo shiny! Love it and strongly recommend!
"
"
My thick, African hair responds well to this product. I have defined curls instead of frizz. It is worth the money.
"
"
Nice rich conditioner that leaves my hair extremely moisturized!
"
"
After having my hair styled with this at the salon, I bought the large jar and finished it way too quickly. I LOVE this stuff. My one caveat would have to be the price. I tried to go without it, and even attempted to find substitute products, but nothing works as well. It's worth every penny.
"
"
Love this product. Great pick-me-up for my hair when it needs that extra hydration.
"
"
Helps the curly haired folks!
"
"
Please don’t buy this product -didn’t moisturised the hair but damaged the hair.My hair was dry and after I used a month the product now my hair is super dry 😟.
"
"
Love my curls
"
"
Love this stuff. Helpful hint: Use it as a leave-in conditioner for unbelievably great curls.
"
"
Daughter loves the product.
"
"
I am hooked on this deep conditioner. It keeps my curls soft, easy to detangle dense hair and I have less shedding. Hence,healthier hair!!!
"
"
Excellent product. Works great.
"
"
Been using this product as my go to for years.  One of the best curly girl brands on the market.  Arrived on time and in good condition. Excellent price.
"
"
Now I don't use anything on my curls and they are healthier
"
"
These are the worst products ever!!  My hair has gotten thinner since I started using them!
"
"
it is heaven in hair, but do not over use as hair will dry up and start breaking.
"
"
Leaves my hair super soft.
"
"
My curls love this stuff!
"
"
Great stuff for curly heads! Curl defining and frizz reducing.
"
"
Me gusta mucho y me gusta el olor.
"
"
Did not do any difference than cheaper products.
"
"
For reference, I have type 3b curly hair and have been on my curly cycle for over 2 years. I used the product twice a week after clarifying my hair for 3 months.This product worked well when I first started using it, making my curls feel super soft and manageable. However, after about a month and a half it started irritating my scalp, making it itchy and uncomfortable to sleep on even if I had just clarified, air dried, braided, and slept on a silk pillow. Build up started to accumulate at roots, which was strange considering I only applied to the ends of my hair and I hadn't changed anything in my routine aside from adding this deep conditioner. Tried to tailor my routine around it with no luck, even reducing its usage to once every week/everything other week. Was sad it didn't work out long term, I was so happy initially ):
"
"
Great
"
"
Moisturizers my hair really well!
"
"
Fantastic conditioner for naturally curly hair.  Thick without being heavy on the hair.  I use it daily, not just as a deep conditioner.  Can't live without it.
"
"
Super moisturizer!
"
"
Totally moisturizing ♡
"
"
Love it, it makes my hair so soft!
"
"
Works wonders
"
"
It ok, not great
"
"
Love it
"
"
Great product
"
"
Love this moisture treatment, by DevaCurl!!! It's not easy for me to find good products to use on my naturally curly hair, so I was very happy to find this moisturizer, which is so good to my hair. Definitely worth trying!!!!
"
"
DecaCurl is my go to hair care product line but I haven’t really seen a difference in hair moisture while using this. I’ve used this conditioner at leasg 5 times now and nothing noticible has changed in the softness or moisture of my hair. It smells interesting, not horrible, sort of chemical like. I like the consistency of it though.
"
"
Wasn't expecting it to arrive so early seeing as I didn't pay for faster shipping. But it did. Ordered it Friday Oct. 21st, and here it is Monday. I already used this product  many times before, however, always had the small jar, so when I saw the 16 once and two at that at such a price, I had to get it.If you were wondering if this deep conditioner is worth it, yes. My Curls love it so very much, and I'm talking type 3a,3b, 3c, and when it comes to my cousin that has type 4a, and 4b hair, the same thing. Her hair sucks it up.For me having low porosity hair, it takes a lot to get in moister, and this, my god it's everything. DevaCurl and their products are everything. These are my staple products for sure. The Price is worth it to me, but I can't speak for anyone else but me. At the end you have to chose for yourself.
"
"
This didn't make any difference in my hair.  I won't purchase it again.
"
"
This product is great.  Super easy to use. I wanted something to enhance my hair that was not complicated and took a long time. This is very A to B.  I noticed a change the first time I used it.
"
"
This is literally heaven in hair, I recommended this to all of my natural and transitioning friends. I have 3C/4A hair and it immediate moisturizes my hair while applying it. I usually deep condition overnight but I wouldn’t recommend doing that with this product because the hair might become over moistured. All around a great product that has become a staple in my routine.
"
"
Even Deva Curl couldn’t mess up a conditioner. My less expensive brand gives me the same results.
"
"
This stuff sucks, don’t waste your money, I love deva curl products but this one sucks!!!
"
"
The first time I was introduced to this was when I got my Devacut. When they applied it, I thought ""wow, they're pretty stingy"". I assumed my fantastic results were solely a product of the styling cream. It's been years and I've spent god knows how much on all these different products... now I humbly return to devacurl. I used a quarter size of HIC DC for each half of my head. This product really helps with definition.  I can see the immediate difference as soon as I get out of the shower.
"
"
perfect!
"
"
Love it
"
"
doesn't really seem to add moisture at all, just the opposite.  I end up with more tangles when I use it than when I use something else.  My hair is not wavy but not really curly either, so I cant have it getting all tangled when I am trying to wash and condition it.  I do love the tingle that you get from the mint in it, that feels awesome, just wished it actually added the moisture it claims.  I use other DevaCurl products and I love them, so I was disappointed this didn't live up to the title.
"
"
Made my hair dry and straw like. Super disappointing when I love other products from DevaCurl
"
"
Love this stuff!
"
"
Although we LOVE this product, it came to us OPENED! The lid was opened and no plastic cover piece on top. The product was all over the bottle and inside of the delivery bag. Not sure if I even want to use it now, not knowing what may have been put inside
"
"
Please note: The actual product might be FABULOUS, but what I received was not!I asked for this for Christmas and got it! I was incredibly excited. I followed all the instructions very carefully but both times that I used it my hair just felt AWFUL afterwards. It felt dry, knotted, squeaky. Just horrid. Both times I caved and applied my regular Deva conditioner on my hair afterwards just to get some relief! It didn't make any sense to me at all that their regular conditioner was better than this super-awesome deep conditioner.I contacted DevaCurl and learned that Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer of their products!!!! It's extremely likely that what I got was counterfeit, and anyone else who orders here may get the same.Think about it. This size sells for $44 on their website, but it's here for $26? Seems a bit fishy.I'm now going to order ONLY from the DevaCurl website. All of the products I've gotten there have been absolutely amazing and fantastic for my hair!
"
"
For me it’s just ok. I haven’t found a great leave in yet. I also hate the smell of devacurl products....
"
"
So I actually bought this product from an Ulta and loved it! I only swear by two deep conditioners this one and TGIN Honey mask deep conditioner. So when I was moving I decided to order it on Amazon through Prime so I would not miss out on my deep conditioner.... Plus I was getting 16 oz for the price of the 12 oz so why not right? So when I received the product I smelled it. It smelled like the heaven in hair but way lighter...  I decided to use it anyway because I already bought it and did not have time to go to the store. The product works... it just takes a minute to get into the hair. My hair was extremely soft just like the one I bought from Ulta. A week later I decided to go to my local store and buy another one 12 oz for the price above. I opened the bottle and compare it to this one, and realized This product is the water down version. It still works, but I can tell the smell is not the same as the original bottle. Now I read the negative reviews (which everyone should) and realized that most people rarely read 1 star so I decided to put a 5 star because the actual product works on 3b/3c/4a/4b hair. so I think the product is amazing even if its watered down in this case. Like I mentioned earlier I only order it from Amazon because I wanted the prime status. In the future, I will just order from naturallycurly.com or Devacurl.com. Moisturizing Natural hair is already a hard enough process already without someone taking advantage of the products we use.

Miracle Conditioner.  I just got it today and used it.  My curls are super soft.  Love it.  My hair was so dry the curls were not forming. Just one use and look at the picture.  And they are so soft.
"
"
This is NOT the product that I've been buying from Deva for many years. Your product is green and thicker with a stronger smell. The deva heaven in hair product is pearl colored and a little bit runny. You put false product into my order.  I am able to compare the product because I have a previous jar of heaven in hair and I put two teaspoons next to each other. it was obvious that one was green and one was pearl and one had a different texture and one was much stronger smelling. I hope the people that see this review know that they should never buy from you. I'll be returning this product ASAP. Forthwith I will never buy from a supplier again that is not Deva.I will put in a picture of the two products side by side later on.
"
"
I read the reviews before buying this and thought I’d try it since they seemed mixed. That was a huge mistake. I use other DevaCurl products and didn’t have a problem with them so I’m not sure if this was fake or not. It did NOT feel like I was putting any kind of conditioner in my hair. It made my hair extremely tangled and felt like I was trying to comb out the knots with shampoo. The more I put, the worse it got and I ended up using a ton of normal conditioner to try to fix the tangled disgusting mess my hair had become. It was so bad I didn’t even want to try ordering it from the DevaCurl site to see if it was fake. I ended up returning it and ordered a different brand of deep conditioner. I’m not sure if the problem is a sketchy vendor or DevaCurl’s product, but if you really want to try this, I would order another deep conditioner as a backup.
"
"
I love this stuff. I use it as a leave-in in the winter when my hair turns to straw with the dryness of the heat being on all the time. I also mix it with heaven in hair once a month for an overnight conditioning and the combo is great for my hair. I use Deva products every day and my curls have changed over time to healthy and bouncy.
"
"
This came with fingerprint smears and a long black hair wrapped in the thread/product. I didn't get a chance to try it.
"
"
My favorite DevaCurl conditioning treatment. It’s expensive. I use it every couple of days and leave a little in upon rinsing. Also, I put a little in a spray bottle with water to spritz for added moisture during the day. Very neutral fragrance.If I could only have one DevaCurl product this might be it.
"
"
You pay for what you get. I understand that. But I can’t afford deva curl. I tried this product for my daughter and really don’t see any difference with it. Maybe you need the whole line.
"
"
This is my favorite Deva product. I keep it in the shower and use it after shampooing. It has a nice smell but importantly, works well on my FINE, curly hair.
"
"
This product is not what the name reveals.I could not comb through my hair with this product on my hair in the shower - it made more knots than it took out.  Usually with any conditioner your hair feels soft & smooth while the conditioner is in your hair & afterwards - not with this one. I had to use different product to get the knots out of my hair after using this deep conditioner. I am throwing it away.
"
"
Love DevaCurl as my curly hair is very dry! I use this once a week, leave it on about 2 hours while I'm doing housework, then rinse it out! If you have naturally curly hair, this is a must buy! Will buy again.
"
"
I like to mix a couple of deep conditioners together and try to switch which ones I use every time, but I literally always include a dollop of this. I love it. Perfect name for this stuff. Not even a big fan of deva curl (or more specifically their prices) but I won't go without this.
"
"
It's okay but I didn't like it that much because I don't feel the hair soft after using it.  I always have to complement it with another smoother conditioner.  I would not buy it again...
"
"
It smells horrible. Smells like Method bathroom cleaner. I will have to continue to us it because it was expensive.
"
"
Dried out my hair. Usually love all things Deva - but not this! Worked well in salon but not at home.
"
"
I dont know what all the hipe is about. This did nothing for me
"
"
I am sure the product has good ingredients it is just that it does nothing for my particular hair, I found it stiff and heavy for my hair.
"
"
Totally LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I use it once every two weeks.....
"
"
Absolutely love this product! And the smell is fantastic! It leaves my hair feeling soft for days until my next treatment.
"
"
Drenches my curls with mousture and takes out frizz . My curls are non frizzy for days after use .
"
"
Best deep conditioner I've ever used.  As soon as I poor it on wet hair it immediately melts into my hair removing tangles and softening it up.
"
"
I didn't particularly like this product.  I have used it multiple times on my daughters, and each time, I don't feel like their hair feels better.  It doesn't seem to provide the type of moisture it states.
"
"
I really like this product and I buy it over and over again.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Love love love deva curl is the best ...I make a leave in with this ...omg the best leave in ever I will always purchase this!!!!
"
"
I really like the hydration this product provided.  It did exactly what it promised for my dry curls.
"
"
love this hair product
"
"
my hair loves this product.
"
"
Don’t waste your money, I’ve given this product many chances and it hasn’t shown anything dramatically different than Aussie deeep conditioner and that one is $4!!! I actually prefer the Aussie deep conditioner over this one. Soooo disappointed.
"
"
God
"
"
Not as intensely moisturizing as I hoped.
"
"
Love my curls
"
"
This product is heavenly and works great!
"
"
It made my hair feel stiff and weird.I thought maybe if I kept using it this would change, but it did not change.I would not recommend this product.I've tried other DevaCurl products, like the clear gel, the set it spray, the no poo shampoo, the shampoo that has a little poo, the styling cream and the regular conditioner and they've worked well in my curly hair.
"
"
The shipping and price was great.  I think there are deep conditioners out there that are better, and more reasonably priced.  I liked it, but won't get it if it's not on a great sale
"
"
Nope, nope, nope.  Did NOT get good results form this product AT ALL...  I am a mixed race (Filipino/Black) 'natural' with more ethnic 3c/4a, LOW POROSITY hair.  I bought this based on the YouTube videos I saw of other naturals who really loved this product.  I should also admit that I did read the reviews from some low porosity naturals who complained about the amount of PROTEIN in this product being too high for low-pos like me.  So I was a little hesitant but wanted to give it a try anyway.  I started out with my usual co-washing and conditioning, then followed up with an ACV rinse to make sure I had a 'clean slate' to work with.  I added the DevaCurl Heaven in Hair, covered with a plastic cap and the added my thermal heat cap for 20 minutes as recommended.  Rinsed thoroughly and, OMG...  I could NOT believe my eyes.  All my coils were gone from my hair - ALL OF THEM!  Not one single coil and my hair looked and felt like a GIANT, BLACK COTTON BALL.  It was dry and frizzy and did NOT lay down no matter what I did.  I wash in SHOCK!!!  I could NOT believe how awful my hair turned out.Needless to say, I spent the next few hours BACK in the shower re-washing and re-conditioning and I used my old deep conditioner to get the moisture and coils back in my hair.  Unfortunately I will be returning this product but I want all the low-po's out there to know that this is NOT the product for us.  I'm

"
no heaven here... made my hair dry
"

The first time I purchased this I purchased the 8 oz. container.  Now I'm purchasing the 16 oz. container.  Save your money and purchase the larger container because trust me you will wish you would have the first time.  It really moisturizes.  I use other DevaCurl products and every once in awhile I use this and sit underneath the dryer.  I have thick wavy/curly hair that is low porosity so that is why I have to sit underneath a hair dryer for about 10+ minutes so it will get into my strands.  I loooove this product.  It smells so good.  I can't really put my finger on it, but the smell reminds me of when I was a little girl and my Mother.  You really don't need to use a lot.  I was advised by DevaCurl to use this product and I'm so happy I did.  You can't and won't go wrong with using this.  Amazon has a great price for this size product.

Maybe this works for healthy hair, but it does nothing for damaged hair - which is mostly why you would want a deep conditioner in the first place.  I finally got tired of living with the dry, crispy, unmanageable hair that results from repeated coloring, and I'm letting my gray hair grow out.  My hair is now healthier than it's been in a long time and it's nice to see my natural curls again, but no matter how I use this, whether as a deep conditioner or as a leave-in, it helps only slightly with curl definition and hydration.  Does nothing to control frizz.  I get much better results with Living Proof leave-in conditioner, and that requires a much smaller amount of product than this does.

If you have fine curly hair like I do please please try this product. It made my curls come alive. Did not make my scalp itch and didn't weight my curls down.  After three days it held my curls perfect. Love It !!!
"
"
I use this @ least once a week. I love this product. I have been using no poo shampoo and conditioner for about 2 years. Within a few days my hair was extremely dry. I found this product here and decided to use it. I see a drastic difference in my hair. It stays moisturized for a week. My curls are popping now.
"
"
My curls are returning! After damaging and straightening my hair I thought I had lost my curls forever. Strangers are now complimenting my hair again ❤️ I will continue to use Deva Curl products. Can’t wait to see what my hair looks like in 3 months. 😊

My hair responds beautifully when I use the Heaven In Hair.  Big difference in curl pattern and softness when I skip this process.  Highly recommend using this product as specified for gorgeous hair results.  Smells heavenly, too!

I recently learned from my hair stylist that Amazon sellers are not certified to be selling salon products. After learning this, I realized that the product I purchased must have been a fake! It smelled a bit different and I have been struggling with white flakes in my 3b hair, but mainly on my scalp for a while. I was itchy and my scalp was dry. I thought for the longest time that something was wrong with my scalp, but it was the product. I have been purchasing from Amazon for a while and never thought about the validity of what I was buying. Since I purchased the same shampoo from the salon I go to (who is certified), my scalp has significantly improved. Much, much less flakes and itching! (I do live in a dry, hot climate, so some itching from sweating isn't abnormal). Though it is more expensive than what you can get from Amazon, at least you will know that what you are getting is real! Please save yourself the time and money and just purchase the real thing from an actual salon! Your curls and scalp will thank you!

It smells different, and it makes your hair feel different. My hair was listless and dry on the ends after using this. When ordering new products from the DevaCurl website and after one use my hair was back to life. Don't waste your time or money on this product. Pay a little extra to get the real deal. This product is misleading because it comes in what I can only imagine are old DevaCurl bottles, rinsed out and refilled with whatever sludge this was. I rarely write reviews, but I was compelled to write this one to warn everyone.
"
"
I'm not 100% sure that this is the actual product. It looks and smells the same, but I don't get the same results. I would hate to believe that it's not, but it's hard to ignore the facts. I even had some of this product left from an Ulta purchase and the results were what I get when I've used the products in the past. I just don't know, so I will probably not buy it from this vendor again.
"

So, I thought the first time I used it, it did not perform as advertised with my curls (I have Wavy/Medium Curls) and I thought it was because I had just left coconut oil in my hair for about 3 days.  But when I used it the second time, it did the same thing, which many of you are saying; it left my hair looking very dry and frizz all over.  It almost looks like over processed burnt hair.  Normally my curls are very shinny and bouncy.  I don't know about the reviewer that said, she watch a video on how to use; this is not rocket science is Shampoo or No Poo and Condish, she also recommended buying a cream to compliment, wait... I already spent $50 and now I have to buy a cream to make it do what it is supposed to do??? Nah! It does not really smell like anything and I do think like others, I got a used set.Update 4/18/18 - My apologies; there is a science to using this shampoo and conditioner.  First your hair has to get used to it, or get rid of all other build up before it works.  You must apply, and scrunch as it is on, then do the same with the conditioner, finger brushing the hair with head upside down, then rinse with coldest water you can stand.  Never rinse curly hair with Warm or hot water unless you like the Puff Frizz head look. :)- I think it is still too heavy for my hair type and it leaves it a bit weigh down.  I rinse and rinse but still not as bouncy as I would like.  It does leave my hair very soft and moisturize. It may be best for really curly hair, not wavy/curly like mine.  I have gotten better results with the Redkken No Frizz set, I also buy it here on Amazon!

This line has literally saved my curls in every way! I have the thickest, and most course hair in the world! And before I found DevaCurl O was struggling to find the right shampoo and conditioners for my type of hair and scalp. Most of the time the shampoo would be too heavy and cause loads of build-up on my scalp. I love to air dry my hair and I was never ever able to do that because it would be super dry, frizzy, and poof out so bad it looked horrendous! Deva Curl has changed ALL of that for me! After a week of using DevaCurl Decadance I could see the transformation, my hair was shiney and way more manageable. I could air dry it and scrunch and my hair looked amazing and my curls have never looked so great in all my life! I wish I had found this years ago but Im so glad I have it now! And there is no way I will ever go back to regular shampoo and conditioner ever again!! This gives my hair the hydration it craves as well. The smell is so delicious! I can't stop smelling it, LOL! hands down the best products ever! If your thinking about trying this line, DO IT!!! Guarantee you will love them!! They may just change your hair forever,,like they did for me.
"
"
I love this stuff! I've been using Deva Curl for almost 2 years now and I have not loved a shampoo as much as I love this one. If you're thinking of trying out Deva Curl, or if you haven't used Decadence yet, give it a try. This stuff is heaven! I've heard stories about people getting watered down bottles (and this actually happened to me with conditioner once - different seller) but I am completely pleased with this purchase. If the price is scaring you off, one of the large bottles lasts me over 6 months because I only need to use it once or twice a week. I have very thick and long hair that is, or rather was, very prone to getting greasy. Now that I'm using this product line it takes days for my hair to start looking and feeling like it needs a wash, After a few weeks of using Deva Curl I can honestly say that my hair has never been happier!
"
"
I won't, I CAN'T use anything else! I used to switch back and forth between different products. I must have had a small fortune worth of half used products stashed underneath my sink. I am faithful to my Deva No Poo and Deva One Conditioner routine now. My hair is super soft and manageable now. My hair feels clean and healthy now. Something I could never say for drugstore products. I recommend this to everyone I can. Give it a chance, you won't regret it. Do you research and stick with it a good 30 days before you give up. It takes your hair a little while for your hair to get used to this way of cleansing without the harmful chemicals :)
"
"
I am just amazed how well this shampoo/conditioner works. The no-suds shampoo leaves my hair so clean and the conditioner does its job. My curls have never looked so good. Plus, my hair looked great the next day! And, after working out, my hair still looked good.
"
"
I received my product today and it was open and leaked all over the shipping bag. DevaCurl is a absolute 10 but #1topdeals, #donttrust.
"
"
This far the best cleanser for hair.  I've tried them all, and wanted to find a good moisturizing product that won't fade my color.  This is it!!! Look no further, my hair is in better health now then  its ever been.  I'm 50 and my hair looks like it was when I was a teenager.  Who wouldn't want that.  It shines, its soft, and in great health.  Highly recommend buying this one, and from amazon.  The best price around..

This is not a DevaCurl product. It smells completely different and was watered down. I've used DevaCurl for years and this purchase made my hair brittle and dry. Will not be buying again. Be careful purchasing off Amazon.
"

I have wavy/curly hair (s curls) and, before someone recommended DevaCurl products to me, I was always struggling with either curl flattening or big-time fluffball effect. Or frizz. Nothing seemed to leave my hair looking decent. I started with Low-Poo and immediately began to see a difference in the way my hair felt bouncier, yet not fluffy and flyaway. With continued use (and I've been switching between Low-poo and no-poo, with my preference being No-Poo with One Condition Decadence line conditioner and shampoo) my hair is healthier than it's ever been and I don't have to struggle with combing out tangles in the shower. It's really an amazing difference. If you're just switching over to no-sulphate products, give yourself a chance to get used to the feel of them. You'll think that they're not really working, or that they're not washing out, but just trust. You will see the amazing difference if your hair is like mine and everything else leaves it either dry and frizzy or too soft and flyaway (and with the curls flattening within half an hour of being outside).
"
"
I can understand the appeal of these products and know they work for so many but I’ve tried this line and the original and both made my hair so dry and frizzy!! The frizz I couldn’t handle. The survey on the devacurl site said to try this line as shrinkage is a problem for me. Since my hair is fine I questioned it but trusted the site and should’ve tried the lighter line maybe. I believe my hair likes a little silicone even if it isn’t the best for moisture retention. I just don’t think I’m a devacurl gurl! I am trying the IGK products now and am liking those a lot better!
"
"
So far, this is my favorite cowash ever. When I use regular conditioners to co-wash, my scalp never really seems to get clean, but not with this. It is a dedicated co-wash and not a conditioner used to wash hair (I believe there's a difference). I think it's because it contains cocamidopropyl betaine as an ingredient, which is a cleansing agent. So, it's like a lovely conditioner-shampoo hybrid without the drying effects of shampoo and sulfates.I don't usually like to spend a lot of money on something I'll quickly wash down the drain, but this is worth it to me. It starts my hair off on the right foot, which means I can be pretty sure my final styling results will be good. (If my hair wash is drying, it's almost certain that my final style is going to be frizz city).I'm a coarse-haired curly girl and it works great for me. The protein in it doesn't bother my hair, that I can tell. The scent is light, which I appreciate. And I bought it in 32oz because my hair is so thick, it eats 8oz products as appetizers.
"
"
This product is horrible! It left my hair dry and brittle! I was supposed to receive one bottle of NoPoo and one of Conditioner, I received two conditioners so thought I'd try it. Horrible results. This is the first product I've ever returned other than if something was broken.
"
"
FINALLY a product that works on my hair that isn't outlandishly priced.I have Moana type of hair; thick, some curls tighter than others, and almost as long, and just A LOT of it.  I only have to use 3-5 pumps each showering so these bottles will last for quite some time.  If you have hair like mine, I recommend not washing the conditioner out of your roots since it will go a long way in assisting the dry, frizz that seems to never be tameable in that area when using after-shower products.  If you leave the conditioner in your hair for 10 minutes before rinsing, you will see and feel a MASSIVE difference in the health of your hair. These have a fresh, subtle scent as well.
"
"
I'm very upset, I had to update my review. These aren't authentic I only use devacurl and it make my hair soft and takes away my frizz. I've used this product twice, it dries my hair out and leaves it naughty. The texture of how it leaves my hair is like i just dyed it too many times, that damaged feeling. I just want to return them but I opened them already 😢
"
"
Well I love devacurl. But I'm going back to my old product. My stylist recommended this one and the first one I bought was really good and this time my hair is much drier and feels strung out. My ends are at their frizziest. I just wish there was some kind of recourse since I'm now out 60 dollars for a fake product.
"
"
I love this product and I was extremely excited to use it on my curly hair for the first time but the bottles both arrived damaged. A quarter of the liquid was all over the bottles! I was disappointed, especially since I paid good money for these!
"
"
I tried a sample of the DevaCurl cleanse and I fell in love with what it did for my hair. This was a legitimate product and I am very happy with the purchase. The only issue I had was that the conditioner in mine leaked a little bit as I’ve read in other reviews. It wasn’t a lot but I felt the packaging from Amazon could definitely be better.
"
"
The only thing better for my families curls is ... Nothing. I have been using Devacurl products for years and was happy to see this new item. If you are a one condition and no poo user who still needs moisture, they made this product for you. (And me).I also use this for my kids. Ages 4 and 6.
"
"
I’ve gotten the Deva Curl One Codition Original, and I loved it, my hair loved it, it was incredible. And when I saw the Decadance on here for cheaper I thought I’d try it. Immediately when I opened it I thought it kinda smelled like a cheap conditioner, but I thought maybe that’s how it was supposed to be. There was also no difference in the cleanser and the deap conditioner. They smelled the same, felt the same, and I’m sure are the same. I’ve been using it for about a month and a half, and my hair has lost its curl, just waves, and is frizzing pretty bad. I used the little bit left I could scrape out of my old bottle and my hair is happy and is curling again. If you do end up buying, just beware of fakes so you don’t have to be a sad customer who spent almost $70 on what’s probably Pantene :(
"
"
I did not get the right product as pictured, when I purchased as you can see there is an aqua cap advertised but I received the lime green cap.. unfortunately the product inside is different. I have ordered this product straight from DevaCurl and the green cap and aqua cap bottle is a totally different product even though it reads the same.. I am not sure if the aqua cap is a new formula but that’s the one I wanted. When I received the product I thought oh maybe it’s just old packaging, but upon using it I realized the formula is different. How can this be resolved?
"
"
Love it !!!! I never heard there I different types of shampoos by mild level and this no pop is perfect . I don’t miss the fact that it doesn’t lather even though it says to use a good amount I use the size of a quarter (I have this short hair ) and it perfect . You don’t feel a lather but it feels like you are using a very moisturizing conditioner .
"
"
Great new summery smell -- only buy if you like the smell of coconut! I have been a DevaCurl devotee for years now, and I found this new formula to be really enjoyable -- very nourishing with a great, lasting smell. Has the same de-tangling properties as the other formula. Nice thick texture -- feels great on my locks. Love it!
"
"
I stayed out with the original no-poo and conditioner Fromm DevaCurl and Inloved it! I went to Sephora and saw this new decadence line and wanted to try it since my hair is dry and the woman helping said it would probably be better for me since my hair is prone to dryness. I LOVE what this Duo does for my hair. I have 3b-4a curls and this does a great job with allowing my hair to have slip when detangling in the shower, and for my hair to clump after getting out. On top of mositerizing my curls, the shampoo leaves a refreshing feeling in my scalp and both products are very light which is plus! I’m very satisfied with this combo! I would give this product 5 stars and I recommend it to all of my dry, textured hair persons!
"
"
Last year I began on the Devacurl kick! I got the devacut and was gifted a bunch of leave in and no poo. I did like how my hair felt and smoothed during wash day...but there were things I was over looking and thinking it was me. I have had a terribly itchy scalp despite frequent black castor oil scalp applications..I figured it was something else I was using. My edges began looking thin and I again assumed it was my edge control. No. I came across the many youtube videos describing others experiences and the companies lack of explanation or help. I WENT HOME AND THREW OUT MY NO POO IMMEDIATELY! I hopped in the shower, used a clarifying shampoo, my old conditioner (that I was told was too heavy for my hair at the devacurl hair salon) and my scalp magically is feeling much better.....a few itches here and there but not constant. No improvement on my edges yet, I am working on changing my entire wash day routine. DONT DO IT!
"
"
My daughter ordered this cleanser first and recommended that I try it. Although we both have long hair, mine is thicker and drier. I only have to wash it about every three days. She washes hers daily. I was mighty skeptical at first- it felt like trying to wash my hair with straight up conditioner. It was strange not to lather up and I fully expected my hair to not look, feel or smell clean. But I applied a generous amount, scrubbed my scalp vigorously and worked it though my hair for about 3 minutes. I then let it sit several minutes while I showered. SURPRISE!!! My hair looks, feels and smells clean, and is much better behaved than when I used traditional shampoo. LOVE IT!!!
"
"
I have waist length 3c Curls and just recently had my hair highlighted with bleach and some color.  This left my hair parched for moisture, but using this system every other day, with a co-wash and occasional conditioner leave in, my hair is soft, shiny and manageable!!! I have had the shampoo and conditioner for almost 2 months and I still have about 1/3 of the bottle left!!!If you don't have dry or color treated hair, this product should be used in moderation.  Once a week for hydration purposes at most.Must Have!!
"
"
Edit:  I recently ordered again and instead of receiving ‘Decadence’ I received ‘Original.’I love this product but when I last ordered, instead of getting a bottle of No-Poo and a bottle of One Condition, I received 2 bottles of One Condition.
"
"
I've been using Deva Curl for about 4 years and I cannot thank my friends enough for recommending me this product! I used to straighten my hair every single day because I couldn't deal with my kinky hair and now I hate my hair straight, my curls are so healthy and lushes again!4 stars-  because the bottle came open and unfortunately a huge chunk fell out BUT can't complain this price is unbeatable! Will  definitely  be purchasing again!!
"
"
These products are not that moisturizing.  I know so many people who swear by them, but they don’t work that well for me.  When using the line after 2 days my hair is so dry it’s ridiculous.  I have to add some more leave in conditioner to my hair.  This stuff is too pricey to not really work.  Never purchasing again.
"
"
This conditioner was terrible.  My hair was frizzy and dry when I used it, it looked awful.  I finally read the ingredients list and saw silicone.  If you’ve ever ready the Curly Girl Handbook, where the Deva products began, it says to avoid silicone if you have curly hair.  Silicone makes curly hair dry and dead.  I was so disappointed in this Decadence conditioner because I thought it would replace the Deva Care conditioner, which was discontinued.  I’ve since moved to a different product line altogether since the Deva company don’t know what their customers need anymore.  It’s too bad because I’ve been a loyal customer for a decade and hate the idea of moving on.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl for over a year now and I love it!! First, let me say that I do not wear my hair curly. Actually, I straighten my hair on a regular basis but I have thick, coarse, dry hair and this has been the only product that I have found to help tame it down. My hair is always soft and manageable with this product and I would highly recommend it.
"
"
Fraud alert. This was not any Deva Curl product. Another substance was added to bottle and it was horrible. The smell, texture... I’ve used the real stuff multiple times and this was not it. There is a risk buying from unlicensed seller and I won’t do it again
"
"
My hair salon stylist recommended DevaCurl to me. I have very curly hair and ever since I started using this product I can see how my hair has improved. I now have a thicker mane and my curls are just jumping with volume and strength. Ever since I started using DevaCurl I now have the hair gel, hair mousse, and DevaVurls shampoo.
"
"
I've used this for years.  I love it.  It smooths over and through your hair rather than lathers and foams around it, which is very different from traditional shampoos.  Hair gets clean without getting dry or weighed down by buildup.  The few times I've had to use a different shampoo, my hair felt gross and was hard to comb through even after using a conditioner. I have naturally curly, medium thickness hair and this is the best shampoo I've found for it.
"
"
I like how my curls looks,but i don't like how stiff & tangled my hair get...really bad knots even when its not tangle wet...I think it's very expensive for what I get ....A cleansing conditioner that I get at target do better..for only 10 dlls..
"
"
Love the product, but my order came damaged, leaking all over. Shipping box looks fine.
"
"
I like it. Can’t use all the time as need  to have my hair shaft breathe.  I’ve bought the gel for clarifying as well before. I do like it but since I do need to use a lot of it to really have it work on my thick curly hair, I stopped using as is just too expensive and there are so many covwashes that work just as good I just can’t justify the $. Same with clarifier, leave in etc. the only thing I pay the $ for is their diffuser for blow drying attachment. ,,,, and still that’s a splurge for me as it’s a piece of plastic, with an incredibly high mark up.
"
"
Conditioner was a hot mess.  Looked like it exploded within the package.  Cap was not on and as you can see I lost a good portion of the conditioner.  Was not expecting this for the amount of money I spent.  Not sure if it was just a fluke or what.  Over all I do love these products.  My hair has never looked better.

Love this so far! I have been using for about 6 weeks and it has intensified my curls for sure. Using a shampoo that doesn't suds up takes some getting used to, I don't always feel that it cleans my hair thoroughly. Great price,  will last me a good amount of time!
"
"
I have being using diva curl for over a year and love how it works so well on my curls. When I first started using it I could tell a difference right away, my curls were more defined and bouncy. I also use the diva curl gel. I could tell right away that this is not the real thing. It doesnt smell the same and it actually lathers. Real DC doesnt leather. I took a chance ordering it on amazon but I will stick to purchasing else where.
"
"
I have moderately dense curly coiled  hair and this product does not work well for me.  I have to use  a lot of product just to work it through my hair and it does not  cut through product build up effectively.  I miss the smell and refreshing scalp tingle that the original no-poo provides.  This one has a very mild, non distinct lotion like smell.  I won't buy it again.
"
"
I like the price, the quality seemed ok, but slightly less than what I buy in the store. Not sure why, almost seemed watered down a little or something. I stick to the store now, my hair is very curly so a good product is important to me.
"
"
I’m a Deva Curl girl. For years I tried every shampoo and system out there and I was never totally thrilled with my curls. That is until Deva Curl. I have used every product in their line and they are all awesome. My hair has never looked better and even my stylist comments on how healthy my hair is. I’m convinced and will remain a Deva Curl girl!
"
"
I don’t actually use the products but my daughter swears by them.  She has naturally curly long hair and will only use their products.  She hasn’t noticed a difference between this from Amazon vs Ulta which i know can sometimes be any issues.
"
"
Think I like the regular No-poo better, or even the lo-poo because this is thick. Smell not as attractive to me.  Feel like I have to use a lot to clean my hair. I am not brand loyal so may work better in an ALL deva curly girl.
"
"
I’ve been using the original no-poo and conditioner for a year. After seeing the decadence line, I thought I would give it a try since I was expecting it give added moisture to my hair. I was wrong! It has dried out my hair completely. Definitely not impressed with this line. I’m pretty disappointed as the product is expensive and It will end up in the trash.
"
"
This is a great product for children with curly hair, however the packaging must be better. For a 2nd time we received them with leaking bottles.
"
"
Love this product. Best product for curly hair hands down. My curls stay gorgeous for 3 days with minimal need to refresh. Only negative is it always leaks some product during shipping. With the cost of the product and my budget this upsets me as every ounce is expensive and this I'd wasted product I can't use.
"
"
This is NOT my conditioner. This is lotion or something. I never thought it would happen to me, but I will be demanding my money back. I use this regularly. The consistency is completely different, it smells NOTHING like the real thing, and literally feels like I’m putting water in my hair. I don’t give a damn what they say, this ain’t devacurl conditioner. Period.
"
"
I have been using this duo for a while now. From all Deva Curl duos, this is the best one for my hair, for it is the most moisturizing of their hair products line. I also like that this is the last fragrant of all Deva lines. The downside is that the No-poo feels like it does not clean scalp as much as a regular shampoo or even as their No-Poo Original.
"
"
I love the decadence! I have blonde hair that is pretty curly (but not insanely) and I use it anyway. I love the smell and with any kind of curly hair, you can't go wrong with too much moisture.
"
"
Will not be buying again due to the fact that my product seemed to be watered down. I have previously purchased from deva curl and it was more thick and worked better on my hair this product on the other hand seemed super watery as if it was watered down. I've been using this product for almost a year first time purchasing from amazon I've had to use more of the product since I bought it from amazon due to it not work good on my hair. I was really upset since it is an expensive product and I thought I was getting a good deal on it. product leaves my hair dry opposed to the one I buy from deva curl.
"
"
I have been using this product for about 3 years. My hair has never looked so beautiful as it does since I began using the no poo and conditioner as well as a microfiber towel.  I also use the light gel and some live in conditioner. As any curly woman knows, moisture is essential to avoid frizz!  I’m a lifetime customer and fan of Devacurl ☺️
"
"
Let me start by saying that I having been using deva curl products for years. I have super tight curls and love how healthy my curls look after using Deva curl.  However, I am not a big fan of this particular deva product. I wanted to switch it up and try something different( I normally use the the classic no-poo shampoo and one conditioner) so I tried this Decadence set. It doesn’t seem to give my curls the shine and healthy look that I was hoping for. It may work for other curls.. just not mine.
"
"
This no poo shampoo is actually quite nice except for the fragrance. It’s too strong a scent for me. I will still use it maybe once or twice a week until it’s gone because it does a good job but I won’t purchase again
"
"
This shampoo cleans my hair and scalp. It does not dry out my hair and does not make my scalp itch. It also does not strip the hair dye color out of my hair like other brand shampoos do.
"
"
I love DevaCurl.  Have been using the Decadence cleanser and One conditioner for a couple of years now. It's the only products I use on my wavy (used to be out of control) hair.  My hair feels so much healthier with DevaCurl products. Goodbye to frizz!
"
"
My daughter and I both have curly coily hair. Her's is thick and mine is thin. But we both keep reordering it because it defines our curls just the way we like it.
"
"
If you have curly hair, this is the HOLY GRAIL. I have been washing my hair wrong my entire life and now my curls look super healthy. And it smells amazing! Do your curls a favor!
"
"
I've been a ""curly girl"" for 3 years.  I was quite curious...so when the price was right I got the decadence duo.  My hair really likes variety, so I believe I will alternate using decadence duo with the original duo.  Even though the decadence products are thicker, they still don't weigh heavily on my hair.  I'm very pleased and am having fun playing.
"
"
I swear by this product. Being natural, it's always hard to find things that are gentle but also do a great job of cleansing your hair. This is the perfect product. I'm not a fan of their styling products (not enough hold) but their no poo cleanser is the best! I've used devacurl no poo and conditioner before with mixed results but their decadence line made me a full time believer!
"
"
Love the DivaCurl product line! I have fine, curly hair that damages easily with heat and other products. These products help keep my hair looking healthier and with bouncier curls. They keep my frizz to a minimum, I cannot see myself using any other products.
"
"
The only time I didn't love my curls was when I wasn't using Deva no-poo. This is an improvement on already good product. This is even richer and more gentile cleanser. Great for us kinky-curly girls who tend to have dry hair.
"
"
Works well but doesn't have much of a scent. It's extremely on the plain side. It does well with it drying your hair out and leaves it manable to comb through.I would recommend this product to any natural curly hair person!!!
"
"
I love NoPoo. I have really curly and incredibly dry hair. I don't even straighten my hair or anything but yet my hair is always so dry and the ends just break off.NoPoo Decadence always leaves my hair super soft. I love this size because it lasts longer and it's a great deal considering the price of the smaller bottles. I would purchase again and definitely recommend.
"
"
My hair hair has been an angry, untenable monster since 3rd grade. This combo have calmed my hair more than any hair products I've tried so far. Never going back.
"
"
I love how this stuff makes my hair feel. A little goes a lot and it has such a nice feeling. It makes my curls really stand out as well. I love how it has an easy pump. A lot of people complement my hair and ask which products I use, I've been proudly saying DevaCurl!
"
"
This is my 4th time buying this combo and I love it. I’ve heard of some fake products going around, but I must say that this is not the case here. I will continue to purchase this product in the future!
"
"
The nonlather aspect takes some getting used to but it does a great job of cleaning my scalp and doesn’t result in any buildup or dryness. I’ve recommended this to many of my curly hairs friends and they love it as well.
"
"
My wife bought these to maintain her diva cut and they worked just as expected. She was able to teach or older children how to use the products as well.The products work as promised, and the better your technique at their application, the better your results. The effects, I noticed, are long-lasting. You can easily apply it once a week and it would be effective.
"
"
CAUSING MY DAUGHTER TO LOSE HER HAIRI THOUGHT SHE WAS COOCOO BUT THERE IS A FACEBOOK GROUP PAGE THAT IS DEDICATED TO OTHERS THIS IS HAPPENING TO AND ALSO YOU TUNESHE’S BEEN USING FOR 3 YEARS AND IT HAS DAMAGED HER GORGEOUS CURLY HAIR!!!
"
"
Great value, love the product, it doesn't have a strong scent.  Very moisturizing for my curly hair.  I have ordered this product again and again.
"
"
I have loose curls, this is best shampoo conditioner I’ve used. Since using I have gotten tons of compliments and people asking how I have my curls look so good. I also use the deva curl gel.
"
"
Good conditioner - one annoying part is that it feels impossible to rinse off your skin with our water type. (Well water)Answer- put it in, wring it out, put hair up in a rubber band, and don't let the conditioned hair touch your skin.I do love what it does to our family's hair- great curls...
"
"
I buy this for my neice who has very curly hair. She loves it!!!!!!! It helps condition & keep the curls beautiful as well as smelling great. Perfect product at a great price.
"
"
My daughters hair is a nightmare. It’s frizzy but curly and it’s frightening to try to deal with. This literally takes her semi-Afro and turns it into sleek curls....if only the accompanying hair cream from them had actually arrived.
"
"
Highly anticipated using both products since 1) I have 3c hair, and 2) my hair took so well to the original No Poo and One Condition.... I've washed my hair 3 times since receiving these products (tried to give it a 2nd and 3rd chance), and my hair is not responding well at all... 1) I have to use wayyy more of this product compared to the original. 2) The first use was by far the worst dectangle I've had in 8 years of being natural (the 2nd and 3rd weren't so bad). 3) Unlike the original One Condition, I was not able to use this conditioner throughout the week as a 'curl refresher'; it left my hair feeling like there was a film left on it. ....I gave it 2 stars bc I do like the scent, but my hair has not enjoyed the Decadence products at all :(
"
"
Pretty sure this is either diluted or a knock off. It barely smells and absolutely doesn’t work. I use this product regularly on my daughter, and this version from shine on beauty is definitely not the real deal. I didn’t open it until the other bottle ran out and now I am out of the return window. Not happy.
"
"
Did not receive the decadence shampoo. I got the regular ""original no poo"" shampoo instead. It's not that I dont like that kind... but I paid more to get the decadence.... oh well I guess. It stinks but my hair feels amazing.
"
"
Unfortunately, this is not what it claims to be. It has no smell (Devs Curl products have a strong smell) and it really does nothing for your hair. Don’t by this product!
"
"
I have thin, curly, very dry hair, but this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair smooth and voluminous. I have tried a lot of different shampoos and conditioners, but this works the best
"
"
This curly girl will NOT be anything but a Deva, and we LOVE the new Decadence line!  Great price and terrific shipping time!
"
"
I have used Deva products exclusively for years and am never disappointed.  I have tried other brands but never get the same results in terms of frizz elimination and natural curliness.
"
"
I like how the product is a little cheaper than in the store... but, when i got the product the bottle wasnt even filled to the top with conditioner and the cleanse. Why isnt it filled to the top. Its alot thats not even filling up the empty bottle space..... Im not mad im just disappointed...
"
"
Although it seems like a good deal do not cut corners! This is not real DevaCurl products!! I compared the details on the packaging (directions and such) to the other products I own & even the packaging isn’t the same.
"
"
GREAT PRICE FOR THE SET! PACKAGED GREAT AND SEEMS LIKE THE REAL PRODUCT YOU GET FROM A SALON.
"
"
Im giving this a 1 because i cant give a 0 star. I used this product for 5 months. Over those 5 months I started to notice some extra hair in the tub, then a little more. Suddenly one day I take a shower I had handfuls of my hair. Multiple handfuls. Im devastated as i now have bald spots. I advised looking twice and really research before using this.
"
"
This is the non-stinky one. The original works well but smells terrible
"
"
Good cleanser and great slip. It has really helped my very curly hair.
"
"
Best hair product!  Been using for years.  Won’t use anything else.
"
"
I love Devacurl and coconut even better!!! Great with curly hair!!
"
"
I purchased this on a recommendation and am very happy I did. I have thick, curly, frizzy hair. The shampoo and conditioner left my hair clean, so soft, and smelling great. The duo were shipped on time, as described (1 shampoo and 1 conditioner) and double wrapped. As a matter of fact, I am going to buy another set from this same seller!
"
"
A mi en lo personal no me funciono este shampoo! Ya había comprado este shampoo en ulta, pero la fragancia era diferente , y aparte le daba brillo en el cabello a mi hija ! Pero cómo es caro decidí comprarlo aquí . Lamentablemente no le cae bien a mi hija y ya no lo puedo regresar y aparte es bien grande he invertí mucho dinero .
"
"
This was OK for a shampoo, I did like how light it felt on my hair, but didn't do much for frizz.
"
"
I prefer the scent of the DevaCurl Decadence line compared to the original. The product is great. I took off a star because both bottles had leaked during shipment.
"
"
I love this product! I have had dry scalp, and after using this no poo shampoo my scalp has healed and there is no flakes! Great product!
"
"
Looooove the product.  This and a REAL cut by a Deva Stylist makes a hugeeeee difference.  Just wish there was more packaging so the bottles didn't leak.
"
"
I'm a Diva Curl girl so this was perfect. Cheaper than buying it from the company to as you don't have to pay for shipping if you have Prime
"
"
Great product. Poor packaging. One of the lids wasn't tightened all the way and a bunch of product leaked out. Very frustrating since this stuff is pretty expensive.
"
"
Love this product!!!! Works great!! Softens my hair!!
"
"
Makes bouncy non-greasy curls.
"
"
Very think, I needed to add water. This is not the same product as the real company diva curl product. Recomend shopping directly at the diva curl website. Amazon is not partners with diva curl
"
"
Came broken :(
"
"
Love the stuff
"
"
The smell was too much for me, went back to original
"
"
My hair is somewhere between 2B and 2C and this product works very well for me. This shampoo itself detangles my hair, which never happened with any other shampoo.  Sometimes hair masks don't detangle my hair.I've purchased a set of shampoo and conditioner twice already and I am very happy with both.
"
"
Works great, smells great, my hair looks terrific.
"
"
My daughter has extremely curly hair and loves all Devacurl products. We reorder these products on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. We highly recommend the No-Poo Decadence.
"
"
I already love deva curl because it works miracles with my hair. But this price was by far the best I could find. I will be purchasing again!
"
"
Love this stuff for my curly hair that surprised me about 3 years ago after menopause.  This shampoo and conditioner are the ONLY thing I found that works.  Getting the combo pack saves some $ too.
"
"
Love the product but I cannot stand the smell.
"
"
Recommended by my salon stylist. Better value than retail.
"
"
This stuff is a game changer if you have any sort of frizzy hair. I won’t go back to detergent-based shampoos ever again. I use about half the amount of leave-in product that I used to. Great stuff.
"
"
I have 3bc hair. Didn’t moisturize my hair, don’t get the hype.
"
"
Leaves hair that is very coarse and very curly dry looking.
"
"
If you are sensitive to perfumes BEWARE:  This does not smell like Deva Curl Original.  To my nose it stinks.
"
"
I'm addicted. I had a bad problem with my scalp breaking out with normal shampoo and conditioner. Ever since I've been using this, no problem at all. I thought it would make my hair greasy, or oily.. NO! I love it. My hair is soft! Def worth the money I spent!
"
"
Although I love this conditioner, when my package arrived, the contents of the bottle were all over the outside of the bottle making it sticky all over the outside. NOT what I payed for! I want a refund or another one sent to me, this product is already expensive, so unfair!
"
"
I've been experimenting with different curly hair products for the last few months.  This is a winner.  I ordered the largest size.  My hair is a 2c or 3a and can frizz a bit on top if I'm not careful.  The Decadence is heavier on the conditioner.
"
"
I have been using Diva products for over 6 years and have  found them to be of good quality and easy on my hair. I did find that the conditioner didn't seem to have much of a smell.
"
"
Wife loves the stuff. Thank God there's no poo though otherwise I don't think I could share a bed with her.
"
"
Just the best. This changed my hair. I have naturally curly hair, but straighten it. This is the best for me. I've also recommended to several others with different hair, and they all love it too.
"
"
This product is changing my daughters hair. I made her stop using it and have read that diva curl is making hair fall out. Can I send the products back to you?
"
"
Fun curly hair products will buy again ! Great for my hair texture.
"
"
Pereect.
"
"
Really enhances natural curl
"
"
I made sure that I bought the decadence Devacurl duo, well I got was the devacurl original instead of the one I purchase and have been using for quite some time now.  The Deva curl Original are ok products, not the best thing in the world  for my super curly hair really.  Im just disappointed that I didn't  get the products that I know I paid for.
"
"
This would be 5 stars (I really do love this product), but I got 2 bottles of one condition instead of one bottle of no poo and one of one condition. Which wiuld be fine, except I am out of no poo and will now have to get some ordered or go pick it up at ulta for a much higher price. I guess I will not need to order any conditioners for a while.
"
"
For tangly unmanageable hair
"
"
Oh my God, yes!! If you are a curly or wavy hair girl, you have to give this a try!! I was hoping that I would hate these magical beauties because I’m cheap, but I can’t live without them. ❤️🙌🏾
"
"
I did not see any difference to my curls
"
"
This was a gift for my BFF who loves this stuff. It did not ship well. It was a week late and leaked in transit. Bottles weren't broken and I only lost about a 1/2 cup of shampoo (which smelled amazing) so I didn't return it.
"
"
Product is illegitimate. Doesn’t have the consistency as other devacurl Shampoo I purchased from Ulta. Don’t buy.
"
"
Awesome stuff. I switch between products and my curls just pop! Great on low porous hair.
"
"
Love the smell and how it keeps my hair clean without sulfates drying it out!
"
"
Makes my daughter's hair greasy feeling.
"
"
I'm not sure what happened but I ordered 2 of this so far and they both smell different, feel different. One has to be a fake. I wont buy again.
"
"
My wife likes this sh!t, it makes her hair happy, which makes her happy, which is why I gave it 5 stars!
"
"
Nice smell and works well. I prevfer it over the previous decade nopoos I’ve used.
"
"
I wouldn't buy again ...i think water or something was added
"
"
The conditioner smelled rancid! I don’t think it was the real deal. I have puchased this product from Ulta Beauty store beforeand it never smelled the way this bottle did.
"
"
I love these products. It took awhile to get used to the fact that the shampoo does not create a lather. The products leave my thick, course, curly hard soft and untangled.
"
"
I love this shampoo and conditioner! It really enhances my natural curls. I leave in a little of the conditioner when I rinse my hair and I don't need to use any gel or mouse on my hair to control my curls, plus the frizz is gone.
"
"
Great value
"
"
Great product
"
"
Best products I have used in a long time!!! And for the price it’s amazing!!
"
"
I love this stuff, hair feels moisturized and healthy. It works great for my naturally curly 3b hair which I straighten all the time.
"
"
This product has saved my curly hair! I could tell a difference after the first use.
"
"
Best cleanser I've ever used on my 4B hair
"
"
This DevaCurl set is wonderful & really does great things for my curly hair. My only complaint is with the way that it was shipped. When I opened the box, I found that the conditioner had leaked. Surprisingly, this was shipped by Amazon. Hopefully this isn't a common occurrence!
"
"
Works as expected and cheaper than the salon.
"
"
Great conditioner! The smell is so wonderful!
"
"
Thanks
"
"
Great shampoo
"
"
Love these products. I play sports and am outside often. My curly hair is in way better condition with these products.
"
"
I love this product
"
"
I love the way it makes my hair feel.
"
"
I love Deva Curl products for my curly hair. Lightweight, and smells good.
"
"
GREAT product for the best price I've found.
"
"
We have been using Deva Curl products for over 4 years and we love them. They are the best!
"
"
Trying this product for the first time. Really like it. My curls are not as frizzy and seem to have more bounce.
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
Horrible. Made my hair thin and fall out. Do not purchase
"
"
Gave this one to my daughter. It's nice, but I like the original better.
"
"
Not the products fault. Found out it is for really coarse hair.
"
"
As advertised.
"
"
Ok
"
"
When i bought this product, devacurl no-poo, the bottle I received was missing a substantial amount of the product! Probably at least 6 shampoos worth!
"
"
Have to get used to the not lathering thing. But cleanses fine and the conditioner is amazing. Has great slip for detangling, haven’t used a brush since using this conditioner. It is also very moisturizing.
"
"
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it.
"
"
I love devacurl products, but I received this one more than a week after ordering and it came exploded in bag.
"
"
Excellent product for curly hair. My local hair stylist showed me how to use it properly and now my beautiful curly hair looks marvelous.
"
"
I have think hair with a ton of volume. I feel like the decadence weighs a little more on my hair making it less frizzy. Excellent choice for curly/wavy hair!
"
"
This. Smells. Amazing. I have tried DevaCare and DevaCurl, this is by far my favorite scent and it is even more moisturizing than DevaCurl.
"
"
Does what it said it does, helped me greatly with my frizzy curls.
"
"
Love it
"
"
My curls are so defined and maintain their shape now. They are so soft and bouncy! I use the coconut supercream after towel drying. Stick with it, you won’t see results after the first use but over a few washes, your hair starts to maintain its natural oils. So worth the money!
"
"
Bye for a friend very good price
"
"
Dry hair
"
"
Received wrong product. Ordered 2 no-poo decadence products and received no-poo ""original"".
"
"
Great product for all types of hair
"
"
I ordered in March 2017 from the seller czbm and just pulled out of my linen closet to use. The product is fake- doesn’t have the same smell or consistency of authentic devacurl and the label is a bad dupe. Fake is on the left in each photo.
"
"
I love this product, best thing for natural curls. However, I received two no-poo and no conditioner. I wrote a message hoping to resolve the issue but didn't hear back.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
It leaves the hair soft and clean
"
"
My has been using the devaCurl products for over a year and love them.
"
"
Not enough words to express how much I love DevaCurl.
"
"
Works great on my hair!
"
"
makes my hair soft.
"
"
Smells like coconut! Very freshing. The new formula is super creamy and glides in curly hair. WILL be reordering.
"
"
It's the real product!
"
"
This product is AMAZING for curly hair! Even after one use my hair feels lighter and less frizzy! If you are going to buy this, make sure to also use a microfiber towel for your hair to maximize the frizz control!
"
"
Love this product! My hair is very curly and on the drier side. This keeps it moisturized and healthy looking. I recommend to all curly haired friends out there!
"
"
This hair product is amazing. I got it for my daughter who has curly hair, and its amazing she doesn't complain abot brushing her hair anymore. I would reccomend this product to anyone who has curly hair.
"
"
Love the product but was spilled all in bag/box when I received it.
"
"
There is not a lot to say.  Great product that leaves my hair silky and clean.
"
"
Duo? Only received the no poo. It leaked in transit. Returning.
"
"
Love it!  Makes my hair feel luxurious!!
"
"
This is not the real product. This totally dried out my hair and created build up. I kept trying to see if it would work and now I missed my return window and am left with a big bottle of useless product
"
"
Great Price for product.
"
"
I have used this product for the last 3 cleanings. I had been using Redkin Creme shampoo. I dont see a difference.Perhaps in time I will.
"
"
I use it as a leave in conditioner.
"
"
Perfect for 3c to 4c curls!
"
"
I have bought this same shampoo/conditioner pack from this supplier once a month for the last several months. The delivery is super fast and it is the best price I have found on Amazon or anywhere.  Amazing product for curly hair. Highly recommended.
"
"
What I didn't like was the fact that one bottle leaked. Shampoo all over inside of bag.
"
"
This not working for myself
"
"
Great product. Like the light fragrance. Leaves my hair soft and clean.
"
"
My curls have never looked better!
"
"
I like the normal devacurl better. This one is not as oily which I need since I have pretty dry hair and not a big fan of this products smell
"
"
Love this product! Keeps my curly hair soft and hydrated.
"
"
just tried this for the first time, like it much better than the original. leaves my hair soft and shiny!
"
"
Improved texture of my very dry hair
"
"
First of all, I have coarse wiry non-color treated red hair that is probably 2a in terms of waviness. It tends to be dry and it damages easily with or without heat styling. I've been struggling to find the right shampoo and conditioner for my hair that reduces the damage and makes it a little softer for some time. Prior to this shampoo I'd been using Pureology Hydrate shampoo and conditioner for about a year as my hair feels as though it's been color treated but it didn't seem to help all that much.While this product is made for women with curly hair, I decided to try it on mine, hoping it would help keep my ends from getting crispy dry and that it might ease some of the wiriness. Lucky for me it has really made a difference! My hair has a little more weight using this shampoo, but for the texture of my hair, that's certainly not a bad thing. It's also emphasized my slight waves and has given them more definition when I air dry (and even more if I diffuse). I've noticed a significant difference in the way the ends of my hair feel over the month that I've been using it. It takes longer to blow out my hair straight due to the added product in my hair and I have noticed that I use less product overall with it. The one that I've been sticking to is Kerastase Touche Finale-- it's really just enough.It also smells wonderful, so wonderful that my fiance uses it on his <1"" stick straight hair. The pumps work great, and the size of the bottles/duo shipment gives you some value on a fairly expensive product (it's nowhere near as expensive as Pureology though, so I'm laughing to the bank). If your hair is anything like mine, I'd highly recommend it.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Me agrada mucho
"
"
Wish they version smelt as good as original.  Do not feel it gives any more moisturizing then the original.
"
"
The beat products for curly hair!
"
"
If I could give it more stars I would. It smells amazing and it's very good for my curly hair.

The pump is almost impossible to loosen but I like the product.
"
"
Still gonna try it, but about a quarter of each bottle was lost before it even arrived. Shipping box okay, but the products were damaged.
"
"
PERRRRFECT!!
"
"
If you have very curly thick hair, look not further. Deva products are amazing. My hair has never looked this good.
"
"
Awesome product. Makes my hair very soft. May be too heavy for someone with finer curls
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Got here fast awesome shampoo and condintioner I love this product
"
"
Love this new DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner.. Received product extremely quickly and was exactly what I expected, good price too!
"
"
Me deja el cabello súper suave es magnifico
"
"
Have been using this for years!
"
"
This product just does work for my hair. I normally look for more slip. I actually find that As I Am Leave in conditioner works wonders.
"
"
I like the conditioner better than the shampoo. Great product, wish the price point were lower.
"
"
I have curly hair, so this is the perfect because it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. Addicted to this product.
"
"
I've always been happy with DevaCurl products and this one didn't disappoint. However, I do not have oily hair and I wash my hair 2-3 times a week, so if you wash it more often, you still might get dry hair.
"
"
Love this line of shampoo. Since using my hair has less breakage and has increased in length.
"
"
It's exactly as advertised
"
"
Can't go wrong with this if you're a curly gal like me :)
"
"
This has a powdery smell and is leaving my hair greasy. Clearly a knock off. Save your money. I wish I did.
"
"
I luv this product, too bad it arrived in such poor condition (box was ok)....still useable of course just an inconvenience 😕
"
"
I have used this Brand many times and I don't know if the formulas have changed dramatically or if this is not the true brand product.  I was very disappointed.
"
"
I gave it four stars because this product is AMAZING, it did however come opened in the box. Thankfully it was only one bottle and not all three.
"
"
Love it!!
"
"
Luv, luv, luv this conditioner. I use as a co-wash and it is fantastic. Really really great moisturizer
"
"
The whole like is great for the curly hair!!!!  Lots of bouncy curls
"
"
While I personally LOVE the product, the packaging was not done correctly and it leaked inside the box (see attached picture).
"
"
I love this brand and this decadence line didn’t hesitate to impress me! I will def be purchasing this again! Shipping was quick and packaging was efficiently
"
"
Best hair products I’ve ever used since I’ve decided to go all natural with my hair👍🏽
"
"
Leaves a my hair clean. Use with the deep conditioner and my hair hasn't felt better
"
"
Love how this product works on my daughter’s hair. Sad I lost money on it spilling out during shipping.
"
"
This is my first time using no-poo.  I am still checking it out, but so far so good.
"
"
Excellent!!!
"
"
Fake or expiered product with a very strong chemical smell.
"
"
This does not clean your hair. It’s supposed to be a cleaner but it only conditions. Not happy with this product.
"
"
My hair loved this product. My curls did exactly what they should do...bounce with freedom.
"
"
I ordered the wrong product within Deva line, tried it, determined it was a not as effective as the original Deva No-poo and conditioner. Returned it.
"
"
Works wonders, never want to use any other shampoo and conditioner
"
"
Both of these are really great! The no-poo is nice because it has no lather, so it doesn't leave your hair dry. And the One-condition is really hydrating. Definitely buying again :)
"
"
Definitely not the real deal. Does not have the smell or texture of real Deva Curl.
"
"
Love the way it leaves my curls.  Moisturized thoroughly.  Using this almost exclusively I thought I may feel a build up on my hair but I don't.  It's easy to use, smells great and has really helped my dry hair.  I will continue to use this.
"
"
Arrived damaged! The cap was not screwed on one of the bottles and most of the cleanser leaked out. Definitely going to return.
"
"
Started using on my toddlers very curly hair. With in 3 weeks there is an obvious difference.
"
"
Product was faulty. The caps were not twisted on which allowed the product to spill all over the inside of the bag it came in
"
"
I have super curly, frizzy, unruly hair - and I live in the South, home of humidity. Deva Curl is THE BEST product I've ever used for curly hair. It will transform your hair.
"
"
A great solution for dry/died hair.
"
"
Love this product!! I have used Deva for the past 7 years. I would recommend to use.
"
"
Awesome for curly hair
"
"
For my curly hair, perfect. Price is a problem, may need to find an alternative the next time
"
"
IM in doubt about this product! It Smells different and watery!  I have a feeling That this is FAKE!!!
"
"
Excellent!  Ill never use anything else.
"
"
works great would recommend - with the conditioner too
"
"
Lol
"
"
I am 4a natural and these products makes my hair soft and moisturize. Will buy again
"
"
Love it
"
"
I love Deva curl products, but watch the shipping my pumps on the bottles arrived broken today
"
"
I use this product on my 2 year old mixed child's hair. He has very tight corkscrew curls (when properly cared for!), which if not washed daily get extremely dry and frizzy. Deva curl is AMAZING. I have found a certain way that I use the cleanser and conditioner for the maximum corkscrew curl-age from top to bottom! I shampoo it and let it sit for about 5 minutes while he finishes up playing in the tub. Then I don't quite rinse it all the way and add in the conditioner and again, let it sit for another 5 minutes. By the time I'm ready to rinse (again, don't quite rinse it all out) I can run my fingers all the way through. I'm super picky about his hair and Deva Curl Decadence is WELL worth the money (I'm also a single mom...so tight budget!)
"
"
Works well but the only thing is I can't use it on colored hair
"
"
Best poo ever
"
"
This is not a genuine product it is fake
"
"
Love it for my curly hair has never looked so good!Thank you!
"
"
I lost my hair with DevaCurl products
"
"
This is awesome for dry, curly hair!
"
"
It does exactly what it says... my curls are gorgeous using devacurl!
"
"
Does make my curls feel any better
"
"
I was supposed to get one bottle of cleanser and one bottle of conditioner. Instead, I received two bottles of cleanser. I didn't realize this until I'd already opened the bottles, so I couldn't return them. Great price; wish I'd received the correct products.
"
"
I love love love this product!!
"
"
Ordered this product and didn’t receive the Decadence line but received the original.  Sending it back!
"
"
Best curly hair products - ever!!!!
"
"
Leaves my hair feeling so clean and light. Has helped my curls come back to life.
"
"
Love this brand. My hair is much softer.
"
"
Package was broken open and leaking when I got this
"
"
Love this shampoo! Works great for thick coarse curly hair.
"
"
The bottles are huge! Love the product.
"
"
Ordered original Deva formula received a different one. A little disappointed but will try.
"
"
Really helps with frizz and tangles.
"
"
I've experienced hair loss And noticed more flakes in my hair  since using this product. I'm not so sure this product works for all hair types and the sad thing is I heard such good things about it & it was super expensive I feel the need to use it until it's gone.
"
"
Left my hair feeling soft and conditioned. Smells great.
"
"

"
"
Have struggled with finding the right products for my curly hair all my life. Absolutely LOVE DevaCurl products. Highly recommend.
"
"
Not sure if the product is truley Deva Curl or out dated. Doesn't have the wonderful scent or work as well as what I purchased at my local salon.
"
"
Awesome product, great price!
"
"
love love love the decadence line. great moisture and the best price ever... love AMAZON
"
"
I love this shampoo and conditioner. Changed my life.
"
"
The one condition is amazing!!!
"
"
Me daño mi cabello
"
"
Love it. Leaves my hair soft.
"

This smells amazing!! I really like this stuff better than the other no-poo.
"
"
expensive but nice product

Best shampoo for curly hair!
"
"
I started wearing my hair curly in March of 2015.  Since that time I've become a bit of a product junkie, not by choice, and had several BAD hair days!  After trying product after product, I was becoming a bit disappointed.  Then a friend told me about DevaCurl.  I was a little hesitant to invest in it due to the price tag.  After buying a ""starter kit"" at ULTA, I was hooked!!  The cost to buy a 32oz of the No-Poo and One Condition together is about $30 less from this seller.  Also, I find that using the no-poo 1 time per month works much better, it can be slightly drying if I use it too often.  I don't need to use as much product or leave-in when I use the One Condition by itself on most of my wash days.  My hair retains more moisture and the natural oils from my hair keep it hydrated.
"
"
SO MUCH YES! If you have curly hair, you NEED this in your life. Just try it. You won't be disappointed!
"
"
Is very good!  I don't love the price... But i love everything else, is soften my hair and smells very well!  Also is very good for ny scalp
"
"
It got here in 3 days! Yippee! I love this stuff
"
"
Curly hair
"
"
Great products and service from vendor.
"
"
Great
"
"
This product is amazing it makes my hair so soft and very curly.
"
"
Smells soooooo good!
"
"
If you have waves or curly hair this is the only shampoo to use.
"
"
I've been using this for my curly hair and I love it. It leaves it soft and smooth. Both items came in perfect condition.
"
"
excellent price excellent product the 32oz size was exactly what i was looking for
"
"
Great product
"
"
Great smelling Deva product!
"
"
Arrived with the plastic pump shattered and conditioner all over.. so frustrating paying all this money for that
"
"
Great product for very curly hair!
"
"
I love deva no-poo and it's been a huge game-changer for my hair, but this stuff smells terrible. Kind of like baby powder/dove bar. I get that some people like that, but if you're not into those scents I don't recommend that you use this stuff. I had to add rose geranium oil to my bottle in order to counteract some of the smell. Otherwise it works about like the original stuff did, and gets the job done. I wouldn't say that it does a better job by any means, and I will be purchasing the original formula for my next bottle even though it costs more.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
I love how this product makes my hair feel and look!
"
"
Love Deva  Products condition and no poo bring moisture to my curly hair.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Nothing better for curly hair
"
"
Love this product. My curls have officially been revitalized.
"
"
I will never use another shampoo!! This is the best for course/curly hair.
"
"
Its fine. Other reviewers have commented on the scent. It's a bit odd but I didn't mind it. The scent of regular no poo is odd too in a totally different way but after years of using it I don't mind it. I will go back to regular no poo though because my hair feels more conditioned with it.
"
"
Beware, is a fake product. I get my hair cut at Devachan Salon and it is not the same product. This dried out my hair terribly. Buy direct from Devachan. Do not be fooled by this.
"
"
I love this product and the large size is perfect.
"
"
My scalp felt refreshed and good.
"
"
Love what this does for my curls!
"
"
It is good but the original is better
"
"
Love this product it's so moisturizing and I love the smell
"
"
Definitely not the greatest product.
"
"
Perfect! Just as described, awesome seller!!
"
"
Disappointed!!  I love Deva Curl, but these products were watered down.  Guess I will go back to purchasing directly from Deva Curl website!
"
"
These products are must haves for anyone with curly, dry hair. My hair always feels well moisturized.
"
"
My curly hair and I LOVE this product!
"
"
I love this product
"
"
Not the decadence line
"
"
Best curly hair shampoo ever!
"
"
Love this! Saw defined curls right after use..
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Like the Deva Care much better.  I have better curls
"
"
I received regular No Poo. NOT the Decadence version I ordered. Didn't realize until after I opened it. Needless to say, will not be ordering again. Sloppy business at best and dishonest at worst.
"
"
Great product!  The best for curly hair.
"
"
Great haircare product! I try different hair products all the time but I always come back to DevaCurl!
"
"
Love this no poo and conditioner even better than the original.  Great shipping speed and good price.
"
"
I love this product! Arrived fast
"
"
Just what I wanted
"
"
I rec'vd the set of No-Poo and Conditioner.  I like it.  The scent is light and clean.  The formula does seem to glide through my often very tangled 3C curls and offers good de-tangling as well.  I am not a giant fan of the price for this, but it is a very good product that will not build-up on your hair.  It seems to give my curls a good start for the styling process, and a good foundation does allow my curls to last 4 to 5 days between washings.  That said, if you use it only 4 to 5 times per month, I suppose the price dissipates as it will last me well over one year.  Depending on the amount you use per wash/condition, it may last a longer or shorter amount of time for you.
"
"
Love it! Smells great!
"
"
Really like them
"
"
great product with great fragrance.
"
"
This product is better for my hair, has more conditioner in it. Really enjoy it.
"
"
Obsessed with this product!
"
"
Not a big fan of the no-lather.
"
"
Hate the perfume scent. Didn't feel like it cleaned my scalp as nicely.
"
"
I've used the Deva Curl and Deva Care for years- Love them! At first I wasn't in love with this, it almost seemed to leave a coating on my hair and I felt like it was getting oily... I'm not sure what has changed, but I really like it now. It leaves your hair smooth and untangled. Smells great too. I wouldn't say the results are significantly different than the other 2 formulas for me though.
"
"
Love the new DevaCurl products.
"
"
Love this product!!!
"
"
I was so excited to try this line. I have dark, thick, frizzy, curly hair. Been using this product for only a week and I won't be continuing, my hair doesn't get clean and is oily and gross by the end of the day.Smells good and the conditioner is great but the shampoo not so much. Love the scarf after I figured out how to use it. Which is why I gave it at least 2 stars.
"
"
AMAZING product for my curly hair, and you cannot beat this price!
"
"
Awesome product!  Leaves my curls moisturized and bouncy!
"
"
Great price and arrived on time
"
"
Perfect

Kind to hair and health, this shampoo does not contain all those terrible additives that threaten our health--parabens, phthalates, etc.  Be aware that it does not suds and froth as typical shampoos do, but that is the healthy result of the lack of nasty additives.
"
"
As someone who suffered with frizzy hair, I'm ashamed of myself for taking so long to take the Deva plunge.I wasn't sure what products to get, so I grabbed these and the difference was immediately noticeable after just the first use. Now that I've been using it regularly the changes in my hair have amazed me, and it's nice to have curly hair instead of a frizzy mess.
"
"
better than the ordinal deva curl one conditioner and smell better. I use as a leave in conditioner for styling. I use it on my daughters thick curly hair and it does what it say it does. no frizz  lots of shine.
"
"
Exactly what we wanted!!
"
"
I really like this product, but find after a week or two I need to use the original cleaning product for my hair to feel clean.
"
"
Love this product!!!!
"
"
I've used the original DevaCurl No-Poo product and thought I would order this kind as it's supposed to be more moisturizing.  Well, it works fine....but IT STINKS!  The scent of this product is reminiscent of old lady's perfume!  It's too expensive not to use and it does last a while so I'm stuck with it but I won't order Decadence ever again.  The original No-Poo smells so fabulous, along with all the other Deva Curl line, but they really bombed on this one.
"
"
Ordered with amazon and got exactly the same product I got from DevaCurl directly for a much better price.  I love them to death! Just to test it out I used this on my normal wash day. But for my mid-week wash I used the regular versions of the One Condition and No-Poo. My hair instantly felt drier than it did after using the Decadence versions a few day prior. This stuff really does work. I have 4a,b, and some C hair. I use coconut oil and the regular styling cream and my hair is extra happy all week long. I actually have not had a need to put any oil directly on my scalp as of late. Just and fyi.
"
"
It's ok. I like that it doesn't foam up. Much better for my curls but I wish it had more of a scent. Doesn't have much of a scent. But what little scent it has is a clean nice scent
"
"
Súper
"
"
The product did detangle my hair and left it very soft. However, the downside to this product, is that I had to use more than I typically would with the original DevaCurl One Condition and Cleanser. I am definitely not a fan of the fragrance which reminds of downy fabric softner!
"
"
Items arrived with masking tape (the yellow tape) over the top of pump dispenser. Product had leaked on both the shampoo and conditioner bottles.  The shampoo smells identical to what I purchased in salon, but conditioner feels and smells different. My hair is now frizzy and dry - with salon purchased product (same product) my hair was not frizzy, was hydrated, and felt soft. Amazon customer svc is amazing and did refund my money, but please know the conditioner is a fake - not original Deva Curl Decadence you purchase in salon!
"
"
Love the product, and how it hydrates my curls, but the seller's packaging was faulty. The top of the No-Poo shampoo burst, causing more one-third of the product to be all over both bottles and unusable.Will continue to purchase, but from other sellers.
"
"
Less drying than the original, but doesn't leave my hair gunked up or weighed down like some other no-poo/co-wash products I've tried. I love it! I use it on average about 1x/week and it's just cleansing enough that I feel clean, yet not so astringent that my scalp overcompensates or feels dry/itchy over the next few days. I have medium- to low-porosity hair that tends towards a dry scalp with dry hair in my native CA climate. 10/10 will continue to use it!
"
"
I love this stuff and won't use anything else. I have oily, slightly wavy, fine hair that I wash daily because I work out daily. I have to scrub my scalp like with a regular shampoo to keep it from looking stringy after my hair is dry but it gets my hair clean! The most miraculous thing I've noticed since I started using this shampoo a year ago is that I no longer get split ends - and I blow dry my hair straight almost every day! Even my stylist, who sells Aveda products, comments on how healthy my hair is since I've started using this shampoo!
"
"
Have used No-Poo for a very long time. This formula seems to be even more moisturizing for my long, thick, 3C hair. I miss the peppermint smell/feel of the original, though. This is a bit more floral/fruity.
"
"
Love this stuff! It is the only thing I have found that makes a difference with my hair since I moved to the South.
"
"
If you're doing the Curly Girl Method, there's no better place to start than here. I thought that I could get away with doing cowashes with just any conditioner (and some people can - when done right!) but my buildup was crazy. I finally gave in and bought No-Poo and with only a quarter-sized amount my hair feels cleaner than it ever was with shampoos that contain sulfate.
"
"
I use to love Deva Curl & was using it for over a year. Then I started to have clumps of hair coming out & after months of trying to figure out what was causing it, I went on vacation & decided not to pack this but took other travel size products. Low & behold, the very first time I used a regular shampoo, I stopped losing hair & it has been growing back nicely ever since. So even if it works for a while, beware of potential hair loss.
"
"
The best for my 4c hair I have never been able to part my hair in two and completely brush through each side with such ease as this two products provide rinse and add super cream then b leave in conditioner with eco styler Aragon oil glazed on top great 3-4 day hair worth the money these will last me 4-5 months
"
"
I'm am a Devacurl devotee and have been using the original no-poo and one c for years on my 3b curls. My hair is loving the decadence line. Once I cleanse and condition, I use the conditioner as a leave-in/styling cream along with the ultra defining gel.  The result is bouncy, shiny curls.  I really love the smell too.
"
"
hello. I must say something about not the product itself, but rather shipment. and it was to get me this product with less because spilled on the package. and I really do not feel well.
"
"
Bottle busted open.
"
"
I love this product. Heard about it leaving too much buildup or it not making hair feel clean,I'd say if your hair feels that way it's cause you don't have dry hair. Decadence is perfect for my hair . No poo leaves hair feeling clean and one condition leaves hair easy to detangle and so soft and my curls come out much bouncier from root to ends . Big difference from the very first use. I absolutely love it !
"
"
The only thing worth having to wash and cleanse your hair.
"
"
There is no way this could have been a Devacurl product, I've been using one condition and I love it (as I do all devacurl products) but I ordered this because it is suppose to be more moisturizing...not! This made my hair feel like straw and would not get the tangles out, it didn't even smell anything like devacurl products, I returned the product and will not order from this company ever again!
"
"
item received thank you
"
"
I really wanted to like this product and I'm sorry to say it just doesn't work for me.  Quite frankly, I absolutely hate it and can't wait to be done with it.  My hair feels so dry and is so frizzy which is exactly what I thought this product would prevent.  I suppose I shouldn't have strayed from things that were working for me to begin with.  Lesson learned.  I'm glad other people have found this to be a good product but I was extremely disappointed and will not be purchasing it again!  The first picture (in the tan sweater) is before I used this shampoo.  My curls are tight and smooth the way that I like them.  The second picture(in the blue shirt) is using the shampoo.  My curls are stringy and frizzy!  I will go back to my drug store brand shampoo/conditioner for certain!
"
"
I really wanted to try this. I am a Deva Curl fan and hoped this would be better during the dry winter. Unfortunately, I recieved Deva Curl No-Poo and One Conditions. NOT DECADENCE. I had to return it and then had no shampoo and conditioner. Very disappointing and a waste of time.
"
"
Loved the price on this! Half of the price of the salon and the exact same product!
"
"
Received this product broken and leaking! I won't be ordering from amazon again!
"
"
I love the product, but my No-Poo came open, it was a mess 😞
"
"
Outstanding love it!!!!
"
"
Love this, I usually use Deva Curl No Poo for my super curly hair. This one does wonders for my tiny curls!
"
"
The bottle had a hole on the bottom!!!!!!!! All of the cleanser spilled out!!!
"
"
I ordered this by mistake; I was meaning to order the Decadence conditioner.  I love the Lo poo DevaCurl; I tried this one but it causes buildup on the scalp
"
"
Received product in timely manner but shampoo pump was not on correctly so it leaked all over products. Quite a bit was out of bottle.
"
"
These products are amazing. I have been using DevaCurl products for a year now and nothing else makes my hair feel the way that this does. My wash and gos last for an entire week and it's just awesome. The regular line is nice but the Decadence line is even better!!!!
"
"
***BE AWARE!!!!****I am extremely disappointed with this company! I made sure to read the description along with the questions and reviews before I placed my order. I received my package today only to find that I only received the cleanser and not the DUO as stated on the product title, description and questions! Now I have to make a trip to Ulta just to buy these items when I have to fly out today. They honestly don't even deserve a 1 star!
"
"
Smells like the weird hair products I used growing up that were greasy or thick and never did anything for curls or dry hair. But I've gotten compliments on the smell!! It seems to work just as well as the regular deep condition and no poo for tight curls but those smell better, like lime and stuff. I love Deva curl but this smell reminds me of bad hair times, sorry! Just wanted to be honest and wonder if anyone else had the same Stop correcting ""experience"". Cant describe the smell either. Its not 'botanical' or anything. Overall though, great product really.
"
"
This shampoo is the bomb! I have tried zillions of shampoos to help calm my curly, coarse, frizzy hair. The shop gal told me this has more moisturizing and conditioning than the regular Deva no poo shampoo. She was right. I could tell in the shower there was going to be a difference. I am not exaggerating - my hair feels like silk. You will not be disappointed.
"
"
Originally I received the Devacurl Decadence No-Poo and One condition in a curly hair holiday kit. It was my 1st time trying their products. I definitely love love love the No-poo cleanser. My scalp felt so clean after using this but my hair still felt moisturized, not stripped at all, but not weighed down either as I have fine hair. The One condition from this line is good also. But I don't really care for the smell and after trying the original one condition, I like that one better. It smells like candy but not overpowering and has  more moisture than the Decadence One Condition. It is still a really good product and I will definitely continue to use it in my hair routine. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the smell of the One condition but the No-Poo cleanser smells great.
"
"
I REALLY wanted to like this product, but unfortunately, it's now high on my list of worst products ever used on my natural hair.  I purchased it a couple of months ago, but wanted to finish my other product before trying this.  I have used it twice and it dries my hair out and leaves it very frizzy.  I will not use it again or make another purchase.  Apparently, I've made a $50+ donation.
"
"
I would love to give this 5 stars but unfortunately I can't! This stuff is horrible!!! I thought it would be nourishing and all it did was make my hair feel extra dry. The conditioner was no good either! Anything that makes your fingers or hands feel dry is no good! Not worth the money or the hype ☹️️
"
"
This shampoo is great! I like how it cleans my hair without the lather. If you put a generous amount on your hair and focus on the scalp for about 5 minutes you will notice that the cleaning process is easier. The matching conditioner is great for detangling and if you want to deep condition. I put more on my ends so they can get full moisture without frizzing.
"
"
Ordered the original no poo and got the decadence so gave it a try. Do not like the smell but much worse, it completely dried out my scalp. I started to get dandruff and an itchy scalp. As soon as I switched back to the original, it went away. Nothing decadent about dandruff.
"
"
Tape in hair extensions get quite dry..this product works fantastic on them. No greasy feel or nasty build up. Works great on real hair. Curly Especially
"
"
Tones down frizz and made my hair so soft!!
"
"
awesome!!! I've been using No poo and one condition for years and this stuff is sooo much better! my hair is (finally) quenched! love it!
"
"
Works great, as described.
"
"
It made my hair fall off in chunks!!!
"
"
I just received these, and neither bottle is full.  Is this normal.  I have attached a photo.  Did anyone else's arrive like this?
"
"
You know for the decadence line, I expected more but my hair was reaaaal dry after I washed this stuff. My next wash day is Thursday, so I'm gonna try again but if not I'm returning it.Update: so I used a little bit more and it wasn't as dry but it was still dry. HOWEVER, omg I put my conditioner right after and my hair has never been so soft and easy to detangle in the shower. There was NO dryness everything was just smoooooth.Now let me explain my routine a little. I do not use shampoo, instead I cleanse with apple cider vinegar/water(1/2 of both)/2 drops of peppermint oil. I have a problem scalp and nearly ALL shampoos dry out my scalp and only SOME give my hair the moisture it needs. There has only been one shampoo (Shea Moisture Deep Cleanse) that has delivered both moisture and controlled scalp for me. I do my cleanse twice, to last me 4-5 days (I can probably go longer) then follow up with my conditioner(SM JBCO). When I got this no poo it was my deep conditioning day and my conditioner did not deliver the amount of moisture it usually does which was concerning and seemed obvious to me it was the no poo. I now see that it was simply because I didn't put enough (need at least 25 pumps tbh).Also note I asked Devacurl if Amazon was a Verified Vendor of their products and they said no. This also means the one I've recieved could either be expired/bootleg/watered-down. Sooooo I will be buying the no poo decadence from Deva Curl themselves and see if I get better results.Update: I'm back babies, after having washed my hair twice with the no poo decadence from my local Ulta (veeified vendor). I have noticed, very little difference. I do only use 16-18 pumps with this one though. Could mean I got a watered down one or could mean after using around 36 oz of no poo my hair has become more manageable, which I agree. So I would say user discretion. At Ulta it was around $47.48 (tax included).

This is the absolute BEST for my dry, curly, color-treated hair. I use it year-round -- only occasionally substituting it with an Argan conditioner or deep conditioner -- but it's the best in winter when everything gets really dry. I use a cotton (not terry) hair towel that I purchased here on Amazon to scrunch and pat my hair after using it. I hang my head upside-down and gently pat and scrunch upwards to take the wetness out of my hair. Then, let it air dry with some leave-in conditioner and/or a small amount of Argan oil. I also occasionally put an extra dab of the One Condition in the lengths of my hair after rinsing and gently wringing as a leave-in conditioner. I highly recommend this stuff, especially if you've already used the original One Condition but need a little more moisture. I probably wouldn't recommend this to people with fine hair. It might weigh it down too much. Just remember to use it sparingly. It doesn't take much.
"
"
Although I have wavy, not curly hair, I have enough hair for two heads and there is enough frizz and unruliness to make me want to try something different. I have mostly used shampoos for dry and frizzy hair. They were better than the alternative, but still left me with a lot of extra effort to look presentable. I bought a small bottle of each the cleanser and the conditioner. I first used the cleanser alone and I thought my hair texture (especially around the scalp) improved significantly.However, there is a learning curve with this product: it does not sud because it does not contain surfactants (chemicals that clean by stripping the surface), so this means if you’re used to conventional shampoo, it will be difficult to figure the cleanser distribution over your hair. I have long (below mid back), abundant hair, so I needed a copious amount (“generous” as the label states is a gross understatement).I suspect it will take many uses of this cleanser and the accompanying conditioner to use it to its best advantage but so far I am encouraged by what I am noticing. Frizz is there, but the texture is improving.I liked that the scent is not overpowering.
"

Even as a seasoned CO washer and curly girl, this No-Poo took some adjustment. I've used Deva products in the past and always felt that they dried my hair out more than I liked (and to be fair I like A LOT of slip) so I mainly stayed away from them. But, like so many other sad curly girls, I was forced to experiment with other brands when Tresemme discontinued their Naturals line (why they did that I'll never know, but I *will* hold it against them until the day I die) so I decided to try out Deva's new Decadence line, hoping it would make my hair happier than their ""normal"" line.The first few times I used it I was not impressed. My hair still felt drier than I wanted, but I thought maybe I just needed the matching conditioner - after all, the label does suggest that if your hair is very thirsty, you'll want to follow it up with a conditioner. But I was lazy and didn't want to drop another $20 on a 12 oz bottle of conditioner that I might not even like, so I kept using the No-Poo on its own. Well lo and behold, after about a week of near daily No-Poo washing, my hair actually started to feel soft again!There was definitely an adjustment period, both for my expectations AND for my hair, but I'm quite happy with the No-Poo now. I finally ordered the One Condition Decadence but that's a different review :) If you're not loving the No-Poo, my advice is to: a) keep using it - don't give up on it after one or two washings, b) experiment with not rinsing as thoroughly!!! This made a huge difference for me, c) try a conditioner afterwards (ideally the One Condition, but whatever works for YOU), or d) maybe it truly isn't for you. (Not necessarily in that order!)Hair, and especially curly hair, is a finicky thing!
"
"
This was absolutely NOT Deva Curl in the bottle.  The No-Poo May have been, but the One Condition smelled like alcohol or another chemical.  Hoping it did not damage my hair.  I washed it out as soon as I noticed something didn’t smell right, but broke out itching anywhere it touched.  I guess they were hoping I didn’t notice after smelling the No-Poo. I ignored reviews about it not being authentic assuming it was people from Deva Curl trying to deter people from buying it elsewhere, but I can say now they were right.  So disappointed.
"
"
Bought this product as my wife and I both use it. Her hair is thick and curly. We were buying the original Deva Curl but this one has a better smell than the original and not so strong. My wife also said it worked better for her than the original. Will buy this product again.
"
"
My hair feels great after using this and the conditioner straight out of the shower.  Even before applying any products after washing my hair got more curl definition ad less frizz than with other products like SheaMoisture and Aunt Carols Daughter.  It also doesn't leave my hair feeling dehydrated after washing and air drying so I can wash it more often which is nice since I work in manufacturing and can sweat a lot.
"
"
I've used sulfate-free shampoos before, but as soon as you apply this, you know it's different. It doesn't ""lather"" when you apply it and you use the water to move the product throughout your hair. The most amazing thing about this product is that it doesn't feel like it's stripping your hair. After rinsing, my hair felt more moisturized and softer than before I started. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars for me, is that I don't feel my hair is completely clean, but I have incredibly thick hair and I may not be using it 100% correctly. Love the product overall!
"
"
Switching to a sulfate-free and silicone free routine has completely transformed my hair into defined curls instead of just a frizzy mess.  I use decadence no poo and conditioner with the ultra defining gel and once a week I deep condition.  I would recommend looking up the curly girl method for styling tips or going to a curly hair salon for a tutorial as its how we use the products that make or break the results.
"
"
I really like this product. it is creamy, glides through hair easily, smells great, and really leaves my hair clean without drying it out like regular shampoo. I was instructed by my stylist to apply it and wash my scalp, then just run my fingers through my hair so not to tangle up my curls and rinse. It works great. Of course, I still must condition after.
"
"
I have been trying the CG method for over a year but had minimal results. My hair has been more manageable but my curl had not returned. After doing some research I discovered I have low porosity hair. This was a recommended product for low porosity hair and I have definitely noticed a difference. After three months of using this I actually was able to let my hair air dry and leave the house! No curling needed!
"
"
It took me some time to figure out what was making mine and my daughters hair so unmanageable and finally I realized this was NOT the real thing. At first I was hmm this smells different. I blamed the heat and summer fun and finally I realized this was not my beloved Deva Curl. Please skip this vendor.
"
"
I was very hesitant to switch away from the original No-Poo cleanser since I had been using it for over 7 years or so, but I was unable to find the 1 liter bottle available.  I have no regrets at all!  This cleanser has a much milder fragrance than the original no-poo.  It leaves my hair feeling very soft and moisturized.  My hair is fine, and it did not weigh it down for me.  I will be sticking with this cleanser from now on.
"
"
I have fizzy curly hair. I went on a mission to see if I could find a product that would allow me to just air dry naturally and not be a slave to the flat iron on weekends. DevaCurl products are amazing and worth all the hype. They left my hair frizz free and crunch free which I never thought was possible.
"
"
My hair is so soft and the curl is bouncy and almost frizz free! I've been using the Deva shampoo/conditioner for years but this is my first time using the new decadence formula. I will never go back! I love it!
"
"
The item arrived open with the pump cap unscrewed and about a quarter of the product spilled out into the plastic bag. :-(Thankfully its cream and not liquid, and the entire contents didn't spill.  I will still try to contact seller.Other than that, the product is great! I've been using it almost two years on my color treated hair. Hair definitely feels less dry than with detergent shampoo.
"
"
I don’t even wanna give this one star! Reading the reviews i was hesitant on buying these but i did anyway, HUGE mistake. these products must be expired or watered down... i compared smell to my other bottles & it smelled the same and the consistency was the same. But when rinsing out of my hair my hair was a GIANT frizz ball and i’ve used deva curl for the past 3 years i’ve never gotten these results. I put a deep conditioner in my hair and i will sleep with it in tonight hopefully my hair isn’t frizzy when i rinse it out! don’t buy. just buy from ulta.
"
"
This is great for dry hair even if it’s fine- makes my daughters hair so beautiful - I don’t rinse it out only put it on her ends and it keeps her curls in tact! The line is great- I use it on my hair too- but it’s better on her curly fine hair- and I use it every day and only wash 2 times a week with the low poo or no poo- great product for mixed hair
"
"
This is not real devacurl. I purchased from the ctual devacurl website and then purchased from here. The smells are much lighter from this seller than they are from devacurl. The first purchase I made from this seller seemed great but then they start replacing the good stuff with the bad. If you have curly hair always buy from devacurl so you KNOW the product is real!
"
"
I can not get enough of the DevaCurl Decadence line. I love this line so much more than the original. It has helped my hair bounce back and my hair looks so much healthier now since I've switched. I will say the No-Poo and Conditioner feels thin in consistency, but they both have great slip. The No-Poo also cleanses my hair without stripping it. I use these products 1-2 times a week, depending on the weather / scalp needs.
"
"
This Deva Curl No Poo Cleanser is amazing!  I love it  I love that I am not putting harsh things on my hair and it is still clean!!  I personally don't even need a conditioner because the cleanser also conditions my hair.  If I just scrunch it in, my hair has a nice curl to it.  This has a very nice smell of peppermint.  Overall, I am very impressed with it and have used nothing besides this since I bought it!  Very happy with it!!
"
"
I have been using deva curl products for the last 8 years because it makes my curls less frizzy and keeps my curls defined longer than other brands. It smells good and makes my hair feel great with a lot of harsh chemicals! I love that I don't always have to use a conditioner with this specific product!
"
"
Love this product! I have been using this product for almost a year and I noticed a huge difference in the texture of my hair. Less frizz and more definition! At first it was interesting that the shampoo doesn't lather but now I love how it helps keep things from getting tangled. I hate putting chemicals in my hair and this provides just that!
"
"
I LOVE this set. I have 4a/4b hair and after using these products I have less frizz and more defined curls. I detangled and styled with my Denman brush, and I love the results. To make these products ""work"" for you, you have to find the right combo of products. I would suggest trying other products in the line. The scarf is HUGE. Very pretty and very soft! It didn't fall off my head while sleeping on a satin pillowcase. I will be ordering this set again! (My items arrived arrived wrapped in plastic inside a bubble mailer. At first I was disappointed because it looked like it could easily spill out, but I was pleasantly surprised as to how in tact everything was!)
"
"
Found this product in Ulta and then did some research. All the reviews were good so I bought the .No Poo shampoo and One Conditioner. So far it has really helped me keep my hair softer and not so frizzy.  Definitely get a micro fiber towel to dry your hair after washing - it also helps with the frizz.  I never use a regular towel anymore.
"
"
I love the product, and nice it came in a large size. My packaging was iffy, the bottles had condition wasted in it but after rinsing off neither bottle was broken. Not sure where it came from. Will order again.
"
"
This shampoo is excellent for curly hair!!! When used with other products it works really well!!! I suggest the shampoo, conditioner, the foam, the gel and the B'Leave In!!! You'll love your curly/wavy hair again!!!I went to a new salon and they recommended this shampoo...I purchased it there in an 8oz bottle for $20!!!!SAY NO MORE!!!!Rosie M. (wife of Brandon M.)
"
"
Came quick ! Love it I have been using DevaCurl hair products for a year now and will not put anything els in my hair .... my hair has literally grown from right below my shoulders to my hip in a matter of a year...! I have always had trouble growing it but since I have been taking care of it , no dying no using heat and using good hair products I'm stunned :)
"
"
I will never use anything else but Devacurl for my curlies...I'm religious on the curly girl method. The decadence line is way more nourishing and this combo pack price is a steal! Do yourself a favor and YouTube curly girl method to get the best results from these products, you will not be disappointed!
"
"
I've stood by this shampoo for a couple years now and it hasn't failed me yet! The coconut version is new, I got it because it was cheaper than the older, non-coconut version in the same size, and it was pretty much exactly the same. Feels good, smells nice, keeps my hair clean without stripping it of all the oils it needs to be healthy and stay in nice curls. Would recommend, especially if you have curly hair!
"
"
The conditioner works nice but the shampoo was not all that. The hair didn't really feel clean. I wouldn't suggest it, not worth the price.
"
"
Like a watered down WEN, my hair is dried out!  I bought this thinking it was half price of WEN.  Now I had to order the WEN, thick creamy conditioner.  It has watered down, thin conditioning treatment.  Curls are ok.
"
"
I have soft and fine curls and have been using Deva No Poo for quite a while very successfully. Not only does it cleanse my hair well, but it also nicely softens it so I don't need to use conditioner.Based on predominantly good comments on Amazon of Decadence line I purchased No Poo Decadence and have to say that it is nowhere near the quality of the original No Poo. Wish I didn't spend money on it. Will go back to the original product.
"
"
Excellent products for those with extra curly hair.  This brand has varying products for different types of hair, from wavy to very curly.  Makes stubborn curls behave and leaves hair healthy looking and conditioned. The price point was excellent as well.The products arrived on time with no damage.  Very pleased and will be ordering again.
"
"
Love the decadence for my 2B/C 3A curls. Doesn't weigh my hair down, but keeps it from getting tacky.The bottles I received had the cream spilled out of the pump part of both bottles, so shipment could be better
"
"
This was a life saver for my daughter(and me). I know longer have to hear that she hates her hair. She has very thick, coarse curly hair. It is so worth every penny. Her hair looks great. Will buy again. Plz don't ever stop making this stuff. The entire line is amazing
"
"
My hair isn't curly but bought the small bottle of this on a recommendation from a friend.  It makes my hair soft and  so far helps keep my color awesome looking!  Have only used it a couple of times but so far I love it!
"
"
I often order the no-poo and conditioner at the same time. No problem with the no-poo but this last shipment the conditioner arrived with a funky smell. I think it must be old because I had an old travel sized one I had stored away and when I used it it had the same rancid smell as my recent shipment via Amazon. Not sure how to tell where it was shipped from but now I’m leery to order it again.
"
"
Glad I bought it! It works better on my curls than the regular Devacurl No-Poo. I don't even need to use the Devacurl conditioner because it's so creamy that it cleans and moisturizes my hair all in one. Will not go back to the regular Devacurl No-Poo.
"
"
It took me a while to break down and get into this shampoo, but I cannot see myself going back. It makes a huge difference in my hair texture and curl formation.  I love it more every time I use it.
"
"
Love this one!  It is even better for my hair than the original!  Smoother and less frizz.  My hair is so soft and I am so glad I tried it!  I will order more.
"
"
My absolute favorite shampoo! I'm a product junkie so you can only imagine how many shampoos i've tired. I always tend to get organic products because my curly hair is already extremely dry so I try to avoid all the chemicals. This is the only cleanser I've used that doesn't dry my hair and you can instantly feel how smooth your hair gets when you rinse it out. Will definitely repurchase!
"
"
I always use Deva Curl but my hair was a little dry and when I used the decadence shampoo and conditioner I didn't like it. This time I used the shampoo and then the  regular Deva one conditioner- perfect combo!
"
"
Not at all like previous formula. Hair was dry and breaking after less than a week. Bought up all I could of previous formula (deva care no poo and deva care one conditioner) and hope they go back before I run out.
"
"
I first bought this to try since I had hair oil stains on my pillow. This product eliminated this for me. I have bought this exclusively for over a year. I am highly satisfied.
"
"
My hair is more dry and coarse after using this. Really disappointed because it's stupidly expensive. Going back to drug store co-wash.
"
"
Made my curls 10x better and I was using Mixed Chicks products before this. I used both products with the Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner for shiny defined curls (3b/3c hair) that lasted me the whole week before I need to wash again. Worth the price.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl products for a while now and love them but I do not care for the Decadence product.  It has left my hair flat.  I typically have wavy hair that I blow dry with a diffuser and with the regular Deva Curl I comes out curly, the Decadence product has been leaving it too flat and it's barely wavy.  Seeing these products cost a lot, it's usually worth it, but now I'm out $64.00 and will have to go back and order the regular.
"
"
Decadence is giving this white girl with short curly hair the moisture her hair has been craving. I ,have been using most of the Deva line product for several years but what a difference the Decadence is making.  I want to stress I do have short hair, usually between ear and chin length, and I am a white female.  The only reason why I stress this is because I read and read reviews and did not find one from anyone like me.  I also watched videos and did not find any like me for Decadence.  All though, I learned a LOT from all the reviews and tons from the videos and thank all of you-I have changed some of my process's due to your great input!
"
"
I love DevaCurl products - they have totally transformed my wavy/frizzy hair into beautiful soft wavy curls. Using the DevaCurl method, not only does my hair look better, but it has grown more in the last six months of using the product than in the last six years of trying to grow out my hair. My hair no longer breaks with brushing (since I no longer brush but instead use my fingers and wide comb if necessary in the shower.)My one-star review is not for the product, but for the seller. As another buyer indicated, they received only one bottle, not the ""duo"" as stated in the advertisement. I recommend buying from another Amazon seller, an Ulta Beauty supply, or your local Deva Curl salon.  The seller claimed they could not find my order number, so Amazon will have to take the hit for my product return rather than the shady seller.
"
"
I've been using Deva products for awhile but wander away occasionally because I didn't like the smell of the original. These smell good AND are so moisturizing for my 3b and c curls. I'm totally in love and will stick to this rather than wandering again
"
"
Just another mediocre shampoo, but without suphates. Save your money. I mixed this product with my regular shampoo.
"
"
Holy grail for moisturizing curly hair. Recommend to keep your curly semi coarse hair curly and moisturizerized.
"
"
I have been using these products every other week since my October purchase.  I have two years of cozily 4a curl growth, am 51 , and have about 5% greying hair.  I have notice substantial moisture retention and strength in my hair.  I use the styling cream from the same line, and I finally have curl definition that shows the beauty of my coils.  I have been on a healthy hair growth journey for close to four years.  I have used lots of products in my lifetime, and I have found these products, along with two other ones, that will help my hair thrive in good health.
"
"
It does what it says it good for curly hair I just wish it wasn’t so expensive.
"
"
I read several reviews on this and am glad I tried it!  I've been using it for several months and even though it doesn't lather and gets my hair clean and soft.
"
"
I don't think this is the real deal. I've bought directly from Deva and when I bought from this seller I did not get good results. My hair is always frizzy and is not hydrated. The seller must have tampered with the original product. I would not recommend it.
"
"
Update- I have a friend that loves this product. She was disappointed with my review of it. She told me to watch the You tube video of how to use it. I thought she was crazy. But, I humored her and watched the video. She also gave me her devacurl styling product. BIG difference. I always scrunch my hair when I'm done conditioning- but the staying cream seriously is the kicker with this. My curls are defined but not crispy at all. Just defined curls. If you buy this shampoo and conditioner spend the extra $15 to get the cream or the gel. I'm telling you, it makes a difference. I canceled my return on this product.This is not a good product. I have very curly hair and it has made it more frizzy than ever. It's basically like washing your hair with cheap body lotion. It doesn't smell very good and isn't worth the money at all. I'm in the process of returning it.
"
"
Deva Curl is the only product I use in my hair.  It makes my hair shiny and bouncy and is not out of control.  Love Love Love this product.  buying on Amazon is cheaper than in the store.
"
"
Great product. Imagine that shampooing your hair won’t suds? Sounded weird to me too until I tried it. My hair just loves the stuff. Must have for curly girls.
"
"
My son has used the original version for over two years. I thought this formula would give some added benefits however it left a filmy residue on his hair and scalp.
"
"
This is a great Curly Girl Method product. I use it in lieu of conditioner when “co-washing.” Then I use leave in conditioner and gel once I get out of the shower.
"
"
I'm a long time DevaCurl user with thick, 3c curls.  I decided to try this new decadence line and prefer this conditioner to the original.  Worth a try if you are already a fan of One Condition.  It does seem a bit heavier, so it may not be as desirable for anyone using it as a leave-in whose hair goes limp with a heavy product.
"
"
The DevaCurl organic shampoo leaves my hair soft, healthy and manageable.  It encourages growth and curl without frizziness.Get used to no ""suds"" from the No Poo Shampoo! It is a good thing.
"
"
I've used Wen & Hair One, and love this one most of all.  Really leaves your hair soft and shiny.  My friends who switched from Wen & Hair One loved it better too.
"
"
Even though I have short hair and wash it every day. I feel I need to wash it twice. I am not used to the shampoos that don't lather. But without washing it twice, it does not feel clean The condition seems to work well. One pump is sufficient for my hair. The products do leave my hair curly!
"
"
I received this product broken..and half leaked..
"
"
it has made my son's hair very manegeable. i love it. i hate that the price goes up and down but i will wait till it goes back down to stock up. a must have
"
"
I love this product but the packaging was so poor about a quarter of it had spilled out before I opened it. I was so desperate since I had run out that I kept it anyway. Otherwise, this is an amazing product, highly recommend for curly hair gals.
"
"
The shampoo is so thick I can't pump it out of the container. I'm not sure if that means it's a fake but I won't order again.
"
"
Great for curly hair. Someone gave a small bottle to my daughter and now it's all she will use.
"
"
This works great on my 3c hair I was reluctant to try it. Since I've heard the reviews on the other deva curl line that it didn't work to good on 3c hair nor 4a or any other tighter curl pattern. But they came out with one for super curly hair and it works amazing!
"
"
Just know that this is great stuff. So good, that you can FINGER DETANGLE with the cleanser in itself it’s so moisturizing and defines your hair so beautifully.. have to love devacurl !!!!
"
"
I know this product is aimed at curly girls, but I have straight and fine hair that is damaged, and this is a good, gentle cleanser that won't strip your hair and make it feel dry. I have an oily scalp, but my ends get dry. This is perfect, doesn't strip my ends and my scalp feels clean and oil-free for the next two days
"
"
I only use deva products on my curly hair. Been using these products for years. Tried and true, and keeps the frizz away!
"
"
i still have it but when i opened the box there was product  in the box
"
"
I have curly hair and this is my go-to shampoo. I try others, and always circle back to no poo. I'm not sure I notice much difference between decadence and the original.  It's a bit thicker and  may control frizz a bit better.
"
"
I started Deva Curl about 4 months ago and I will not go back to regular shampoo.  I'm very pleased with this product.
"
"
It's okay. This formula for the shampoo feels like it is drying to me.I like the conditioner but would not buy this formula again. I'm going back to the original. It makes my hair feel moisturized and soft.
"
"
My bottles weren't all the way full and my hair came out frizzy after my first wash. Is it possible this isn't the authentic product?
"
"
This a a great price for this product. It smells great and it works great as well.
"
"
Love all deva curl products. This one is lighter than the original formula and I'm super happy with it
"
"
I was a customer at www.birodominicansalon.com and Rosa Monroy, Owner/Manager of the salon used these two products on my hair. The results are excellent. These products changed the texture of my hair so now my hair is soft, has moisture, shine and my scalp is healthy. If you have sensitive skin and you are allergic to a majority of hair products, this is the product line for you.  Also purchase Deva Curl Super Cream Coconut Curl Styler for daily maintenance. IMPORTANT: This product's fragrance DOES NOT have that annoying/gagging coconut smell, it just has a slight hint of coconut fragrance.  These products are safe and they do exactly what they say they will do. You will be extremely surprised and happy with the results.  This company is fantastic! My order arrived 5 days earlier than the expected date of delivery.
"
"
I thought I wouldn't like this but it actually cleans my hair very good and I have very I mean very bad dandruff ...I also use the build up buster time to time both amazing
"
"
Smells good and my curl shape is more defined. The conditioner came with some product leaked out.
"
"
Hands down my favorite and so glad I can buy it on here
"
"
Just got my package in the mail but instead of 1 no poo & 1 one condition I got 2 bottles of one condition. I'll keep them though because I use deva products exclusively.
"
"
This is bar none #1 for me!
"
"
Strange that it doesn't lather but my scalp always feels clean and it definitly doesn't strip my hair so I really like this product.
"
"
I've been buying these for years and couldn't be happier! Love them and they keep my hair clean and softer than any other product, especially for curly hair!
"
"
Love this stuff for my fine, curly, frizzy hair!!!
"
"
These are the best shampoo and conditioned for my naturally curly 3c/4a hair
"
"
this cannot be the real product. it made my scalp itch so bad it burned (there was no dandruff). and it made my shoulders break out. don't get bamboozled.
"
"
Love these products for my coarse wild hair
"
"
Good
"
"
I love Deva Curl products. I quit using shampoo a year or so ago and my hair feels much better. I like the smell and my hair does seem to stay clean
"
"
My fav product and it really helped bring out my curls
"
"
Smells wonderful. Im still trying to figure out how to use them. Sometimes its moisturizes my hair and other times my hair feels dry after using it. Its the strangest thing...
"
"
I received the product quickly, however, I just realized I don't think it's the actual DevaCurl product. It doesn't smell right and my hair is reacting badly to it.
"
"
On our reorder list so a decent product. Price is too high so a star off for that.
"
"
Awesome product
"
"
Not as moisturizing as promised, wife slightly disappointed with performance of this expensive duo
"
"
My daughter loves this product for holding her curls and retaining rings.

Been using this product a few years for my curly hair and it works great to not strip the natural oils out of my hair!
"
"
I have been a longtime Deva Curl user and have always purchased my products through a salon - and never been disappointed. After seeing all the wonderful reviews here, I decided to order this for the convenience of it and am sorely disappointed. After using this and One Condition Decadence for about 4 weeks, my hair turned dry and brittle. Nothing else changed in my routine other than using this. I kept using them hoping things would get better but they never did. I have since gone back to my salon and purchased product from them and my hair is once again soft and manageable. My stylist said to beware buying these products from non-authorized sellers as the products can be diluted or can be old. I called Deva Curl directly and they confirmed that only authorized sellers have guaranteed products. That means I'm out some cash and just threw away more than half-filled bottles.  :(

This is the only conditioner I use on my fine, thick curly hair. DevaCurl fan for life!
"
"
Works for my beautiful medium thick wavy hair!
"
"
I perfer the shampoos that are low poo, not no poo. Conditioner is great.
"
"
The No Poo is perfect for my curly hair! It leaves it soft and residue-free!
"
"
I have been using their products for a couple of years and love them
"
"
Great value and much more affordable than buying the smaller size bottles. I use these products with the Arc Angel gel.
"
"
makes a huge difference between being a frizz head and having hair people compliment
"
"
After using the original DevaCurl, I actually prefer this formula. It leaves my curls looking more defined. I also love the smell, and have received many compliments.
"
"
Thicker than the original. Smells better too.
"
"
Great results
"
"
Must have for every natural.  Really cleans my hair and add pop to my curls.  3c/41 hair
"
"
Did not at all clean hair!
"
"
Love this product. Not to heavy for my dry curly hair. It curls after washing every time with it without other products.
"
"
Like i said this product is awesome it makes my super soft and I love the way it feel on my hair..
"
"
I've just started may natural hair journey, but so far, considering my sensitive skin, I haven't have any issue with this wash.
"
"
Very nice non sulphide shampoo.  Gentle on hair and scalp.
"
"
I love the DEVA PRODUCTS.Your Hair feels so good with them being sulphate-free.
"
"
It works but its a super thin consistency. Not thick or mosturizing to me.
"
"
Love love these products!!!! Thx u
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Keeps hair soft and healthy, but if you work out often you may need to wash your hair everyday.
"
"
Made my curls, pop !Formula smells great too.Great price for the duo
"
"
Yep.  My everyday scalp cleanse.  Perfect for my fine, curly hair.  Love it.
"
"
I will never ever use any other shampoo again. This stuff makes my hair so healthy and soft. I love it!
"
"
terrible it dried out my daughters hair so bad
"
"
I have used Deva products for several years.  This new line is wonderful.  My hair feels softer but I have great curls!
"
"
Love love this for us curly girls! This is none drying and my have has an amazing shine after!
"
"
Great for curly hair!
"
"
I wish this stuff was cheaper.  But my woman loves it
"
"
Perfect for my thirsty curls! These products have completely changed the game for my hair.
"
"
Great product 👍🏽
"
"
LOVE this for my permed hair... my hair and scalp feel clean afterwards. This line helps keep my perm last for a very long time
"
"
Awesome product for an awesome price!  I love this Shampoo and Conditioner pair and I highly recommend them.
"
"
Id drink this stuff if i could. It's the only thing that works this well for my curls, especially since I've started highlighting them. the whole devacurl line conditions super well and leaves them feeling great.
"
"
Absolutely love this
"
"
My daughter loves these products for her curls. Amazon has the best prices on devacurl products.
"
"
The best Conditioner!
"
"
If you like diva curl - this price can’t be beat.
"
"
great product
"
"
Have been using this priduct for awhile. Its excellent for curly hair.
"
"
Great shampoo, no lather so takes some getting used to but smells good and leaves hair nice.
"
"
Excellent product for curly hair. My hair loves and shows improvement, body and shine when I use this
"
"
Love all Deva curl products. They keep my my hair tangle free and frizz free.
"
"
nice and light... love it
"
"
This is the best shampoo for curly hair. Won't use anything else.
"
"
PERFECT.
"
"
My hair is in love with this stuff. No more thirsty curls !
"
"
Doesn't smell as great as the original Deva curl line. Definitely worth using as it seals in moisture to strengthen hair.
"
"
The product is great but the bottle came with a defective pump.I have used the product for years and swear by it. It has made my curls silky, bouncy, and tame.
"
"
Does a great job
"
"
Love this shampoo.  Wish it had come as a shampoo/conditioner pack and not just two shampoos.  Much better price than in the store.
"
"
I love Devacurl products and was so happy to find this amazing deal!!Everything came on time and the price was unbeatable!
"
"
Love this product - helps keep the frizz in control on my curly hair.
"
"
Beats the Salon price.
"
"
Git what I wanted at a good price and came fast.
"
"
Love these products!!Helps my curls stay calm.
"
"
Love it.  Leaves my hair feeling cleaning and soft.
"
"
My daughter's hair is a work in progress
"
"
They do a gret job sealing this so nothing spills! Thank you!
"
"
Love how great it works for my family's hair and scalp health
"
"
My hair loves it
"
"
Love it. Smells great my hair feels hydrated and soft
"
"
This is a great product, the whole line works really well with my 3c-4a curls.
"
"
I love products from DevaCurl - they really do work for naturally curly hair. This no-poo is a bit more rich than the regular no-poo which is great with the drier winter months. Great smell and works wonderfully.
"
"
I have very thick, coarse, wiry hair and this stuff makes my hair behave.
"
"
Its DevaCurl so you already know it's going to be good.
"
"
Wonderful!! Frizz free curlsss
"
"
Love deva care products
"
"
I've been using these shampoos and conditioners for a cpl years now and I love them.
"
"
great product but does not work well with my hair. I like the original one better
"
"
I love, Love, Love Deva Curl.  Best product line I have ever used on my curly hair!
"
"
Great Product, Highly Recommended.
"
"
Daughter swears by it!
"
"
I can totally see the difference between my curls before and after the use of the product. My curls are coming back to life.
"
"
Great product, would definitely recommend it.  Can't beat the price here.
"
"
Great for curly hair! Very moisturizing!
"
"
Love it
"
"
I have dry hair and this was perfect for me
"
"
nothing like the original no poo which was great.  This dries my curly hair out.  My hairdresser told me to stop using it immediately.  I loved the old formula.  This is a thin watered down feeling shampoo and conditioner.  I threw it out.  I loved Deva curl in past, but now moved on to other lines.  If you are a Deva curl fan stick to the original formula.  My hair is thick, naturally curly, color treated.
"
"
I was hesitant to try this version because, let’s face it, a shampoo that has milk in the name sounds weird, but it was a few bucks cheaper when I was replenishing my bottle.  L This is just as great as the original No Poo with the benefit of being more hydrating!  It  has a light coconut smell and while I’m not a fan of coconut scents it’s so mild it doesn’t bother me at all which makes it a winner.  I love the larger bottles with the pump, so much more convenient.  It sounds silly but after having these pump bottles for years, I don’t think I could go back to a smaller bottle that I have to pick up and squeeze, too much work! 😂. Another win for the Deva line!
"
"
LOVE
"
"
The only thing found to work on this head of curly hair.
"
"
DevaCurl makes great products that work well together and with other brands.
"
"
Best detangler. I have never used better prod it's and I have African dry curly hair.
"
"
Love this stuff for my curly hair!
"
"
Works fabulous
"
"
It's a good product but not for my hair. Unfortunately I found out after spending that much money on it.
"
"
My hairdresser recommended the Deva product line for my curly hair.  I went to Ulta and bought small bottles that were very expensive, but I love the product.  I later found that I can order from Amazon - wish I'd checked here first!
"
"
The only shampoo and conditioner I will use! Works great on curly hair, Doesn't dry out your hair so your curls stay curls and won't turn into frizz!!
"
"
I like DevaCare line MUCH better. Missing it SO VERY MUCH!
"
"
Amazing!
"
"
Great product.  Awesome promotional price.
"
"
Love this new version of No-Poo!
"
"
Hair looked great with defined curls very dry afterwards
"
"
It needed to be exactly what it said, and it was.
"
"
Love my deva curl products!
"
"
Love the product! Great price! Packaged well.
"
"
Love this conditioner💚
"
"
This is the best product i have used for my hair curl.
"
"
One of the only shampoos that can soften my coarse locks!
"
"
Gave as gift to a curly curler. She lives it.
"
"
The real deal!
"
"
Love this  product
"
"
Love it
"
"
My twist out last for DAYS now! Great Product!
"
"
Great shampoo.
"
"
It was perfect and a great deal.
"
"
Fast shipping, exactly as advertised. Will re-order.
"
"
Deva Curl never fails! Love this!!
"
"
I'm in love
"
"
Excellent ❤️
"
"
love This!
"

I am Egyptian, so I have African hair. My curls are a mix of wavy and tight corkscrew and I was introduced to this product line by a curly hair stylist. It works wonders in my hair. Before my hair was always dry and frizzy and my curls were unmanageable. I have tried several products that were ok but now my hair is soft and bouncy with minimal frizz. Have been using this shampoo along with the Decadence conditioner and the Super cream for 5 months now and I always order them from Amazon because they are cheaper here. I don't go through the shampoo as fast as the conditioner because I only shampoo my hair once a week although my stylist advised that this shampoo is very gentle and suitable for everyday use.
"
"
the perfect amount of moisture for my hair! lovely smell at first but not after a few days, which is a bummer, because with this no poo i really don't have to clean my hair for about 3-4 days.
"
"
I have been using Deva products for years, and I like this new addition to their product line.
"
"
I love these products. They are all i use. But i ordered the no poo shampoo and received the decadence conditioner. Wondered why my hair smelled dirty the day after i washed it? Cause i didn’t.
"
"
I like this better than the original...better for dry hair and I prefer the scent of this to the original, too!
"
"
No poo Decadence has an earthy/musk Dax pomade or old school insence fragrance. The scent lingers for the day. I felt nauseated after every time I used it. The contents are very thick. It does not rinse clean with a moisturized feel. After rinsing I feel as if I need to wash my hair with shampoo.  It causes shedding and itching. This is not an improvement from the original formula which I love. I have used 1/4 of the bottle of NPD and I finally realize I need to pass it on to someone else so may wish to try it. Between the scent, itchiness and shedding I am compelled to give the product a HARD PASS. The original has always worked and I will stick with it. One star for the product. The scent and the packaging/marketing alone this product seems to be geared towards African Americam hair (3b/c) which I am and have is off putting. It doesn't need to smell like that and AA hair is much more fragile than other hair types so what ever Deva has added to their formula is not only pointless but harmful.5 stars for the seller because they did package it well and it did arrive on time.
"
"
blah.  going back to my old shampoo. . .my old shampoo is an actual shampoo and my hair still feels softer after using it than when i use this no-poo.
"
"
Love it on my hair.  Will definately purchase again.
"
"
Gentle on hair & scalp. I use everyday.
"
"
I haven't washed my hair with anything else after receiving this. It has been miraculous in maintaining the color of my hair and the curl! Fantastic!
"
"
This provides great moisturizer for curly hair! I love this product.
"
"
Works like the original but the Smell is terrible on this one. I am going back to the original
"
"
Paid for decadence and got the regular no poo.  Beware
"
"
Ordered the decadence got regular. It was a waste of my time and money.
"
"
Love it
"
"
I seem to be allergic to this product.
"
"
Let me start by saying I have been using the OG No Poo & One Condition for 10 years now and I LOVE them .... I am always excited to try a new curly hair product as my hairs' needs change from time to time ..... so when I got the email form Deva Curl announcing their new product I thought Oh great sign me up.  I figured this would be a great addition to curly girl hair repertoire on the days my hair was feeling dry .... well here is the thing the fragrance is a DEAL BREAKER.  I have been using this for a month and I can barely bring myself to open the bottle and put this on my hair.  It's like when you go to the movies and somebody wearing poison or obsession or some other really potent perfume sits by you and you can not escape.... only its your own hair that you cant escape!!! That is what I love about the original it is NOT smelly at all!!  I am very sensitive to perfume in products and for that reason alone I give this a big thumbs down...  (Side note ....The conditioner does not have such a strong smell ... )
"
"
The bottles leaked all over the box that they came in. Still usable, but as other DevaCurl product users probably understand, I treat this stuff like gold since it's so expensive and works so well. Very disappointed in the packaging, and sorry to waste the good 1/4 cup of product spilled at the bottom of the box.
"
"
Do not buy this. This is not Deva Curl. I opened it and smelt coconut which I have never experienced with devacurl but I just thought it was something new. I then used it and I knew that this was fake and filled with something else. Returning immediately
"
"
This is my favorite no poo/co wash. I previously was using the Eden coconut co-wash, which I love, but I was buying like 3 jars at a time because I wash often and have thick hair. The jar isn't the most convenient either. When I found this jumbo size noo-poo I thought it would be perfect and very practical. I have really thick hair and it can swallow product up. I can use 2-3 pumps to coat my hair. It is very gentle yet gets my hair super clean with out stripping ANY moisture. This will last me a few months. I have type 4 a/b hair and it penetrates deep down to moisturize my curls and really add definition.
"
"
I purchased the Decadence no poo and condition from my stylist.  I used it for the first time this morning.  I was leary as I have not had good luck with other no poo products leaving my limp, oily and dull.  I have to say I did not mind the smell of the no poo at all, it is light and pleasant and wore off after an hour ( at least I don't smell it any longer). I have 2A waves that pull out and hang if I don't have a good product, and I have to say I am pleased on day 1!
"
"
I don't know about this seller, but the devacurl no poo and conditioner has made my hair fall out by the handfuls stay away from this product . It happens gradually, now my hair just falls out in wads while I am taking a shower.
"
"
Love this!! It's everything it said it would be and was packaged great. I will be buying it again next time I'm out. It's the best product out there for curly hair. I have tried so many different kinds and this is truly the best there is for curly hair!!!
"
"
I thought this was an improved version of the original and wanted to try it. I don't like it at all and its frankly hard for me to believe it's Deva Curl. That wonderful fresh, earthy and organic scent is replaced by a sugar sweet, cotton candy coconut fragrance. Not for me. And worse, my hair was weighted down by it. Foolish that I bought the 32oz size assuming I would love them. This is a big disappointment. Back to the original for me.
"
"
So moisturizing for my natural 4b hair! It has replaced my weekly shampoo (I only use 1x month).Update Feb 2016:Not sure if I would buy this from Amazon. The one I bought from here is making my hair fall out ALOT. The one I bought from Ulta doesnt do this...
"
"
I have very think DENSE hair in transition and even a lovely as this product is...still no enough moisture!  My curls DRINK IT UP!
"
"
Love, Love, LOVE this product! Well worth every penny! My curls are so much more defined and my hair so much healthier feeling. I am a HUGE fan!
"
"
December 2015:I just received this in the mail.  I have not used it yet.  I will return after I use it to let you all know if I liked it.  My hair type is 2C-3C.February 2016:  I used this product at least 4 times.  I hate it.  The first day it's really pretty and curly; however the second day on my hair is messed up!  I will never purchase this product again.
"
"
I purchased this from Deva Curl website and used it 4 times and it does nothing for my hair.  Day one my hair is really pretty, day 2 on my hair is really messed up, frizzy and very dry!  I really don't like it.  After I finish using this product I will not buy it again.  I am a Natural with 2C-3C type hair!  Completely not satisfied.
"
"
You can go through a lot of products as a curl haired human. This particular line is my favorite and if I've got the money, will always be my first pick. My hair is always in need of moisture and is sensitive to protein. I have never had an issue with the quality or results. I still recommend starting with a trial size if you're not sure.I know I like the brand, so I invest in these bigger bottles.
"
"
I absolutely love this product and have used it for years. But the shipping and packaging was ridiculous. The box was far too small for the product and broke the seal on my conditioner.. it shouldn’t be too much to ask for a product that not damaged.
"
"
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. I have gotten this product from Amazon for over five years and it has worked great, and this is the first time I received a watered down product. It’s literally white water. This is not Set It Free. The real deal is much thicker consistency. I am so angry.
"
"
I love Set it Free. It keeps my curls in check without making my hair hard or ""crunchy"".  I use it after I dry my hair as a kind of ""hair spray"". I've also used it while my hair is wet, but if you do that, your hair will get a little hard/crunchy.The bottle is a good size and the sprayer works well, so you don't have to pump it too many times to get decent coverage.I've used this spray when I wake up, but don't want to wash my hair. We all know what curly hair can look like when we wake up....and this product will help bring curls back to life and reduce the mad scientist look that I wake up with.Some local salons sell this product, but it is much more expensive to purchase at a salon. Save yourself some money and buy it on Amazon!
"
"
I've been trying different products on my 3 or 4 day curls and this works pretty good to re-define them without being sticky.  Let it dry and scrunch.  I love most of the Deva Curl products.
"
"
Use just a little bit of spray on the middle to bottom of damp hair, then scrunch up from the bottoms of your hair and air dry. Warning: if you spray too much, your hair WILL get crunchy and heavy. I have very thick, wavy to curly hair and I use 1-2 sprays per side of my head, then scrunch and sometimes dry it with my towel. If you feel like you sprayed too much, wet your hair a little to make it less strong!
"
"
This is exactly what I need when my hair isn't fluffed after I blow-dry it.  I turn upside down and spray the underside of my hair and then fluff with my hands and it stays the way I have put it then.  It works beautifully, and I know that this is a product I will always need to keep on hand.
"
"
I am a believer!! I place a dollop of the light defining gel in my palm and then squirt 5-6 squirts of this right into the gel, mix it all up, and then scrunch into my wet hair, dry with a diffuser and I am so pleased with how my curly hair comes out.  Doesn't get crunchy, stays put, and not weighed down.
"
"
It's more like a leave-in conditioner that helps define your curls. I use it daily.
"
"
Works great on taking the frizz out of curls, especially two or three days after washing hair. Tightens up the curls.
"
"
Definitely works to control frizzy curly hair. I use in warmer months and on vacation in hot climate,  made a huge difference.  Highly recommend.  I applied when hair was wet. Very nice scent as well, not too heavy.
"
"
I love all Deva products, but this is one of my must haves.  I spray this on my damp hair after a wash and I also use it on nonwash days to spruce my curls back up and tame flyaways.

Great product!  My daughter has extremely curly/frizzy hair.  This product allows the curls to come back together.  She's 6 years old and extremely active so it probably has a 6-8 hr hold before she begins frizzing out again through outside playing and so forth.  My only complaint is that it doesn't hold longer.  I wish it were slightly more stiff.......just personal preference....but a good product regardless.
"
"
Deva ""Set It Free"" is a product I can't be without and the 2 bottle set was an excellent buy on Amazon. I always get good results when I  apply Set It Free to my hair as a finishing product. Sometimes I spray it directly on my hair, other times I use it as most suggest, spray it in my hands first, then apply it to my hair..  Both ways work for me.
"
"
Seems more like a texturizing spray than a hair spray. Leaves hair feeling tacky and dull! Purchased 1 time, wouldn’t purchase again!
"
"
Makes my day 2-3 curls look absolutely incredible but it does leave a residue and feels slightly gucky. I still love to use this on the day I plan to wash my hair and it looks even better than fresh curls.
"
"
My daughter has VERY curly hair- using this product with the Deva Gel has been awesome. Frizz gone, nice curls that stay. We use it after the No-Poo ""shampoo"" and the One Conditioner- while hair is wet, put alot of gel and spray this also-- works wonders-and trust me we have spent thousands of dollars trying different products.  I also use the spray on dry hair it to touch up her hair before school. Just spray and use hands to tame frizz down. Go Deva if you have curly hair-it works!!
"
"
Not really dry hairspray. Goes on wettish. Nice scent, but not quite what I was looking for. I do like this product line to use w natural hair.
"
"
Deva Curl Moisture Lock Set it free is a must for Diva's with curls. The trick to this product is less is more and water. You need to spray hair with water before and after use. If you use too much your hair will become sticky. Also don't mix too many other products with this especially if they are oil based. Now mind you this stuff ain't cheap but (it is well worth it) if you use the same amount as a salon does (2-3 pumps over entire head) you will get the same results as your stylist. Good luck.
"
"
THIS IS A WATERED DOWN PRODUCT!!  I will no longer be buying my hair products from Amazon.
"
"
Did nothing for me but overall devacurl gave me an itchy scalp
"
"
Buen producto
"
"
I can't rave about Deva Curl products enough and Set it Free is no different! I usually use this on day 2 (no wash), dry hair and it really does perk things up a bit. Sometimes I even use it on my freshly washed hair because it really just sets things in to place. BUY THIS!
"
"
This stuff is the best for getting your curls back after you have slept on your hair and it has turned into flat frizz
"
"
Item holds my hair
"
"
Love all deva products, been using them for more than a decade. This is like a setting spray to use after you have styled and put in product.
"
"
Works for curls
"
"
Loving it so far. I use it a lot to refresh my hair for second and third day hairdos.
"
"
I love the way this works on my hair. SO worth the purchase. Very happy
"
"
This is the best curl product that I have found.  I have long curly hair.  I spray it on while my hair is still wet.  This product is not sticky and does not weigh down curls.  It helps with frizz and keeps my curls soft.
"
"
wrapping a double bubble wrapped awesome customer service. so fantastic product I've used before...
"
"
I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better! I use the B'Leave in Curl Booster, the Set It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition and I love all of them.I have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair. I am so glad my stylist put me on to it. WOOHOO!! I will be using these products from now on!
"
"
I just love this hair gel.  It is light (not sticky) and definitely sets your curls free.  My hair is naturely curly and this product really helps make my hair curl.  I like that my hair is not weight down with a heavy, sticky gel (I just hate that look and feel on my hair).  This is a great haircare product for wavy or curly hair.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
I use this after I wash my hair while still wet- spray it on liberally and let dry- nice curls!
"
"
Does great for my daughter’s fine curly hair but doesn’t have a lot of “hold” for my thick curly hair! Overall love it!
"
"
This is a horrible product. It makes my hair sticky and the texture of my hair is rough afterwards (no smoothness at all). It also leaves these white flakes (almost like dandruff). I will not buy this product again nor do I recommend it.

I wish I had read the previous reviews.  I have used this product for years and the last time I ordered it, it was very watery/thin.  I always spray it in my hand and put it in my hair and this stuff runs everywhere.  I thought maybe the formula had changed.  Now I see others have had the same issues.
"
"
I had an allergic reaction to this product which included mild airway constriction.  I left a polite review about the risk on diva curls page and of course it disappeared.  Not happy with a company that will ignore the risk its products pose.

I used to be a regular client at the DevaChan NYC Salon and have been using their products for years. Set It Free is like a leave in conditioner that helps keep your hair from frizzing. I use this with Mr. Right spray, Arc Angel and the DevaChan shampoo and conditioner- it works amazing for naturally curly or wavy hair. DevaChan has youtube.com videos demonstrating the correct usage of their products, pretty helpful.
"
"
This product is a must in a daily regimen for curly hair.  You can use it while your hair is wet or dry.  It stops those unwanted frizzies.  Set It Free is fantastic.
"
"
I find it really sticky and it doesn't really do much for my hair as a finishing spray. Honestly, my hair looks the same with or without it.
"
"
I love this Moisture Lock. I can use it alone or with gel. It gives moisture to my curls and gives a bounce to my curls. Gets rid of the frizzies and makes my curls soft.
"
"
Love this product. I use it with their shampoo and conditioner and my hair looks perfect. The mist really defines my natural curl. Everyone compliments my hair. :)
"
"
This is the best curl spray! Smells good too.  Great product.  This was a great price too.  However, the listing was wrong and listed 2 bottles but it was really only one.  However, the seller quickly made good on this mistake.  A nice company with great customer service!
"
"
love the smell and feel of my hair after application . very convenient travel moisturizer
"
"
Just a little bit of this product sprayed on my hand then run through my hair helps revive my curls.
"
"
This is awesome and highly recommend to set your curls wet as you wash your wash before putting curl frene or gel.
"
"
Watered down! Might be in the same bottle, but definitely not the same product.... seems easy to split the bottle and add water...
"
"
The scent is wonderful, and the product does a great job of refreshing my curly hair. I give it 3-stars because it leaves a waxy residue. This product is good for a one-day refresh, but not to refresh your hair for several days between washes.
"
"
This product has made my curls look amazing!  I have heard about it for years, and finally gave in to it.  I have no regrets, although it is pricey it is well worth it.  Can't use any other product in my hair.
"
"
Love Deva Curl products - this particular one is great for fine hair. I use this alone with a pump of the styling creme. Check out their web site for styling tip videos. I went from a short style blow dry to a curly girl and I'm loving it.
"
"
I wish DevaCurl wasn’t as pricey but it’s the only thing that makes my curls last and not frizz
"
"
This stuff smells like bug spray and dried out my hair. I used it several times in several manners; wet, damp, and dry hair. No matter how I used it my hair ended up way more dry and frizzy than using it without.
"
"
This product tames down my frizzes and makes my hair more manageable.  I love the smell!  I do warn if you use this product a little to much it can make your hair feel greasy, a trial and error type of thing.
"
"
Soft loose curls
"
"
Love this hair product. It's light and doesn't leave a film on my hair while locking in moisture.
"
"
The perfect finishing spray for textured hair!
"
"
Awesome product! Price was good and fast shipment
"
"
It's the only thing I use and I have no frizz when I let my hair dry naturally. I LOVE this product!
"
"
Purchased this based on the 30 plus 5 star reviews.I have tried several Deva Curl products and LOVE them. This one....I regret the purchase. I bought it as a 2-pack and have used roughly over 1/5 of it(6oz)...both spray nozzles spray in a ""v"" form and not effective to application of hair. Afterwards, the feeling it leaves on my hair is tacky,""dirty"" need to wash my hair feeling! so disappointed. All other Deva curl products never left my hair feeling anything but clean & wonderfully scented. As far as the ""enhance curls"" goes I didn't notice anything different than when I simply spray a little water on my hair to rejuvenate curl. Also can't comment in the ""moisture lock or no frizz"" it claims. Unfortunately for me I have waited past the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with a product I won't use at a $30.00 investment.Sorry, but this product does not warrant a positive review in my opinion.
"
"
perfect!
"
"
Love, love, love my Deva Curl products!!!
"
"
This is the first time trying this product and I do like it for a finishing spray
"
"
Really takes the frizz away from my curls-- I apply it while my hair is airdrying and it works like a charm!
"
"
It hold the curls but it didn’t make it shiny or give it any luster
"
"
Love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it! is the best product I have ever used for my hair
"
"
Love the product but it Seem to take longer than usual to ship
"
"
I spray it on along with gel after washing my hair. It smells great and makes my curls a bit poofier, which is exactly what I wanted!!
"
"
ok product for my hair.
"
"
I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.It's a super addition and it smells terrific too!
"
"
Revives my day old curly hair and smells great. Just use sparingly!
"
"
The ONLY curl spray ever that doesn't make your hair crunchy.
"
"
I have 4b African American natural hair and I love this product on my hair.  So far I have used it for wet setting.  Based on others reviews, I made sure I first applied my leave in for moisture, then castor oil and shea butter to seal that moisture in.  Then the Set it Free.  The product seems to prvent frizz, which I didn't even think I had any.  My hair also seems softer and has a sheen.  But maybe it's because it's not as frizzy.  I used it for twists.  Finally I have a staple product!
"
"
This keeps my frizz tamed, and I do find it works for about 48 hours. Beyond that, a couple of sprays in the palm scrunched into my frizzy areas keeps it going.
"
"
Arrived on time. I love this product. It really works for my fine curly hair.
"
"
I bought this based on the recommendations I read on [...]I hate to say it but I was disappointed in this product. It did not really reduce frizz and when used on dry hair it actually created frizz. It also leaves a residue on my hair which is not at all nice. I now have two bottles of this that I probably won't use and it wasn't cheap.I've used the Deva Care and Deva Curl One conditioners and I really like both of those products. But everything else I've tried from this company has not worked out for me. I have 3b/c hair by the way.
"
"
I use this immediately out of the shower, but it's also a great mid-day spray.  Not too sticky, it's just right.
"
"
Excellent!
"
"
I've used this for years and it's been great but this product now has a different smell (used to be citrus fresh, now I don't know what it is but I don't like it at all) and seems to be a different formula - much heavier and makes my hair stiff. Sad about this purchase.
"
"
I have been using this product for almost two years and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!
"
"
Makes my hair frizzy.
"
"
Item as described and quick shipping
"
"
Love the product.
"
"
THIS WORKS GREAT ON MY CURLY HAIR
"
"
Great doing and great product! :-)
"
"
Leaves hair sticky
"
"
Horrible!! Totally fake and not a real Deva product
"
"
I have been using the Devacare and Devacurl products for the last five years. My curls are plentiful though hair is fine, and my hair has never looked better than when I'm using Deva products. Right out of the shower, I scrunch my wet hair with paper towels, apply Arc Angell and Set It Free, scrunch a little more, then wait for it to dry. The Set It Free has cured me of that gel-dried-to-crunchiness issue (which is fantastic, as that is not my best look). I've never applied it on my hair while it's dry so haven't a clue what the effect would be if I did.
"
"
It really does keep the curls and it doesn't leave a sticky feel
"
"
I love this product as it keeps my curls from frizzing and does not make my hair stiff.  The pump gets almost all the product out of the bottle with just a little left in the bottom.  Amazon has the best price I have found!
"
"
Great stuff,
"
"
A must have for anyone with curls. The best product out there. I get constant compliments on my hair when I use this, no friz, just glossy curls.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I love their products; and I bought two bottle of the ""Set it free"" hair products. I order packages all the time to my building complex and for some strange reason the package was denied. I e-mailed them and I was told that once they got the shipment back, they would e-mail me on how to proceed. NOW they are telling me there is NO way they can send my package and they told me they paid for shipping and handling. Last time I checked, I PAID SHIPPING AND HANDLING. They didn't even reach out to ask if they could help me, just shut me down and refunded my $26.00 without shipping and handling. I love their products but after this experience, I'd rather make my own leave in conditioner with conditioner and water.
"
"
deva products for my daughter = happy hair!  the world is a better place with deva - lovely defined curls.
"
"
Great for curly hair. Very natural feel on hair. Not crunchy. Lasts throughout the dayWish they did bigger bottles.
"
"
Deva Curl Products are awesome for naturally curly hair.  Deva Curl Moisture Lock, Set it Free is my favorite...it helps prevent the frizzies.
"
"
LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR MY CURLY HAIR
"
"
I love Diva Curl styling products. I have long hair that has curl to it but it needs product to bring the curls out and hold them. All of the Diva style products do this for me and Set it Free is the icing on the cake and pumps up the curl and holds it.  I put in Diva gel scrunch the curls and then let it dry a bit and then add Set It Free and wow ! Beautiful loose curls!!  I am super anal anout product and picky. I highly recomend Diva !!!
"
"
Set It Free is part of a system from Deva Curl. I do not use the entire system however Set It Free remains a part of my hair routine. The secret to using most curl products is to apply them to wet hair. Immediately after hair washing I remove very little water from my hair. Absolutely no twisting the hair up in a towel. I also use a microfiber towel. I do not comb my hair what so ever. Then I apply a curl leave in conditioner or light non silicone frizz control product. I next apply a gel. Once again, no silicones or alcohols in the gel. Next comes the Set It Free. I am fairly liberal with the amount but I have a very thick head of hair. The water I initially left in my hair really helps to move all these products around throughout my hair. Once all these products are applied, I scrunch my hair from end up to my roots. I even turn my head upside down and keep the scrunching process going. I use to the diffuser attachment for drying my hair. I lay my hair on top of the diffuser and move the diffuser towards my scalp. I hold it in the same position for a good amount of time. I keep moving it all around my head until it feel closer to damp. This process creates a ""set"" to the waves. I have tried this process without the Set It Free and I don't get the same curl separation or frizz control. Day 2, 3 and even 4 days after the hair washing I will use a spray bottle to apply water to my locks. Sometimes I add more Set It Free on non-shampoo days. I use the diffuser each time and it recreates that great curl separation. It has taken me about 1.5 years to get this system figured out. The key to the success is to have really wet hair to start the product application, not to manipulate the hair too much with my hands and to leave the hair alone until it is completely dry. Set It Free is worth a try. Just understand it is trial and error until you get it right.
"
"
I've had ""Set it Free"" for a couple of years but didn't see any benefit and stopped using it.  I'm not happy with either Angel or ArcAngel in my very fine, frizzy hair, especially after the first day. I try not to wash my hair every day, just wet it. I've tried so many anti frizz products I could open a store, but yesterday I decided to try something different and sprayed Set it Free on wet, freshly washed and conditioned hair and it worked great. It still looked good today with just a little attention. I like Deva shampoos and conditioner, just didn't like the finishing products. I have a hair stylist who follows the Deva cutting method and uses her products and when she does it it looks good but I don't have the patience to spend the amount of time she does on a daily basis.  My hair got curlier during menopause although I still have areas that aren't as curly as others, and I now color it which has changed the texture and I just can't style it the way I used to. this has been a real challenge for me, the gel makes me look like a poodle .Lots of products in my hair makes it look awful. If anyone has any further suggestions I'd love to hear them.
"
"
I'm kind of floored by the negative reviews on this product, because I LOVE it.  For the first time in my life, my curly hair looks lush and frizz free.  I couldn't be happier.  I love the Devacurl products.  I use Devacurl Nopoo, Conditioner, Angell, and finish with the Set It Free.  My hair looks amazing!  All of the products smell great.  The only downside is the cost.  I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to spending money on beauty products, but this is my splurge.  I highly recommend giving them a try.  Maybe they aren't working for the other curlies, because they have not read the ""Curly Girl"" book that tells you how to apply the products and style your hair the ""curly girl"" way.  All I know is that my hair loves this stuff!
"
"
Deva Curl Moisture Lock came as a free sample with my Deva Curl diffuser.  I am so glad I didn't buy this stuff and can't wait to wash it out of my hair!!  It feels sticky and seems to create frizz.  I have tried a lot Deva Curl products which I love.  This one not at all!
"
"
helps the curls stay defined
"
"
Love this stuff! Not sticky, tames some of the frizz and smells pretty good.
"
"
This spray works great to put on your hair before or after blow drying to keep moisture in. I do have to be careful not to use too much, or it makes my hair feel gummy. I know some people spray it in their hands to apply but, I find it easier to hold the bottle atleast a foot away from my head and spray the product. I notice a definite difference in terms of frizz with the dry winter air at the end of the day if I do not use it.
"
"
When bought elsewhere this is a great product. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing. I received a watered down version in a dirty bottle and no cap.
"
"
Took a gamble on this product. But very moisturizing on my 4c, loo porosity hair. Very light weight for daily or every other day usage. I spray all over my hair after washing and conditioning with Deva C products, b leave in, and ultra gel. Good for adding extra moisture in the winter regimen. Sometimes I spray this on at night  and use the baggy method. Hair is soft the next day.
"
"
This initially seemed to work well, but I noticed every time I used it my hair started to look frizzy and feel brittle. It made my hair incredibly dry and the buildup was hard to remove. I used more initially thinking my hair was just dry. It took a lot to get the buildup out of my hair and make my hair soft again. I'd skip this product.
"
"
This arrived a day earlier than it said. It is everything it said it would be. I recommend it and honestly repurchase it every few months because I love it so much. It does wonders for my curly hair.
"
"
This is a good detangling product, but it was way too oily even for my dry hair.  It just flattened it down and made it look like I hadn't washed my hair in a month.  I think it would work well on folks who need the extra moisture, which is what I thought I needed.  Oh well, I still like the Supercream and the Ultra Defining Gel.  Also, the mirror curl product is nice, just don't use too much if you have finer hair.
"
"
I have used this product for 3 years and LOVE it, but this particular shipment caused me to break out in a rash and itch all over my head and neck.  The bottle also had a pin point leak in it which spread over my counter top.  I really believe the bottle was tampered with and something was put into it to cause this reaction.
"
"
I'm a repeat customer.  I always buy this product here because the price is right and it works miracles on my curls.  The fragrance is beautiful and it extends time in between washing my hair.  No more frizzies.  It goes fast because everyone in my family has 3b or c curls and  loves Deva Curl.  I'd be broke if I paid regular retail prices
"
"
The best. Smells lovely, and gives your hair just a bit of.... squenchiness. That's a word, right? Well, I use it to revive my curls just a bit in the morning. I water it down some so I can get it a little damper, and it seems to be just the right amount of moisture to boost the curl without adding frizz.
"
"
I love using this spray to smooth my frizzies.  The smell is absolutely amazing.  If they ever change the fragrance on this I'll be devastated.
"
"
This product was watered down. I'm not sure if the seller put water in it or something but the consistency was completely different.  The scent was different too. And because it was watered down it didn't moisturize my hair they way it normally does. I've been using this product for year so I can tell the difference
"
"
I use this to set my curls after shampooing, but I mostly use this to refresh my curls daily.  I couldn't live without this.
"
"
Love this stuff for the entire family. I usually like to purchase the larger bottle but it was not available.
"
"
I have been using this stuff for 3 years and will continue to do so! I don't trust anything other than DevaCurl on my curls!
"
"
Great for curly hair! Love this entire line of products
"
"
I can't live without this stuff for my wavy hair. It gives it more wave. I get lots of complements on my hair when I use this product compared to other hair products.
"
"
Smelled awful and made my hair frizzy.
"
"
awesome price and fast shipping; only wish you made a travel size
"
"
This product really helps refresh your hair the next day so you don't have to wash your hair everyday, which is important for curly girls so they don't dry out their hair from over-washing.  It has a pleasant aroma that I often get compliments on.  It gets 4 starts instead of 5 because it's on the pricey side.
"
"
I have natural curly hair and I love it.
"
"
Tiny bottle
"
"
Most favorite curly hair product. Love this stuff
"
"
I live in humid Miami, FL and Deva Curl is currently my go to product.  Anyone with curly hair knows that their hair needs to stay moisturized for a nice curl.  I spray this on, especially on my ends before using either the gel or the mousse.
"
"
No other product is as effective in getting my hair to maintain its curliest state. Love it!!
"
"
I purchased pretty much the entire Deva Curl line when I had my hair longer and was wearing it curly/wavy. This product is just OK...not particularly good nor bad. For the money, I would not purchase again. I found drugstore products that worked just as well, smelled better, and were far cheaper than this.
"
"
I buy this over and over again. I take it to my hairdresser when I get a hair a cut.  I would not ever be with out it
"
"
Perfect for second-day curls taming the frizz.
"
"
I love all the deva product... it make my hair very soft and manageable..
"
"
A little of this goes a long way.  I use probably 5-6 pumps in my hands then run it thru my hair after it has been washed and air dried.  It helps to remove the crunchiness left behind from the gel but still helps the curls to stay chunky.  It has kind of a waxy build up to it if you use too much.  It smells like sweet tarts, which I like too!
"
"
I was a Ouidad girl but have switched back to Deva and now I don't know why I ever left Deva. This works great used alone to refresh curls or combined with an-gel when your curls are wet. Great smell and nice feel. Does right by my curls.
"
"
Love the deva curl products. I have now used the no poo, one condition , light gel and the set it free spray for a year solid. My hair is in the best shape it has been in years and I get so many compliments on my curls. They are soft, springy and not frizzy. Love this product.
"
"
This is the best stuff for curly hair, you won't be disappointed!  I can't live without it.
"
"
PERFECT for curly or wavy hair.  Keeps the frizz away without making my hair look greasy, stiff, dull or shiny.  Very natural look with this product.
"
"
Awesome. Just love this stuff. Works wonderful.
"
"
love the products
"
"
Best product for curly Hair!! I order every week!!!
"
"
It's a creme based spray.  The Deva videos say to use it after using the styling product, either ArcAngel gel or the One Condition conditioner.  So I thought it was a setting spray, somewhat like a hairspray..???  But no, it neither sets the style nor does anything else really.  Curly haired people, have you ever tried using a ""no-frizz"" serum and then gel?  You end up with a sticky frizzy mess, kinda like with this product.  It does work as a great smoothing spray for my daughter who has straight hair, but it ultimately fails at it's intended purpose.  It claims to be a ""moisture lock"" but since using the Deva line, my hair is dryer than ever.  I'm not sure there is any poertion of the line that I would re-order.  Perhaps maybe the NoPoo....no guarantees.
"
"
This is my favorite product from the DevaCurl line!!  It really helps the curl, and refreshes the next day as well.
"
"
I'll give the product two stars simply 'cos it seems to work for other reviewers and it smells good. I really want to like Deva Curl products but they're not working out for me. I am a guy who's trying to wear his hair long but battling constant dryness and frizz. Today I used a little Mist-er Right and Set it Free and had disastrous results (even frizzier and drier than usual). I'm following the instructions and am not sure what I'm doing wrong. I can't recommend this product for my hair type (""s-wavy"" to ""wavy"" according to Deva Curl). There's gotta be something better out there. I'll keep looking and write a positive review whenever I find it!
"
"
Have used nothing but Deva for 8 years! Never going back.
"
"
Brings out my curls.
"
"
Love it - first product I use in the morning on my long curly hair.
"
"
Love it
"
"
I use this in the mornings, holds my curls the entire day. No frizz whatsoever. All  the Deva products are great.I recommend all of them.
"
"
Love it helps my curls a lot
"
"
This is one of the best DEVA products and I just recently learned about it.
"
"
Awesome!  Soft and shine curls!
"
"
Love Deva Curl! Wish they still offered the larger size.
"
"
Exactly as expected
"
"
Love love love it!!!! It makes my curls so soft and hydrating.
"
"
Best product for curly hair.
"
"
makes my hair so curly & defined!!
"
"
This stuff works amazing on curly hair! Highly recommend!
"
"
Love this product and many of the Deva Curl items. This works fabulously as a curl revitalizer on 2nd and 3rd day curls. I now use the Deva no-poo shampoo, the Deva one conditioner, the light defining gel, and then the Deva Set-it-free on no wash days.
"
"
I've used this item before and I know what it is supposed to look like and feel like. I've always liked this product. This specific bottle was watered down. I'm very disappointed.
"
"
Does not work for me, it dries out my hair and does nothing to hold my natural curly hair. Sorry
"
"
Great finishing product for all day hold on my curls, I use it alone in the summer when humidity becomes an issue.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Love all of Deva Curl products but I can't live without this. First thing I put on my hair after I wash and condition it. I don't have naturally curly hair, I have long stick straight hair naturally. But I've been getting super curly perms in the past two years for body and to break the boredom and even though I get my hair highlighted blonde these products have kept it pretty healthy!
"
"
I tried a sample size of this and liked it.  After buying the full size and using it several days in a row, I find that it coats my hair and leaves it feeling sticky, and I still have frizz.
"
"
works as advertised and I love the smell too
"
"
I used this product once & it does not work. Made my hair look & feel terribly dry. Smells horrible too & really over priced for such a horrible product. I had to wash my hair almost immediately after my hair dried & the product set in. My hair was a ball of frizz. I will NEVER again betray Shea Mousture products (they are truly the best in my hair). I decided to try this stuff as I was traveling to Florida & I read this was suppose to be good for high humidity & it is the worse product I've ever tried! Never again! Save your money! This stuff is so expensive & does not work on high porosity 3B/3C curly hair like mine. (This is the same review I left for the Deva Curl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam as I used this with the foam & Heaven In Hair treatment & they are all horrible!)
"
"
I have a love-hate relationship with this product, although I continue to buy it and use it. I use several of the Deva Curl products, including No Poo and One Condition. I have had a hard time finding a styling product that really works with my hair. I'm pretty picky and don't like gel or mousse, but I do love their new curl creme.Back to Set It Free. The reason I love it: my curls always look amazing, and it works great to reactivate second day curls, plus it smells great.The reason I hate it: if you use too much, your curls end up sticky/tacky and stiff. I have a serious hair obsession and often play with my hair, which is probably the reason I don't always love this product. I want my hair to be super soft and plyable but look amazing, and it seems a hard goal to achieve. With Set It Free and the new Deva curl cream, my hair comes pretty close to perfect.

Those of us who grew up with images of Boy George, Madonna and Michael Jackson on MTV 24/7 will understand what I mean. If you too were traumatized by staining, bad smelling and flammable goo they called hair gel in this era, but still have a mop of curls to tame, your worries are over. Being lead like wooly headed sheep to pledge loyalty to any single product line is not for me. Other shampoos and conditioners on the market will do the trick, but Deva Curl Moisture Lock will polish your look like you invested in all the expensive stuff. It will not cause build-up. It will not leave a grease spot on your pillow. Most of all it will give you the one thing most of us curly headed folks never really get a chance to enjoy - consistency!  Amazon's Auto-Drop feature will also give you a better price than any of the so-called discount beauty supply shops out there.
"

I've tried most of the products in the Deva line, and while I use and like the LowPoo and One Condition in the DEVACare line, and I like to refresh with Mist-er Right, and I use B-leave In to refresh with conditioner on 2nd and 3d days, and I like Arc Angell, THIS STUFF DID NOTHING as promised. Frizz was not reduced. Moisture was not locked in.Now, granted, I have dry 3b hair with high porosity. Maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair. But for me, nada. Zip.It does smell nice, though. That earns it at least one star. I have one bottle that I'll finish up--I use it when I use Mist-er right to add a layer of nice scent, citrus over lavender. Careful not to spritz too much, or your hair gets a dull, sort of waxy feel.But, really,can't recommend it.Ingredients:IngredientsAqueous Extracts of: Achilea Millefolium, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Cymbopogon Schoenanthus, Humulus Lupulus (Hops), Melissa Offcinalis (Balm Mint), Rosmarinus Offcinalis (Rosemary), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkylmethacrylate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, PVP, Beeswax, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Lipids, Sodium Hydroxide, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance.

I have fine, wavy, very unruly hair, prone to frizz.  For years, I used gobs of product and lots of hairspray to set the whole mess.  I found out through trial and error the sulfate and alcohol in the products were my worst enemy.  I now use all sufate-free products and my hair feels like it never did before.  I use Set-it-free as a finishing spray on dry hair and it forms a barrier against moisture, leaving a soft sheen behind.  You have to practice to get the right amount for your hair, so start small and work up.  WONDERFUL STUFF, I need to stock up in case they discontinue it!! I have been a licensed hairstylist for 30 years, so I have tried many of the best professional products.  Deva Curl has some of the best stuff on the market for frizz control.
"
"
i love this stuff. I've never had any issues with the product.I can't  see how there are so many poor reviews.
"
"
After No Poo, One Conditioner and the gel... this is my favorite Deva product!
"
"
It is a good product.
"

I can't believe how one product saved my hair!!! That cream is a miracle! I only need one product now and I used to be a product junkie bc nothing worked for my curly dry, low porosity hair. I don't even think I need leave in. Woke up this morning thinking I had to do my hair but my hair is a nice beautiful curly afro today. So I won't even touch it. And I'm in day 6 since I washed it and wet it. It's a miracle for my curly hair!!
"
"
THe product came on time, the smell is really good.But this product is not for me. I have 3c 4a hair My hair feels really heavy and opaque.
"
"
It like putting Crisco or Lard on hair! It's super thick but worse, no slip! Very Greasy though! It leaves white pecks when wet that has a way of disappearing as it dries.....only to become White Flakes so that it looks like your hair is snowing everywhere! Yes, I worked it in and work it through while applying. What elongation?! I mainly got it for hydration, but did not receive elongation! I used it twice with a few weeks in between and same results.I did not like how it applied when wet.I did not like how it dried.If you think you like it after the first use, wait 24 hours and shake your hair...just a little. And don't you Dare put on a dark top or dress.😲I barely made an dent in the thick Goo, and wish I could return this, but had it for a couple of months already.
"
"
If I could give this a 0 I would.  It did the exact opposite of elongating my hair.  It actually made it shrink up shorter.  I gave this product 2 tries and applied it as directed but each time my hair shrunk up so short I had to rinse the product out and use my old stuff.  The worst part is I reached out  to the seller to inquire about the product and why this happened.  If a return was possible and they didn't even respond.  Horrrible customer service.  Which in my mind is worst than a bad product.

I just got this product in the mail and applied it when my hair was wet. It’s super thick so I thought it would moisturize my hair. The minute I applied it to my hair it felt super rough in my hair and my hair got all tangled immediately. I’m wondering now if this is fake product because I’ve heard so many great reviews about this product. It made my hair just feel super dry and not moisturized at all. I will be returning this product.
"
"
Disappointed!!!Too greasy and no elongation! Not for fine hair.
"
"
Saw a lot of positive reviews so did not believe the negative ones. However a negative one that I remember reading was exactly right. This product is not easy to apply and heavy, made my hair feel like carton while applying it and made it super dry...to the point that I rinsed it out immediately and had to apply conditioner...I do not have super kinky hair. Returing it.
"
"
My fav DevaCurl product! The definition I get is crazy but it leaves my hair soft and touchable. I don’t quite get the obsession with elogation but that’s just me.
"
"
As a woman with 4c hair, this is ABSOLUTELY everything that I need. It is not too heavy, it smells good, it doesn't leave residue, and it helps reduce shrinkage when styling. As far as using it for styling,  this has helped my hair stay conditioned, it doesn't cause flakes when it dries, and it holds very well. I have no complaints and will continue to purchase this product. (The pictures provided are the end result of me using it to style my hair. Very happy!)
"
"
This product is extremely sticky and makes your curls even tighter then they already are.

My favorite curly leave in. A little goes a long way when it comes to DevaCurl products. I have 3B hair and the Super Stretch really elongates my curls, give them shine, moisture, and definition. It’s also cheaper on Amazon than on the DevaCurl website and at Sephora.
"
"
I like this product I have long curly hair and have ALL THE SHRINKAGE. I recommend using a leave in conditioner before adding this product on top, as far as detangling there isn't a ton of slip that's why I normally use a leave in conditioner first. The smell is great but be careful how much of this product you put in because you will get some flaking especially if you have dark hair. Hold lasts all day and isn't super crunchy which is great!Pics to follow!
"
"
This stuff is crazy awesome!!
"
"
Love this product...it gives more curl definition than stretch but great nevertheless.  I do add a liitle deva arc angel gel when its super humid outside to get more days out of the style. And hair is super bouncy & soft.
"
"
I really like the smell of the product and it does well holding my hair.  If you use too much it will flake up like dandruff.
"
"
Unfortunately this didn't work for my hair and it was really hard getting out of the container. Wish it had had a pump.
"
"
This stuff has the consistency of Crisco and hard to apply. It made some difference in my curl length but made it dry. Reviewing the ingredients I noticed it contains lye which is used in relaxers. I've been trying to figure out why I have all these broken straight pieces of hair despite not applying heat to my hair. After hearing about all the Deva curl allegations I decided to pay closer attention to the ingredients
"
"
I have 4C hair.  I used it for a wash n go and when my hair dried, it was the same shrinkage I normally get when letting my hair air dry.  No elongation there.  Tried it with a flat twist and had the same results, no extra stretch but nice hold for two days.  Its a creamy styler but not worth replacing other stylers that work on your hair.
"
"
Returned all my deva products, company it’s under a lawsuit investigation. My hair it’s really dry and I have lost so much hair after using devacurl products. Will not use anymore :(
"
"
I just want long, curly hair. This tries to give me that but it doesn’t look like the hair in my imagination.
"
"
This is my second jar even before finishing half of my first one, i so in love with this product
"
"
The product definitely defined my hair and added some moisture but failed to deliver on ELONGATING my curls. I'm natural 4c low porosity. Overall a good product but not worth the high price. I had same reults with a flaxseed gel for $4.For a $26 pricetag Devacurl need to BRING IT!!!
"
"
Good hair product
"
"
Love this product.  Only draw back there are some white flakes when dry.
"
"
I usually love DevaCurl products, but this one had to much hold and not enough moisture for my 3C hair. I will return it or give it away.
"
"
Great product. This will bring me back to Deva Curl.
"
"
LOVE this product. DOES what it says. My hair looks healthy. I don't have course hair, its waivy with a perm. Still, to maintain the curls looking healthy and not dry, this product is the biznez.
"
"
Excellent product, does exactly what it says it would do.
"
"
The product did not suit my hair the way I expected. It actually made my hair a bit dry after applying it on my wet hair and then drying it.The texture of my hair became rough. I clubbed it with Shea butter after hair cream and it was manageable.
"
"
Works great on my daughters hair. Love the deva curl line.
"
"
Absolutely love this product. Works perfect and my hair stays long and curly for 4 to 5 days if I choose to wait to wash again.
"
"
Smells okay but doesn't stretch my hair, it doesn't moisturize or favor my curls either.
"
"
My new favorite for curl control. Not crunchy when dry. Tip: don’t touch hair until completely dry then fluff with raking fingers. Perfect for me.
"
"
I h ave naturally curly hair and this product works to control the frizz. Take a small piece of hair, coat lightly and the curls look great!Love the coconut fragrance!
"
"
Too dry for my hair.  I gave it to my sister. The product is too expensive to be so disappointing.
"
"
Great product, works as promised.  Will definitely reorder
"
"
The product does help stretch out my hair by adding some weight to the ends so I really like it for that reason.  My hair is quite fine so I only add it to the ends.  I would recommend it.
"
"
Loved it!
"
"
This product does exactly what it say it will,STRETCH!!! It’s so moisturizing too! Of all the products I’ve tried so far for natural hair, this is the best.
"
"
I love the brand however it leaves small white bits in your hair. I first thought it was me not applyiyot properly but then was told by someone else who uses it that they had the same issue.
"
"
I have tried several products to stretch my hair and this is by far the best. I’ve gotten so many compliments. I dislike the texture but I can deal with that to get the desired stretch I’m after.
"
"
This product did not elongate my hair. It also left my hair dry. This product was not worth the price.
"
"
Love this product, fast shipping
"
"
I love this product. It works best when my hair is wet. Definitely happy with devacurl!
"
"
Nice hold w/o crunch or greasy feeling.
"
"
Thank you.  I receive the product. Fast response
"
"
Bought this for my niece, great product
"
"
I like this product diva curl super stretch i used it for my braid out  my hair was Saul my curls with this phone I will purchase this again.
"
"
I love this!! Makes my curls so soft and long lasting.  Totally recommend this!
"
"
Love anything devacurl this stuff is amazing!
"
"
I give it 3 star review because I was expecting better results
"
"
Did not stretch my hair as promised
"
"
Easy to use
"
"
Made my platinum blond mixed girl hair look great!
"
"
exactly as described
"

Wonderful product, surprised my expectations.
"
"
Awesome

I love it made my hair beautiful
"
"
Product is great and highly recommended it!
"
"
Dried my hair out so bad...
"
"
Me encanta, lo amo😍
"
"
Very Disappointing
"

Great product

I have been using this product since it was launched. I love it. It softens my hair and defines my curls.  I have fine  4B hair. As far as the elongation that people have a problem with, If you have tight curls, you can't expect miracles. It makes them longer then if you define them without any product. It will not make your tight curls look like loose curls. I use this product because my scalp gets irritated from gels if I use them too often. This product gives my scalp a break. It also does not have parabens and sulfates like other curl defining creams do.  This product is a soft hold product. It will not make a gel cast. So if you need a gel cast for your curls to last, then I wouldn't get this product.  However, if you refresh your hair with a bit of water in the morning, then this product will reactivate the curl with no problem.
"
"
This product turned my shiny, 3C curls into a fluffy frizzy MESS. I thought it would just relax the curls a little. Didn't seem to elongate at all, just added tons of frizz and stickiness. Normally I can run my fingers through it but this makes it feel like it has glue in it. I have tried different devacurl products over the years but none have ever won my heart. This one's probably the worst.
"
"
For my 4a/3c curls, this product made me fall in love with my curls all over again!  I’m going to repurchase and try on my two daughters hair as well.  I used a leave in underneath, the Auntie Jackie’s half & half.  My curls aren’t stretched but they are super moisturized and just the right amount of hold to eliminate frizz- but not too much that it leaves a crunchy cast.  Day 2 hair is even better!  No flakes either!  I washed my hair beforehand with a gentle moisturizing shampoo and conditioned with a conditioning balm to prep.
"
"
My hair has never looked better after I used only this one product! My curl pattern was not only super defined but this also added a lot of shine and hold to my hair (something I NEED). The only thing though was that it left my hair too greasy and therefore not touchable, but I will see what happens if I use a little less next time.
"
"
My favorite hair product!
"
"
So I'm between 3C/4A, very curly, thirsty hair which gets about 70% shrinkage. I tried this after all of the great reviews here and on YouTube and I was instantly disappointed. There's no slip with this product in my hair, which makes it feel even almost brittle. Mind you, I LOVE Devacurl products! That's all I use, so needless to say, I had high hopes for this one. I returnedPros: Smells good, does not make hair crunchy, per seCons: Did not stretch curl and did not moisturize
"
"
This product left my 4c, high porosity, texturized, natural hair moisturized, shiny and super defined. I applied it on soaking wet hair, which really makes a difference. I didn’t need or use a leave-in conditioner. It’s a one and done product! 😍
"
"
I’ve purchased this product a few times and will continue to do so. It works well on my 3b/3c hair. A word of caution, just be careful about mixing your products. I noticed that some people mentioned white lumps and drying with white flakes appearing on their hair. This definitely happens if the product does not react well to other products (including shampoos and conditioners) used on your hair. This always happens to me when I use shampoos with Shea butter and then apply my leave in products afterwards. It’s happened with this product too. Just test out sample areas and try not to mix your brands. I LOVE the DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator creme. It smells great and works as advertised! [But, my curly hair friends, you do still need to seal with oil moisturizer and set your hair, as normal. ;-) ]
"
"
I love this product and like that I don't have to diffuse.
"
"
It’s a really good product, you will get longer and very well defined curls,  with a nice well moistured look,  however it’s a little greasy for my hair.
"
"
I love this stuff. I don't know that it elongated my curls but mine are kind of loose anyway. So, I don't get alot of shrinkage. The product went on easily. You are only supposed to use a small amount. So the people complaining about residue might be using too much. The same may be true for people claiming it is greasy. I did not find it greasy at all. In fact, my hair is drier than it is usually. That is the one negative thing I have to say. It is not very moisturizing on it's own. I used a leave in and it didn't help much. If you are 3/4 natural you might want to use a moisturizing cream before your gel. I used the elongating cream and the ultra defining gel and my results were pretty good.
"
"
Cost too much. Didn’t work for my 4c natural hair
"
"
Great product! Finally didn’t need 3 or four products to get definitions as well as some shine. It’s one product that does it all. I have thick hair.
"
"
The first deva product that I do not love, I have 3b curls and wanted to give curls a little Strech, product made my hair very frizzy I don’t think it’s a good wash and go product, maybe if you braid your hair .
"
"
Didn’t work for me, elongates but provides no definition. I have 3b hair, seems to be more for 3c or kinky.
"
"
I usually love deva curl products but this one leaves my hair so sticky and leaves a white buildup. I don’t like it at all.
"
"
Not at all successful on my hair. Made my hair have that sticky/dirty feeling.
"
"
Devacurl changed my life. I hated my curls. Now I know everything you need is just to find right product
"
"
Helps the curl come out. Less frizz.
"
"
Product as described
"
"
Simply doesn't stretch my curls. It's also very heavy.  I'm happy with the No-Poo and conditioner but not this product.
"
"
Left flaking residue after a few days.
"
"
Works well for very curly care.  Don't know what I would without DevaCiuel
"
"
Works well.
"
"
This product is really good. It does what it claims to do. The only issue I had was my hair wasn't as curly as I wanted it to be.
"
"
If you already have voluminous curly hair and in need of a little bit of control and/or less shrinkage you'll love it too.
"
"
Perfection
"
"
I thought I'd try this because I have had pretty great results with most of the Deva products.  I currently have 6 months grown out, deva cut, shoulder length 3B/C fair hair.  Because I've had natural hair since 2008, I have long ago learned to be light to moderate on application of any styling product.  I tried the super stretch on top of some super cream and was intrigued and I later tried it alone.  My application was on wet/damp hair in this order: applied a bit of Lush R&B, this Deva Frizz-free Volumizing Foam and then the super stretch.  I use Deva Build-up Buster for shampoo followed by Heaven in Hair.  I ended up with lovely moisturized curls that are hanging longer.  There is no magic pill when it comes to stretching products.....nothing will take a very curly or coily  hair and turn it into magically long, long, long hanging hair.  But, this does a nice job and giving some elongation.  I will continue to use this.  I really like that the cream is in a jar instead of that stupid pumps that Deva is currently using on the coconut  supercream and the cream styler .  I never feel like I get to the last drop with these.
"
"
I needed something to weigh down my 3B/C coarse hair and this does the trick without any of the stiffness of gel. It also gives my hair a nice shine, and leaves my hair touchably soft.
"
"
My day loved it
"
"
Never has my second day hair looked better!  I have fine hair, but a lot of it.  I've used it 4 times now and it doesn't take very much product.  I was worried about the price for such a small bottle, but it sprays out in a fine mist.  I only need 5 sprays around my head and I'm good to go. No frizz.  No crunch.  No overpowering smell.  Does not weigh my hair down.  I'm definitely ordering another bottle.
"
"
I usually don’t post many reviews unless I feel the product is somehow deceiving. This is the worst hair product I’ve ever used, and I have used a lot. The first photo is my hair without the product and second is with it. It initially made my hair so sticky and dry I had to shower twice to get it out of my hair. It felt like I had just sprayed my hair with hairspray. I like the Deva Curl shampoo and super cream do I thought this would be good too, but I was very wrong. It has been several days since using the spray and I can still feel my hair is dryer than normal even after washing and conditioning it. It did not add moisture nor did it control frizz. I will definitely think twice about buying any other Deva Curl product without my stylist’s recommendation or having her try it on me in the salon first.
"
"
This is a MUST HAVE for curly girls!!! I can be on my fourth post-wash day and use this stuff to help freshen-up and re-style! Dry shampoo for curls that actually smells good and dampens hair!! I use it along side water and completely wet my hair and reapply styling products (a little less than normal) and style as usual. Literally amazing!!! Definitely authentic as well. I’ve read some reviews saying their DevaCurl products aren’t authentic but everything I’ve bought on amazon is cheaper than from Sephora or online and is authentic.
"
"
I have used the curl revitalizing lavender spray by deva curl and wanted to see if this would have a little more oomph. The lavender spray smells good but doesn’t do much. The scalp and curl revitalizer is the real thing. It actually plumps up my curls and doesn’t leave a gross residue on my scalp, hands or roots. I recommend to anyone who wants a quick curl refresh on second day curls or after a hard workout.
"
"
Contains a non-water soluable wax, and therefore is not technically CGM approved. I have 3a hair. That being said, the scent is nice and I do use it to seal the ends of my hair where the most damage is, which helps cut down on frizz when it's humid out. Also works well for providing solid curl definition for an end-of-day refresh. I have not found it useful for a full refresh as the was makes my scalp look greasy and at that point it's easier to just shower.I would recommend to other 2c-3b girls that want to lock in curl definition.
"
"
I use this product to refresh between washing and it works great.  I think of it as dry shampoo for curly hair that works in reverse by adding moisture.  It is very fragrant but dissipates quickly.
"
"
I really like to use this product along with the Mister Spray. It really does help to delay wash day for at least 2-3 days or so. I have 3c hair and usually wear it in a wash-n-go. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it can leave the hair a bit hard and crunchy with a hairspray feel. I imagine that’s what keeps the hold though.  For that reason, I always mix it with the Mister Spray to get more moisture.
"
"
I used this product for my unmanageable curly hair. This product is amazing!! So lightweight and the hold is amazing! This product is phenomenal!
"
"
I simply love it. It gives back shape and freshness to your hairs even after an intense workout and a lot of sweat! amazing. Working out everyday this is exactly what I needed. Thanks Deva Curl.
"
"
I was a little skeptical since I've found most sprays don't really make much of a difference, but this one revitalizes my curls, minimizes frizz and is great for adding volume at the scalp. With this spray, I can wear my day 3 hair down and even make it last for a 4th day!

"

Still a fan of all the Deva Curl products I've tried. DevaFresh does what it's supposed to do. I use it together with Mist-Er Right
"
"
I am sensitive to scents. I should have heeded advise of another reviewer. I wheeze when I use this and want a shower. It is also a bit sticky. Not better and much more expensive than Mister Right product. Don't bother.
"
"
Curls revitalized!  Nice Product.
"
"
Love this product!  Smells great and extends my wash cycle.
"
"
I recently got my curly hair chopped and am in love with this product!  I use it to revitalize my hair after waking up or exercising and add a bit of deva curl cream to it and my hair is looking flawless! And I live in one of the most humid cities in the states, Houston!
"
"
Cannot figure this stuff out. When I use it on second day hair my hair get frizzy and sticky. Maybe I am using it wrong.
"
"
This stuff is amazing. Like dry shampoo for curly girls
"
"
This product is Amazing!!
"
"
The product makes my hair heavy product feels sticky on hair.Would not buy again
"
"
I didn’t like the smell too much.
"
"
Love it, love it, love it.  What a great product  Helps my curls look fresh for days after washing.  Would recommend it to any curly girl
"
"
I found the DevaFresh does a really good job reviving my 2nd day curls, but leaves a sticky film all over my hair.  I don't feel it worked on my scalp very well.  My hair was amazing after using it, but I felt like my head was stuck in a cotton candy maker.

I have long, thick, super curly hair. My curls look pretty bad on the second day. This product worked ok, but not as well as I’d hoped.  I love deva products, but this didnt work so well for me. It smells really nice, though.  I’ll keep looking for a second day product.
"
"
Awesome product! Works great as an alternative to dry shampoo, with the same benefits, plus it revitalizes my curls! Feels cool on the scalp. Has a nice subtle scent. Love Love Love

Love this product

I took this from the marketing to be a product to kind of replace dry shampoo for us curly girlies. I've been doing the curly girl method for a few years now, and still my hair really kind of oily by day 3. I have to use dry shampoo, or it's stringy and limp. I tried it today on day 2 hair and I feel like I dumped oil on my scalp. I have to almost wipe the residue off my hand if I touch my roots at all. I want to give it more stars as I've only used it once, and maybe I put too much in or something?? But I'm skeptical. I'll try it again if I don't have to go anywhere, but it looks like I'll use this as a curl refresher (just on the ends)...if I'm lucky. But right now I really hate it.
"

I believe this is fake or diluted. I am a regular user of this conditioner, but this is my first time buying it on Amazon. It smells normal, but it doesn't feel right. The slip isn't there. I have to use twice as much. My hair does not look good.
"
"
I think this is my 1st review ever and I had to write it to warn other potential buyers because I also received a FAKE product!I've been using DevaCurl's One Condition Delight for almost 2 years and decided to purchase this larger bottle on Amazon since it had a great price.Once I received the product, I immediately noticed the smell was not the same and the usual slip wasn't there. I stuck with it thinking it could've been just an impression, however since then, my hair has become freezy, dry and would not curl.I was intrigued and decided to ask for a sample at a local store so I could test it out. Well, it only confirmed my suspicion... the smell and the slip were exactly how I remember them to be, and my hair felt super soft and beautiful afterward. It finally felt like its old self - my curls were back!Avoid the frustration - do not buy from this seller!

I have used the original and the Decadent conditioners by Devacurl. This one works well on my 2A/2B hair type. My hair is thin so it tends to ball on the top of my head in the shower and this conditioner allows me to separate the clumps of knots that it ends up in. The other conditioners did well for this also. I wanted to switch it up and found this was a good change. I have oily skin and wash my hair daily, so the shampoo is good for that. The conditioner smells fresh and has a light citrus aroma to it. I love Devacurls products, so much!
"

Best thing to happen to my hair in my life. Ism 59 years young my hair is now the curls I always dreamed of, buy the Diva Curl Book watch the DVD . You must use this properly to get great results. When people say your hair is so pretty I say Diva Curl. So many say I tried it, it didn’t work, I tell them they aren’t using it correctly. Once they do they text me thank you so much for teaching me. I use all their products must use all products to get great results
"
"
this new lighter line has been a disappointment for my hair.  I have color treated, fine, s-wavy hair and this conditioner doesn't combat the dryness like the ORIGINAL!  The original was never heavy, just thought I would try this for fine hair.  Will not buy again.  Sorry DevaCurl ---  love you no-poo concept and have been freed from all stripping hair care for 2 years now, thanks to you.
"
"
I have tried the original, decadent, and delight versions on my daughter's hair. The original gave me headaches. I like the decadent, but thought that I would try the delight since her hair is losing some of its curl as she ages. The smell is devine.  It smells like a quality perfume putting it on, but the fragrance is mild once the hair is dry. It leaves her hair soft with lots of bounce.  It also has great slip.I also use Kinky Curly Knott Today for detangling.  I have found nothing better for that purpose.
"
"
My hair absolutely loves this product. I've tried 5 different shampoos and conditioners in the past year, and after watching several youtube videos decided to give this one a shot. I have between 1c and 2c hair strands on my hair, the majority of which are 2a and 2b. Using this and brushing a bit less, along with using the b-leave in conditioner and the wave maker have made for really beautiful waves and curls in my hair.
"
"
I used to love DC products - but this latest order - after only using it for about a month, I experienced significantly MORE hair loss, itchy scalp and breakouts on my scalp, back, neck.  Used as ""directed"" along with the other products in the line and nothing else changed - except for the fact that I bought new bottles of product.  I will no longer be using ANY DC products or recommending them to anyone.
"
"
This made all the difference in my 2c hair.  The waves aren't getting that dredlock look anymore and are bouncy once again. Don't live the smell as much as original one condition but it definitely isn't offensive.
"
"
I trust DevaCurl because their products are high quality and never fail in giving me beautiful curls . I have 2C hair and I feel like this isn't too heavy at all. It's just enough moisture. I do wish the scent wasn't as strong. It's very very strong. To me it smells a bit lemony citrus which gives me a headache so I have a bit of bias. I really do love it though. I wish they had a non-scented option! I will use the whole bottle but probably won't repurchase because of the scent :/

My hair has never looked better since I started using DevaCurl products. This conditioner is super creamy and my dry hair sucks it up. My curls are smooth, less frizzy, and super bouncy. I have long hair but the bottle still lasts for a good amount of time. The pump is nice too so there's more control over how much comes out of the bottle. I'm super happy with this product and will continue to buy.
"
"
Love everything DevaCurl! This is a newer scent I enjoy immensely.  It seems expensive but you use a small amount possibility twice a week. Meaning the cost per use is minimal. If you haven't discovered DevaCurl check out the website and purchase products on Amazon. Its not just for curly hair, they have products to enhance every type of hair from wavy to African American .
"
"
Makes a huge difference to use this product on my wavy hair. My hair looks Amazing!
"
"
Deva curl rarely disappoints. I use this in the shower after shampooing as well as after I get out of the shower. I towel dry my hair a ta, run this through my ends then roots and use this as my main and often only hair product. Works great!
"
"
I got this after being impressed with the lo-poo shampoo. This conditioner is pretty pricy if you use a lot at a time like I do (I have hair that falls just below my shoulders). I switched to Treseme Botanicals and it works just as well for a much lower price tag.
"
"
This shampoo and conditioner made my hair break and become thin. After six months of not using it my hair is finally getting back to normal
"
"
Love this product! But when I received it the cap wasn’t screwed on all the way causing the conditioner to leak all over the bag. Box was not damaged.
"
"
did not feel good in my hair at all
"
"
The product works really well, but the scent is terrible.  It has a sweet artificial smell that literally makes me feel nauseous.  I wanted so much to like it.  I had tried it at a friends house and remembered it smelling really great.  Perhaps they changed the formula.
"
"
Great conditioner, the only one I use. Doesn't cause any irritation on my scalp and hydrates my hair.
"
"
I took off a star for packing. I love the product, and I will keep buying it. I didn't have any trouble with leakage like others, but my cap was also loose. My issue with packing is this is the second time the top was broke. This makes it hard to use.  Please put some styrofoam around the top and make sure the lid is tight.
"
"
My hair is falling out since I’ve been using this stuff. Don’t buy it!
"
"
Absolutely love Deva Curl, it has done wonders for my frizzy, out of control hair.  Would be nice if it wasn't so pricey.
"
"
I’ve used this for years. Used to buy at Ulta, significantly less expensive from Amazon. I have very curly hair, and this is one of the few products that helps get a comb through is and tame the frizzies.
"
"
Love this product, great for detangling fine hair and does not weigh hair down
"
"
With Devacurl products, you really need to shop for your hair type. This product is intended for wavy hair, like it says. I have baby fine type 2 hair and I found this to be hydrating and defining for my waves. With this and the shampoo from the same line (low poo delight), I don't need additional products after I shower.
"
"
Love it
"
"
For me this was pretty blah. It smells WONDERFUL but somewhat lacklustre otherwise. I use it scrunched in dry or damp hair as a leave in conditioner and finds that works best.
"
"
The product itself is wonderful, but it arrived open. The connection between the pump and the bottle was unscrewed and the cream had spilled out all over the bag. I lost about a quarter of the bottle because of the fact that it was open during transport. Not pleased.
"
"
This product is FAKE!!! I am so disappointed! It does NOT smell like DevaCurl One Conditioner not does it feel like it. It feels like lotion. My hair is dry and damaged after using this fake product.
"
"
One of the best brand for curly/ wavy girls. No lie. It just feel like your curls is REVIVE AFTER being dead. You need your hands on this if you want your hair to be curly forever.Downside? The price.... but it is worth it.
"
"
Product itself was what I ordered but the bottle wasn't full. I'm not sure if they topped off another bottle or someone used some or what but it was almost like 1/4 of the bottle was already gone.
"
"
Best conditioning for curly hair. Lasts a long time too
"
"
Great product line for wavy-to-curly hair. Conditioner is not too heavy but adds great moisture
"
"
Love deva curl all their products rock
"
"
Love all deva curl products
"
"
love
"
"
true to size. Very cozy and warm.
"
"
Not as  moisturizing as the original conditioner. Didn’t much care for the fragrance either. Will not be purchasing this again, going back to original deva conditioner.
"
"
the only conditioner I use on my wildly curly hair
"
"
I really like some of Devacurl's products but this particular conditioner makes my hair feel greasy. I much prefer Deva Curl Ultra Creamy Daily Conditioner and would not buy this conditioner again.
"
"
I received this on time but the bottle was broken and conditioner was seeping out 😣
"
"
It's a great curly hair conditioner. Even with fine hair, it works well.
"
"
I normally co-wash my hair and this conditioner is seriously the best! I have curly/wavy long hair that is very fragile and can damage easily. With devacurl products ive been able to grow my hair super long and it looks very healthy!
"
"
Hair started falling out. New ingredients in DevaCurl are crap. Definitely not good product anymore.
"
"
Love.
"
"
So perfect for my wavy hair
"
"
Great product, awful price
"
"
perfect!
"
"
Love it. It was recommended by my sister who's a hairstylist. You don't need a lot.
"
"
I was hoping that it would be similar to the regular one condition-- just lighter-- but the scent is quite unpleasant which has made it a waste. I regret buying it.
"
"
I love the way this smells! I also love the way it works in my hair, but I've been using Deva products for a while, but just tried this one and it smells so good.
"
"
When I received the product it was all over the bag. I love the actual product though. Just wish I hadn't lost 1/4 of the bottle in the bag.
"
"
Love this stuff
"
"
I purchased 3 bottles of Deva curl conditioner. The lid was not on all the way and the product leaked out of the bottle.  The shipping box was not damaged.
"
"
This is a great product. My thick, wavy hair feels light, the waves are beautiful. Worth every penny. Same for the shampoo.
"
"
I am positive this item is a fake.Just took it to the salon to compare with what they had there and it is DEFINITELY not the same product.Buyers beware!!
"
"
Could tell no difference in my hair using this product.
"
"
Deva curl products make my scalp very itchy.
"
"
The conditioner works really well,  I recommend.
"
"
Unsure if this what the real deal as a result from buying a salon brand off of the internet but I have noticed a little more defined curls.
"
"
The smell is way too strong- I wanted to overlook that if it worked great but I don't think it really did much for my hair. I gave it away.
"
"
Very light conditioner good for type 2 hairs
"
"
I like the smell of the regular One Condition better. This one is very strong but it doesn't weigh my hair down as much.
"
"
I love this conditioner - it is so light and makes my hair bouncier. Too bad the dispenser pump came damaged :(
"
"
Love DevaCurl! They understand my hair
"
"
Love it!  Helps tame the frizz and define the curls.
"
"
but it doesn't wait my hair down as much.
"
"
Devacurl has saved my curls! Feel so confident with my curls now!
"
"
Love DevaCurl, came packaged well
"
"
The conditioner my wife received is not an original. The odor that came with it was unberable. She had to return it after one use.
"
"
Nothing beats Devacurl. Nothing.
"
"
I've used Deva products before, but I was beyond PUMPED to see they had released a wavy hair line. I float between 2B/2C hair, and sometimes it's closer to an A (which is annoying), but this conditioner isn't too heavy for my textured, yet fine hair. It doesn't weigh it down the way some conditioners do, but it moisturizes nicely. I leave a little bit of it in when rinsing to fight frizz, but it leaves my hair so soft and happy that it almost isn't necessary (especially when you use the coconut curl super cream). I am definitely buying again!!
"
"
Love this stuff! Makes my wavy hair curlier without being crunchy. Nice smell, too.
"
"
Love love love. Deva curl is the best and this one has a scent that is Divine.
"
"
Since I have been using this, my curls are so beautiful
"
"
This product is fake. Smells nothing like my other DivaCurl products. It came leaking as well.
"
"
Love this conditioner my hair is so soft and not frizzy.
"
"
Amazing
"
"
Horrible.  Left my hair frizzy and oily. Will never waste my money on this wavy line again
"
"
Leaves my hair shiny nd curly without the weight. It smells delicious also.
"
"
Second time buying.  Def worth it if you have curly hair
"
"
Great product and great service
"
"
I received the product in good condition
"
"
Makes my hair curl and smells great!!!
"
"
I find it quite good
"
"
Life changer for wavy girls!
"
"
Product delivered as asvertised
"
"
It does the job.  I like the original one condition better, though.
"
"
!!!!? What
"
"
Was better when I used it few years ago. Probably have to switch to something else
"
"
Pros: Worked well with defining my curls and easy to run my fingers through hair while applying it in the shower.Cons: Overpowering scent & caused my sensitive skin to break out along my forehead, jawline, chin, etc. of where my hair came into contact with. I got a headache every time I used this.Unfortunately, I cannot continue to use this product and it's past the window for a refund. I hope DevaCurl will make this without fragrance someday.
"
"
I love the Deva curl line. Most of the products work great for my 2b hair. I'm so glad they came out with a lighter weight conditioner. The only thing to keep in mind, at least for me, is that their products take longer to rinse out.
"
"
It's not just the label that has changed, this is a new formula.  I've been using DevaCurl products for years and I've always loved the smell, especially of the conditioner.  While I don't find it offensive in this version like some others do, I prefer the previous scent.  Other than that, it seems to perform similarly to the old formula.
"
"
Great product for wavy hair! Fast easy transaction!!
"
"
This is good for naturally wavy to curly hair.
"
"
The conditioner seems to work okay on my hair, but it smelled SO SO SO bad. It's okay about 1 second and then the undertones of vomit hit.  I have to hold my breath to use it, but I paid a lot of money for this product so I'm going to force myself to get through the bottle. I haven't liked the smell of the newest DevaCurl products, but this one was the worst.
"
"
This stuff is terrible. It leaves my hair frizzy and burns my scalp. I was looking for something more cleansing then the No Poo but this is not it.
"
"
SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER:I got this product as part of the Wavy Mini Transformation Kit.  It includes the Low-Poo Delight, One Condition Delight, and Wave Maker, a styling mousse-cream.  I'm happy I had the opportunity to try out mini sizes of all three for only $12, because although I really wanted to love these products, I was largely dissatisfied.  (Also because it seems like some Amazon sellers sell knockoffs, and I know I got the real thing at an Ulta store, even if I didn't quite like it.)I have low porosity, fine, 2a/b/c hair, and a straight bottom layer.  I have oily roots, having to wash my hair every 2 days (stretch it to 3 once a week with a scalp cleanser), but the ends can get pretty dry once it's time for me to wash again.  While I used to always use a sulfate shampoo, I now use one only once weekly.  I do not include silicones in my hair routine, except for the occasional hair serum.  Therefore, I was pleased that the shampoo, conditioner, and styling product were sulfate- and silicone-free.SHAMPOO:When DevaCurl says ""Low-Poo"", they really mean it.  Because the Low-Poo Delight lathered so little, I felt like it was difficult to spread onto my scalp and that I had to use so much of it, not exactly what I want to do with the most expensive hair product brand I've ever purchased.  I have a cheap little shampoo brush from Sally's that I use for every wash.  Without that thing, there's no way this shampoo would clean my hair nearly enough.  In fact, I washed my hair with Johnson's Baby Shampoo once a few months ago, and it had the same issue with almost no lather, just for comparison.  Both have a fresh scent, but the DevaCurl Low-Poo Delight has a water lily scent, noticeably different from the Johnson's.The interesting thing about this shampoo is that when I wash with it, it makes my hair feel like the water is being all sealed in, the same way my hair feels when I use an oil-based deep conditioner such as the ORS Olive Oil Replenishing Pak.  I may like this for a conditioner, but not quite for a shampoo, considering that I have oily roots.  (While I don't like for my roots/scalp to be dry, which rarely happens anyway, too much moisture there makes it get oily faster.)As for how my hair looks after using both the shampoo and conditioner, I've tried them multiple times, in different weather conditions, and my hair has never come out looking as good as it does with my other shampoos and conditioners, even though my post-wash routine is generally the same.  The very first time using them both, I styled my hair with the Wave Maker, and while my hair looked amazing for a few hours after washing, for the next two days, the waves/curls were looser than usual, and I suppose it was the glycerin that caused it to frizz up a bit.  Other times I have used them, with the Wave Maker or other stylers, I've gotten frizzy hair and/or limp waves.  I do not use these products when I want my hair to look good, which is quite unfortunate considering DevaCurl's great reputation...and price tag.If I wanted a shampoo that hardly lathered that I had to use a ton of to properly cleanse my scalp, and left my waves looking anemic, I might as well buy Johnson's Baby Shampoo for a third of the cost per ounce.CONDITIONER:I did not find a single thing about this conditioner that stood out to me.  It had a nice, fresh, water lily scent.  The consistency was not too runny and not all that thick, but slip is more important to me than how thin or thick the product is, and the slip was not as good as that of other conditioners I've used, even cheap ones like Suave.  There are some conditioners that are so good that I don't even need to use a leave-in afterwards, but I for sure need one after using the One Condition Delight.I find it odd that the shampoo in this line holds in so much moisture from the water in my hair, whereas it's usually conditioner that I would think should do that.  I did not particularly feel that this conditioner was holding in any water or moisture.  However, the combination of the shampoo and conditioner, unfortunately, made my waves/curls looser than usual at best, and frizzy or limp at worst.  I'm wondering if all the glycerin could be the problem.No other shampoo or conditioner I have gives me the problems that these two Delight ones give me.  Sadly, they were not a ""delight"" for me.  In fact, while this brand has a great reputation, I find that I can't wait to use another shampoo and conditioner once it's time for my next wash.I may try the No-Poo Original and One Condition Original.  I'm a little worried that a no-poo may make my scalp oily, but I would think that the conditioner would at least be better for my ends.
"
"
I bought this since my hair is wavy rather than curly and it was suggested so as not to weigh down my hair. However, the more I used this, the more my hair felt like straw. The ends look dry and when I comb through my hair it always gets stuck. I think I am going to try the Original or Decadence.
"
"
I have fine and super curly hair. Normally anything slightly heavy or ""moisturizing"" weighs my hair down so much and makes it oily. This allows my curls go spring up and be what they need to be....no gel or any other product. Picture is literally after sleeping on it with no satin pillowcase, no pineappling, nothing. Just a little conditioner added in.The packaging was a little defunked. It leaked in the box about the size of a silver dollar. The top was lose and not enough padding.
"
"
This conditioner is okay, but not the holy grail it is made out to be for my hair.My hair is wavy, and I wanted to try something specifically geared for that. I started using this with another brand of shampoo that I had, as my conditioner ran out first. This conditioner didn't condition my hair as well as my previous conditioner (Acure Organics brand). It didn't moisturize as well and left it more difficult to brush through afterwards. I had to rub Argan oil into it just to make it feel more moisturized and allow for better combing. If a conditioner leaves me needing to add a bunch of other products in to actually moisturize or condition and make it manageable, then the conditioner has failed the grade.Once I started using the matching DevaCurl shampoo with it, the state of my hair deteriorated even more. Between the two, my hair is certainly weightless, but by that I mean that it is a poofy fluff mess, akin to having sheep's wool roving on my head. It is hard to comb or brush through, and I hate the way it looks. The shampoo was a smaller bottle, thankfully, but it will be going into the trash can, as much as is hurts to bin $17 of haircare product. As for the conditioner, I haven't decided if I'll keep using it, or if I may try it on my toddler son, whose hair is so short that ultimately it doesn't matter as much if it doesn't work as well.I am going back to Acure, where the prices are better, the products are also free of sulfates and other undesirable chemicals, and where my hair feels and looks nicer.
"
"
My hair hated this. I have 2b-3a curls and this left my hair frizzy, matted sticky and weirdly stiff. My hair is highly porous, finely distributed and individual strands are medium to fine. I even tried skipping this as a conditioner/leave in, and used just 1 pump to about six ounces of water in a spray bottle as a refresh, but I got the same abysmal results, wrecking what would have been great second day . It’s possible this didn’t work due to protein overload when added to my other product lineup (suave naturals coconut and eco argan oil) and the scent was strong but not terrible, but at the end of the day this costs too much to be completely unusable for my hair. It will be returned.In replacing this though, I think I may have found a winning routine for my hair - and I’m sharing this for any curlies like me. Cowash with suave naturals, rake in an actual dime size amount of Cantu curl activator cream (which I tried for the first time with this product bombed) and then shake and rake in gobs and gobs of eco argan gel. T-shirt plop and diffuse. I had the best hair day of my life, and as a major bonus the product were affordable.Good luck fellow curlies! Figuring out our hair costs dollars and days, but it feels so empowering and beautifying to find what works and know that no one else has a head of hair just like ours!
"
"
I'm actually pretty impressed with this conditioner. I was expecting not to like it because most lightweight conditioners aren't nearly enough for me. I've actually tried numerous times to find a lighter conditioner because the heavy ones weigh my hair down so much I have straight hair and my natural waves can't come through, but it never works and I always end up with just frizz and tangles, but this time I'm happy I finally found one! I haven't tried this with the Deva shampoo yet, but my normal shampoo is sulfate free. Will definitely keep using this product and hopefully the low poo shampoo will add even more oomf to my waves but so far I'm happy with the bounce I got back and my hair is soft and smooth! I will say it's a little pricey and the scent that is in all the Deva products is very strong. It smells exactly like this trashy Paris Hilton glitter body spray/perfume I used to use as a teenager so I like it for the nostalgia but it's definitely not what I would have liked. I wish they would switch to natural essential oils or offer a no fragrance option like Jessiecurl does.

I wish I had found this stuff sooner in life!  I have fine, thin, medium length hair that has some natural wave when I air dry, but can easily be blown out straight as well.  My hair is extremely prone to build up and looking weighted down and flat.  So much so, that I normally do not use a conditioner at all until the winter months when static makes it necessary.This DevaCurl One Condition Delight is truly weightless, and I have tried every conditioner that makes that weightless claim - but this is the only one that actually lives up to it!  My hair is so soft, shiny, full of body, with absolutely zero weight down or build up.  I won't ever be without it.I love that it is silicone free.  I can easily go 2-3 days without washing and my hair still looks freshly washed, which is really saying something for my ""prone to buildup hair"".  With any other conditioner, washing every single day is a must for me.Also, this conditioner is made for wavy hair, which I do have, and it works great when I air dry and leave my hair wavy.  But I use this when I blow my hair out straight also, and it works just as amazing for straight hair!  So straight, wavy, or curly my hair loves this stuff!

I have bought Devacurl products from amazon and directly from deva curl and never had any problems with them. THey all seemed to look, smell, and work the same. However, I bought this Devacurl product on amazon (after buying it several times directly from devacurl) and it burned my scalp. It burned badly and a few days later, all the skin peeled off my scalp. My doctor said it looked like a chemical burn or severe contact dermatitis and to not use it again.  I just received a new bottle that I bought directly from DevaCurl and used it last night with no problem at all. THere is definitely something wrong with this product. It may be fake or have something added to it, I don't know. I definitely won't use it again.
"

If you're looking for a new conditioner, and you've got frizz-prone, wavy hair, this is going to be your new bestie.  Leave it on for 5 minutes while you finish your shower, rinse in cold water, gently squeeze out extra water, put in some devacurl light gel, scrunch, and don't touch your hair until it's dry. You will love the difference.
"
"
This conditioner is very lightweight and does moisturize pretty well for not being a heavy conditioner. The scent is something between a reeking chemical jasmine smell and a nice jasmine scent. Odd, I know, but that's the best way I can describe it. So would I purchase it again? Yes - except...apparently I am allergic to the conditioner. Every time I use it my scalp itches for a full day afterward. I have a healthy scalp; I've never had an allergy to a hair product before. But I won't be re-purchasing DevaCurl One because I don't like to have a miserably itchy scalp.
"
"
I love this with the entire DevaCurl Delight line. It is light and moisturizing and I have less build-up with it which means I use my clarifying cleanser less. When I want extra moisture I will use my Coconut Asiam cowash in between washes, which is affordable and available to purchase at most drug stores. I will repurchase again and the investment for a 32oz bottle was worth it. However, purchase it through Amazon for cheaper options rather than at the local high end beauty stores as they are more expensive. Here you can get the same product for a fraction of the price.
"
"
I won't say this isn't the real thing made by Deva, but I will say it is the worst thing so far that I have purchased from them. To make matters worse, I took it on a three-week trip without trying it first. Big mistake and won't do that again. For me, this is a terrible product: my hair was dry feeling, had no shine. Ick. I do NOT recommend this product.
"
"
Very unhappy with this product. I liked devacurls other products, and assumed that since I have wavy hair that I could trust that this would work for my hair. Instead of moisturizing, it just sits on top of my hair and makes it gunky. I’ve tried warm water, cold water, different amounts of conditioner and all have horrible results where my hair is a frizzy mess, or lifeless and greasy looking.
"
"
This conditioner made my hair terrible. It gave me frizzy hair when wet and dryness. There is something wrong with it.I wish I could return this product. I used it twice and now I'm throwing it out.
"
"
I have thinner extra curly hair.  I purchased this because i could not see paying twice as much for the stuff that is actually for curly hair.  I am SO glad i purchased this!!  It works so much better on my hair!!
"
"
This conditioner is my favorite in the world. I have 3b curly hair. It’s light, moisturizing, softening, amazing. Whenever I run out, I am freaking out. I always keep an extra bottle in stock now. Highly recommend!!!!!!!!!
"
"
This product is amazing.  I use it as a regular conditioner but also use a little dab as a leave in conditioner.  The feel is light. And the smell is so pretty.  Love it!!
"
"
Love the fact that this is silicone free - that's hard to find.  This is the perfect consistency.  It doesn't weigh down my hair but conditions well.
"
"
This conditioner is a lighter weight than the Deva Decadence conditioner.  I think it's perfect for summer.  Not heavy or sticky.  I'll go back to Decadence in the winter when the air is more dry.  Smells great, too.
"
"
Tried it since there are now 3 kinds. It is good, just not enough conditioning for my hair but a friend loves it since the old formula was too heavy.
"
"
I have been using this conditioner for a while now and this is definitely the best price I've seen it listed for. I have wavy hair that is very oily so this formula works great for me. It makes my hair voluminous without drying it out and helps to control my oil so I don't have to shampoo as often.
"
"
This leave on conditioner is all I’ll use on my curly hair, it is totally unmanageable each morning until I apply the conditioner. It also takes very little so it last a long time.
"
"
I love DevaCurl conditioner so I was happy to find it on amazon!
"
"
The pump on the bottle broke immediately. There is a crack somewhere on the inside.
"
"
Hair is a greasy mess after washing 2 more times with no poo! I have thick Wavy hair and this made it poofy not Wavy the first day. Now I can't seem to wash it out. Do not try this if you have thick hair or one condition works at all for you.
"
"
My fave combo is the Deluxe DevaCurl shampoo with this One Condition comditioner, I’m unsure why but I always have a pretty good hair day.
"
"
This has a very strong perfume scent,  nothing like the original.  It works fine in my hair but I don't like how strong the smell is!
"
"
Great for permed hair
"
"
I agree with other reviewers that the smell isn't as enjoyable s it used to be. I actually wish they offered some fragrance free options.
"
"
Good product for curly hair
"
"
Good for dry hair
"
"
The bottle was opened and leaking when it arrived.
"
"
I really like this conditioner. It helps keep my curls chunky instead of frizzy. I'm able to comb my hair after using this product. I had to rip through it with regular conditioner. The scent is over-powering out of the bottle tho. Like a guy wearing too much cologne.
"
"
Only need a teeny bit. Good stuff! Works!
"
"
Love the volume I get when I use any DevaCurl products!
"
"
Still the best line of hair products for curly hair that I've ever used.
"
"
Worked as advertised.  Came in a timely fashion.  😊
"
"
Whoa! I love the smell of the new Delight products better than the original!!!
"
"
This is my go to conditioner and has been for almost two years now. It’s great as a detangler and moisturizer.
"
"
It came very quickly. My hair loves it!
"
"
I love this conditioner!! It's lightweight enough to not be greasy, and hydrating enough to keep away frizz.
"
"
My hair gets wavy and frizzy in the warm humid weather. Using this product gave me great waves and controlled the frizz. I watching the video was very helpful. I now have a solution for my summer hair.
"
"
This conditioner is amazing! And it truly is weightless
"
"
fast delivery. will defiantly order again
"
"
Works best on very dry hair
"
"
Love the devacurl products. Does wonders for my wavy hair!
"
"
Great product
"
"
as described.
"
"
Don't like the smell of this product.  Will switch back to the original onecondition.
"
"
Have used it for years,,works great!
"
"
I have fine, wavy/loose curly hair. I have tried the Original, Decadence, and now DeLight Deva conditioners and this one is surely the most weightless on my hair. It gave my curls more bounce and no greasy feel. Some other reviews complain about the smell, which I was hesitant about, but the conditioner doesn't have a fragrance; it just smells like soap, which is fine by me as I am not a fan of added fragrance in my products.
"
"
Works for my hair type. Make my curls bouncy.
"
"
my go to conditioner for curly days!
"
"
Good price for this product and arrived on a timely basis! Will order again!
"
"
LOVE THIS!!! I find it to be more moisturizing than all the other devacurl conditioners. Weightless, did leave my frizzy hair frizz free, very nice and smoothing. Just the best ever. Nice scent too. I bought this at another store not on Amazon. Love love love.
"
"
Love this so much.  Smells good and really helps my dry damaged hair! I use it with the no poo wash and my hair hasn't felt this healthy in years.
"
"
If I am going to wear my long hair curly, I HAVE to use this.  I once had a brilliant stylist tell me the best way to use it. Use Frizz-Free in the shower.  When your conditioner is still in, comb through your hair.  Rinse out the conditioner, then bend your head so the hair falls in front of you, and while wet, pump the Frizz-Free into your hands, and scrunch into your hair, starting at the ends.  Then gently wrap hair in a towel for 5 minutes.  Unwrap hair, and put into place with fingers.  Then use the DevaCurl Supercream Coconut Curl Styler -- it's the perfect partner to Frizz-Free.  Just a few pumps throughout hair.  Then let dry naturally.  Another trick is to NOT touch it until it is completely dry; this helps make it frizz resistant.  When totally dry, bend head forward, and gently fluff hair until it's as full as you want.  It leaves my hair shiny, curly, and mostly frizz free.  The best combo ever!
"
"
I received a knockoff that was slightly smaller than the original bottle, with different packaging and formula. The original DevaCurl foam has a sweet smell and the product I received smelled overwhelmingly like alcohol. Be careful!
"
"
I have fine hair that is easily weighed down.  After shampooing and conditioning (DevaCurl No-Poo and OneCondition), I scrunch this lightweight foam through my hair and dry most of the way with a diffuser.  Then, I put clips in to lift the roots while air-drying, for 15-20 minutes.  Works great!  On day 2, my hair ""springs back"" by misting it with water and letting it air dry.  Using heat to dry on day 1 with this product is essential for my hair.  Love how it is cruelty-free, has a light scent, and lasts a long time.
"
"
I have fine, 3A hair, and I've always had a hard time finding product that has good hold but doesn't weigh my hair down or make it stick to my head. The last time I got my hair cut, my stylist recommend I try mousse instead of gel. I've been using Deva products for four or five years, and decided to try this one.Overall, it works really well. I get good definition without all the crunchiness, flakiness, and weighed-down-iness that comes from using gel. My hair also looks good 2-3 days later, which was not the case when I was mainly relying on gel.My only complaint is that the plunger apparatus isn't very sturdy. I'm not sure if it was defective, I was pumping it too aggressively (phrasing!), or the tiny, furry terrorist who lives with me knocked it off the counter too many times, but it stopped working correctly about halfway through the bottle. The product stopped foaming out the way it's supposed to; a lot of the liquid leaked out of the bottom of the plunger. and was unusable.  Unfortunate, considering how expensive this stuff is.I like the product so much that I am buying it again, and hoping that the plunger issue was a one-off.
"
"
I buy this direct from DevaCurl and it smells NOTHING like what I received when I ordered from this group. It looks like they took a real DevaCurl bottle which was empty and filled it with who knows what (smells like ammonia cleaner), then sold it for cheap. I know better now and will only buy directly from the manufacturer from now on. I used it once thinking maybe they changed the formula and it smelled different. WRONG!! My hair looked horrible after using this, nothing like it does when I use REAL DevaCurl products. That's also how I knew something was fishy. I went to Ulta and bought a brand new bottle, opened it and it smelled just like it should. I have no idea what I put on my hair from what I bought on Amazon, but thankfully no long-term damage was done.
"
"
Maybe the DevaCurl line was too hyped up for me, but I finally caved and bought this $20 mousse. It did not live up to my expectations. I was expecting some lift, but all it does is crunch and there is no extra lift whatsoever. I much prefer the Miss Jessies line for my hair. Good luck, ladies!
"
"
I really like this foam performance wise. It's forgiving - I don't have to worry about using a precise amount or fear having too stiff or too frizzy hair. It makes my loose curls look great. There are some issues though. I do feel like I get an unusual amount of buildup when I use this. Also, the pump ends up dying on me if I don't use it for a few weeks. I'm trying something else for a while but would go back if this new stuff doesn't work out.
"
"
Makes my hair heavy and gross-feeling. Very obvious when I have product in. Didn't help tame frizz either.I have thick wavy hair, 3a/3c.
"
"
I love this product but the one I received is a knock off.  Buyer beware!!!  Normally when I use this product it gives me curl definition but the bottle I received from amazon did nothing for my hair.  It’s as if I used nothing at all.  I will not buy from amazing again.
"
"
I love this product and it is cheaper here than it is at Ulta. I apply to my roots while my hair is wet and air dry because I prefer a more natural look. It is a very light, foamy formula and doesn’t make my hair sticky or leave any residue. I actually used one bottle of the product and didn’t repurchase for about a month simply to try and save some money. I really underestimated how much volume it was giving my hair and ending up ordering another bottle. I pair it with the weightless waves cream

This stuff is great! Really helps to add volume to the crown (top) area of my hair. I have medium length curls, and a lot of different curl patterns, so certain ares tend to be weighed down and/or not as curly. Because of this foam my curls look great all day! Important fact: Mix with Ultra-Defining Gel! I do a pump of the gel mixed with 2 pumps of the foam, applying both to sopping wet hair right out of the shower, scrunch, and DO NOT TOUCH until dry. It will feel crunchy, but all you have to do is flip your hair over, scrunch to break the casting of the gel, and viola! Perfect, shiny, healthy curls all day long!
"
"
I love this product.  It works and is worth using on hair that needs more volume.  My hair thinned because of medication and you would never be able to tell because of this product and the Be leave in by Deva Curl.
"
"
One of my favorite curly hair products!  This foam saturates the hair and helps bring out more of my curl pattern.  Plus it provides a light, flexible hold.  I stopped using it for a couple of years because of the price, but my hair looks so much better with it. So happy I found it on Amazon Prime!
"
"
I like this much better than the gel. I think it comes out less scrunchy and my hair is more work-able. I just started using it with a microfiber towel vs cotton and it was a game changer.
"
"
I have 3b curly hair, and this is the only product I've found that will keep the frizz under control. I live in the South and can't avoid frizz on those humid summer days, but DevaCurl foam helps keep the frizz to the greatest minimum possible. The foam smells nice and doesn't leave your hair feeling crunchy. I've tried loads of drugstore-brand curly hair products. Deva is expensive but worth the cost for the great results.
"
"
Scent is too strong, product is somewhat effective, just can't tolerate the scent.
"
"
I am totally pleased with this product. With other styling products my short hair flattens on the top when wet. With this foam my hair gets more height in addition to more volume in general. My curls refresh nicely the next day with a water spritz. I have to be careful to apply the foam sparingly; it seems pretty concentrated. So far, no frizz after being on the water and after being outside on a drizzly day. Also, there's no lingering fragrance unlike with some of the other DevaCurl products. I'm going to give away my styling gels. This foam is the best!
"
"
I like this product.  I have naturally curly hair and this is one of the first products that actually keeps the frizz halo at bay.  I use the Deva Curl gel followed by 2 to 3 pumps of this. . .USE sparingly!  I'm still playing with my hair ""cocktail"" in the a.m.; however, this is definitely one of the products that I'll continue to use.
"
"
I love this product! I love the way it feels and smells in my hair! Does everything it says it does! Worth every $!
"
"
Defined my curls nicely with very little frizz
"
"
Great for volume but flakes badly.
"
"
love it, use it daily
"
"
Excellent! Defined curls with big body bounce.  My hair feels soft all day.  It wasn't sticky or crunchy.  I've tried many different combinations of products.  This with kenra curl creme is pretty bomb.
"
"
My hole grail curl product! Super light weight!
"
"
Great
"
"
when bottle pumped only liquid came out and not foam . I shook bottle before i used it . Would not ever buy this product again . Not worth the money .
"
"
This is an essential product during this summer's horrible humidity throughout the South.
"
"
Absolutely love this product. Will purchase again
"
"
I wasn't too excited about this once I saw the ingredients. But I have fine, 3b curls and often a curly mousse is the only thing that works for me. If I use a gel it has to be very lightweight. Creams are too heavy for my hair, it weighs it down and makes it greasy. So I was hopeful, but then I saw the ingredients. The first time I used it my hair look good, but if you touch your hair near the scalp it was thick and almost sticky but more dry than sticky. On second day, it's almost like it gets worse, the hair gets soooo thick and sticky I swear you could start dreads with this stuff.So disappointed after spending this money, I don't have a lot of money to waste.Fortunately I also ordered a small size of the spray gel and that seems to be working better for my hair. I can't see how anyone could like this unless they do their hair in a beehive, or something really big. I need volume and frizz control, not glue in my hair. Flakey too.
"
"
I use this for my baby girls hair in the summer.  Keeps her curls fresh looking and bouncy.  I'm the father of a bi-racial child and until I found out the Deva Curl products, I had used everything under the sun but wasn't really ever satisfied.  Definitely worth it, I only wish that the price of the products were a little more reasonable.  You can easily spend over $100-$150 to get the various products to use for your hair easily,  and for a 10 year old that is a bit expensive especially I can only imagine what it will cost as she gets older and her hair gets longer...
"
"
Sticky strong almost like gel
"
"
This volumizing foam was easy to use and had a wonderful fragrance. It added volume and structure to my curly hair. I will certainly buy this again.
"
"
Unfortunately this did not work as well for me as it did other reviewers.
"
"
I used this for the first time on my curly permed hair. I used it before ""plopping"" my hair overnight and my hair came out wonderful! It's soft, frizz free and full of volume. I will be continuing to use this product for my first day hair!
"
"
Only product that works on my hair.  Doesn't weight my curls down, defines them well, holds up to humidity, and allows for perfect second day hair.  I have extremely curly hair and so far have been very happy with this product.
"
"
I've used this stuff for a while now and just love it. I definitely notice a difference in hair volume when I don't use it. The bigger the hair the better I say. It does go fast, though...I have curls just past my shoulders and I use about 6-7 pumps every morning. So maybe get 2 bottles at once :)
"
"
no lid, liquid missing, must have been a used and returned item
"
"
Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!! I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time. I have recommended this products to all my curly-haired friend. So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...DevaCurl or DevaCare is it!!
"
"
I'm a huge fan of the devacurl products and use them regularly. But I have to give this one a pass. This is the first time using a devacurl product that my hair came out limp, greasy, and heavy with product. So disappointing! I couldn't wait to wash it out. I'll stick with the arc anGEL, which has never let me down.
"
"
Good. Go to YouTube for videos of their products (that's what I did). Not all if them go together, however. When I use this I don't used the gel.
"
"
This is really awesome.  I have fine, thin hair that is sparse on top.  This makes my hair look thicker, stays in place and even holds a ""comb over"" to cover the bare spots.
"
"
I've used lot's of curl enhancers. This was not extraordinarily good. You can probably find a cheaper product that works just as well.
"
"
Tames the frizzies.  Some people say it leaves the hair sticky.  Those people don't know how to use the product and probably put it on dry hair.  Probably the same kind of people who want to speak to your supervisor.
"
"
love what this product does for my wavy hair.
"
"
I have shoulder length s-wavy hair (yes... this puts  me at the bottom of the Deva Curl Food Chain ;) and LOVE this Foam for the extra volume and curl I need.I use this after the gel and my first micro-towel scrunch.  Then I scrunch this in my hair when it's still wet - and walk out the door.  When I get to work (I have a 45 minute commute) my hair is almost dry.  I flip my hair upside down and do a few more scrunches to 'break the crunch cap"" and quickly finger comb my hair.My hair then is soft, bouncy and full of wave and body.I use the gel because it is part of the whole process but honestly, the foam is my favorite product and what gives me the best bouncy waves and polishes my look.
"
"
Does NOT weight down my hair! I have tons of fine curly hairs, and this takes it without pulling my curls down. I've used several Deva Curl products,  and this is my favorite.
"
"
This product is fantastic because it is very light and leaves my curls frizz free, bouncy, and light!
"
"
Great product to tame the frizz on my curly hair. I mix it with the Deva curl gel
"
"
I am a committed Deva Curl Girl. Swear by the products. However, I don't think that this works as well as the gel, and it's much more expensive.
"
"
I have 2C/3A curls medium length thin, fine hair and I have moved to a tropical humid climate.  Frizz and dullness has always been a problem.  This foam, leaves my hair feeling soft, FRIZZ FREE, incredibly shiny even in this humidity. And it does add volume! :)  I can have day 3 hair with this product without adding anymore product to my hair. I just spritz my hair with water, to re-shape my curls and I am done.  I scrunch in the foam when my hair is dripping soaking wet and I scrunch out the excess water with a micro fiber towel and let it air dry.  I am definitely going to re-purchase this.  I have thrown out all of my heavy hold gels and mousses.  Yes, it is pricey at over $21 a bottle but I only use 5 pumps of this in my hair every time I wash it and that's all I need.  Less is more with this product.  This bottle will probably last me more than 4 months.  The inside is liquid and the product dispenses as a foam.  If you're thinking about buying this...do it.  Your curls will thank you for it.
"
"
I like this product because it gives my curls body but not unnecessary fluff.
"
"
I have fine & thin curly hair . This volumizing foam is incredible! My hair has never looked so full!!
"
"
Works great and smells good too! This foam doesn't weigh my curls down and really works well. It provides my curls with a boost of volume without the crunchy hard feeling. I love it!
"
"
The product came on time and as described. I am glad I bought this!  I always research before I buy and this was a good deal.
"
"
Light weight, adds volume, and mess free! No residue!
"
"
Perfect for taming my graying, frizzy hair. Even my hair stylist loves it.
"
"
Fantastic! Spray. Scrunch. Diffuse.

I use this product everyday on my 3B fine naturally curly hair. I put one pump in my palm along with one pump of DevaCurl Styling cream and nickle sized amount of DevaCurl Light Defining gel and mix the three together and scrunch at the roots and at the ends. Cuts down on the frizz and defines curls.
"
"
If you have curly hair, this is the only product to use.  It is easy and keeps your curls looking AMAZING!!!
"
"
Gives my fine hair a ton of volume and defines my curls. By far my fave curl product!!
"
"
It has no hold what so ever. Don't purchase. I've used other Deva products with success, but this isn't worth anything.
"
"
A little on the pricey side but this stuff is great!!
"
"
Smells Great! Helps with frizz control.
"
"
Still gets a little frizzy
"
"
I like this product for adding some volume. I don't know that it is a lot of volume, but some is OK. I am afraid to add some other product for volume because I do not want to ruin the Deva system by putting something else in my hair.  It doesn't ruin the feel of my hair if I put it on as directed, when my hair is still damp, but I have forgotten to put it on and tried some on my hair after it is dry. N/G. It makes your hair feel awful.It's now several months later and I'm updating this review. I bought some B'Leave-In for the same purpose as this product(control and volume). It is much better. My hair is soft and curly. I put a little extra at the crown of my head where my hair is extra dry and is softens it up. I use it after gel.
"
"
I have Curlygirl / Naturallycurly Type 2C hair and this is one of the tools in my kit. Very nice. Works exactly the way they describe it. Not too sticky and just enough definition. I live on the wetcoast and find I use this on wet rainy days.
"
"
I am new to this product.  I like how little you use and how well it separates my curls.  Does feel a little more drying than the curl cream I was using before.  Don't know yet if I love it.
"
"
Pretty good product, very light weight, keeps my curls defined.
"
"
I use it all the time; it definitely brings out the curl in my hair.
"
"
Trying this product for the first time. Really like it. My curls are not as frizzy and seem to have more bounce.
"
"
This is the best product I have found to keep the curls in all day.It leaves the hair soft and natural. It is not heavy . It worked for me and I would say it is worth a try.I have been using it for ninemonths and still awesome.....The real trick is only use a smallamount........
"
"
I've enjoyed using this foam and the bottle lasted quite a bit longer than I anticipated. It doesn't weigh down your hair, though it doesn't have quite as much hold as a gel. I was very happy with the frizz control on most days.
"
"
Smells amazing! It also is not too heavy so my hair doesn't look greasy or wet.
"
"
Really controls frizz.  My hair is now full and soft and curly and NOT frizzy.  The other DevaCurl products I've tried have all been great, too.
"
"
Received with excitement by curly headed granddaughter.
"
"
Excellent product for coarse frizzy hair
"
"
Really like this product. A little goes a long way!
"
"
Works very well at controlling frizz and increases curl retinsion while leaving curls soft and touchable.
"
"
Perfect for taming my daughters frizzies from her beautiful curls. This takes and gentle sculpts curls
"
"
I love this product, it's not sticky and works great on wet naturally curly hair.
"
"
It's pricey, but I'm in love.  Great product!  And I love that you can pour the last few drops into your next bottle so you are not wasting any!
"
"
Love this product
"
"
It looks like was used.
"
"
I guessed it was a marketing hype...Deva, haha. But it works better than anything I have been using. It's light and doesn't pull your hair down. My new favorite curl enhancer.
"
"
My daughter uses this. Thick Hispanic hair. She loves how it controls frizz!
"
"
I have very long curly 3A hair. I bought 3 deva products at once because I love Aveda straightening line (it works awesome for curls) but it's just too expensive for daily use. After using the deva for a month, I can say this foam is my least favorite. I found it too sticky and my hair is crunchier then I expected (from the reviews), plus it made my curls flat but I do only air dry my hair so that may be why. That being said I LOVE the creme which holds my curls without any heavy feeling or residue. I also love the coconut curl styler which I use on day 2 to rejuvenate my curls, which I really didn't think would work, but it really does.
"
"
I love this foam, it works for my hair a lot nicer than the ""AnGel"" light hold styling gel that I also have. That one works, but this one just seems to finish off better for me. Leaves my hair shiny and my curls more free.And it smells like Pez candy! Very nice.
"
"
Great product
"
"
I'm extremely disappointed to write that this product makes my hair extremely frizzy. I've used all types of mousse in the past and many make my hair crunchy. I had high hopes for this product after I was referred to the Devacurl line. I'm extremely disappointed that this has made my hair look worse than any other hair product. I really wanted it to work!!
"
"
I have naturally curly, soft curly waves.  This product weighs them down and makes my hair sticky.  I would never buy again.  However, I really like the gel and the conditioner.
"
"
Works well, altho a bit messy if too much used
"
"
Crunchy
"
"
Only product I will use.  Love my curls now.
"
"
This was a great product...until the pump stopped working after the 3rd or 4th use.
"
"
arrived without cap
"
"
this wasn't what I thought I was ordering, but it works really well. no frizz and my hair isn't flat.
"
"
My hairdresser has curly hair also and when I asked what she uses this is what she recommended.  I use this combined with Deva Curl Set it free every morning and my curls have never been more awesome!  And if they do get a little wind blown I just add a little more water and it immediately resets.  No more frizzy days
"
"
I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls. I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren't any better than their cheaper counterparts. Don't waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products. Head to Target for the same type of shampoo, Frizz-Free stuff, gel & condition without bruising your credit card. My opinion only, but I've found better products for my curly hair at Ross', TJ Max and Marshalls. Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz. It's cheap & it works.
"
"
Great for light curls
"
"
Light but effective, a good go to for curly hair. Mine is permed and it works for me.
"
"
Not the best. In fact, my curls (type 3B) did better with Aussie brand mousse. My hair was dull and unmanageable with this mousse. It does, however, last quite a long time.
"
"
I love it.  Best product I have ever used.
"
"
this is my second order I love this product it's a must for frizzy curly hair.can't beat the price and the delivery is fast.
"
"
I have fine curly hair and I've tried all the Deva Curl products.  I do  mix it up with other Deva products too. I like using the volumizing gel for the top of my head and the foam for the sides. I use all the products but my favorite is the foam it works for my fine curly hair.
"
"
Love this stuff!  Helps to reactivate my curls and is not stiff or sticky on my hair
"
"
Great product at a great price!!😄 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS PRODUCT! Blessings to you Cheryl Van Gorder
"
"
I really like this product line, but it leaves residue in my hair. I am going to use it spearingly next time. But overall it works !
"
"
This was supposed to work like a frizz reducing mousse but it doesn't even feel or look like anything is on my hair.  Not impressed with this brand.
"
"
Great product - love it. I use it with a bit of defining curl gel to make my hair fuller.
"
"
I use Devacurl NoPoo, One Condition, and Devacurl Light Defining Gel, and wanted to try this mousse for extra volume. Unfortunately, I'm really disappointed. Even with just a small amount it made my hair so stiff! I'll just stick with the gel and flip my head upside down while diffusing for extra volume.
"
"
I have wavy hair, not curly. I thought this would leave my hair soft & take away some frizz. It's the exact opposite. Maybe it would work better on someone who actually has curly hair???
"
"
Not a fan of this mousse sadly. I'm trying to stick w the product line though.
"
"
A must for curly hair!
"
"
Not quite what I expected.
"
"
Great item!! Works just as described!
"
"
Great product... reordered it already!
"
"
A couple things - I always read reviews before purchasing, and this had enough good reviews so I went for it. It was also cheaper than Ouidad which is who I initially checked out. I liked that this was free of sulfate etc, as opposed to Ouidad. First - it smells SO delicious. I love it. I haven't ever smelled anything like it. My hair is really thin for my Hispanic descent which saddens me, so I was hoping this would help. So far, I used it once on second day hair, after wetting it with cold water (no shampooing or conditioning). It didn't do much. This morning after my shower, where I used L'Oreal's Evercurl sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, rinsing conditioner out with head flipped over under cold water, I dried my hair with a t-shirt and applied 4 pumps of this when it was a little more than damp, scrunching as I went. I diffused and had the front parts pinned up with clips for more volume. Again today, after taking it down from the pins, I did not notice a difference in volume and that is really what I was looking for. Overall, I like the way it makes my hair smell and feel, shiny with some sturdiness, and really no crunch. I will keep trying to get the voluminous result that I want, but now I am wondering if I should have gone with Ouidad.
"
"
Smell good but not pump up the volume as stated
"
"
Makes my hair looks gorgeous! Just have to keep scrunching it throughout the day.
"

I am a curly girl and have followed the method for awhile now. But I haven't purchased too many Deva products to date. I had some that I liked and I stuck with them for years. I do get a Deva cut. Since I turned a certain age my hair is changing. Feels finer, and it's really gotten thinner. So the products that have worked for me in the past aren't necessarily working well for me now. Most seem to heavy. So I wanted to try a mousse to see if it would bring back some of the body my hair used to have, and maybe encourage the curl a bit as well. This product does both of those things. It does have a kind of Skittle like smell to it, but I kind of like Skittles so it doesn't bother me at all but if you are sensitive to fragrance it may. I have also learned that more is not better, in fact if you use too much your hair feels kind of gummy.  UPDATE: 11/7/17  Of course now it 's outside of return time. The product itself remains very good. But the dispenser is broken. I had a couple issues with it in the beginning but thought it was fixed. Now when I depress the pump it all leaks out from the bottom of the pump and drips down the bottle and makes a huge mess. It's unusable and it was too expensive to not feel sick about throwing it away. I would love if a rep from the seller would contact me. I haven't used much of the bottle as I only shampoo 2-3 times a week and don't need much. I would love to exchange it for one that works.But the right amount gives me nicely defined curls, and when it's dry I turn my head upside down and shake to break up the cast and my hair is soft instead of stiff afterward. As for frizz free, well that is not true at least for me. I use it on top of another product to control the frizz. It is fine for 1 day hair, but I only shampoo every 3 days. Without my other product (Curl Keeper) underneath it's a frizzy mess. However if I want killer volume for one day it's perfect alone.I guess it's kind of versatile in that way. I don't need very much. Amazon has a good price for the item, though it is still pricey for a mousse. But it is free of sulfates and silicones and not tested on animals which is important to me. It will last me a good while.
"
"
Works great with curly hair and controls the frizz!
"
"
This product came faster than expected. I love Deva foam, it keeps my curls in place without making it hard and crunchy.
"
"
I did not see this product helping de-frizz or hold  shape.
"
"
no help for fine wavy hair
"
"
nice and light, very clean feel but good volume
"
"
This is great for fine hair! Works great on my thin hair.
"
"
I really like this stuff!  I have thin fine curls.  This product is a great volumizer, but very light, so I can use as much as I like without the curls being weighed down.  Glad I found this!
"
"
I love the foam, but the pump broke after 2 weeks. I recommend keeping your old pump so if it breaks, you can still utilize the product.
"
"
Lifts hair from the base yet doesn't weigh it down at all. I love Deva products for my curly hair!
"
"
I use DevaCare conditioners and thought this product would be great. Well I thought wrong...my hair looked nappy and ended up with massive tangles instead of defined curls. Then when I went to wash my hair it was like I couldn't wash it out !  I tried it twice in case the first time was a fluke. The only thing nice about this product is that it does smell good . I have already thrown it away so I won't be tempted to give it another try !
"
"
Purchased for my daughter
"
"
love this
"
"
Only had this for 4mo and no longer acts like a foam... Just water that comes out! Why is this happening?
"
"
Must have for anyone battling curly hair. :)
"
"
Nothing has ever worked so well on my hair.  I have fine straight hair and this gives it volume and has great holding power even on a very humid day in Florida.  And you would never know it was in your hair, no stickiness.
"
"
DevaCurl products are the best thing ever.  I have been using them exclusively for the past year and my curls have never looked better... they are frizz-free and bouncy.  I never knew my hair could look this good :)
"
"
Fabulous
"
"
Product delivered as advertised and on early! Thanks!
"
"
great product
"
"
Excellent product and shipped quickly! I ordered the shampoo and conditioner too so they all work well together.  I will order this product again.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
It had my hair bouncy but, there's a terrible white residue. Especially on the days you want to touch up, refresh your fro. It was bouncy it moved with the wind but the residue is not worth the cash.
"
"
Mrs W says this stuff really does the trick - no more frizz. Great stuff
"
"
This product works really well on my curly hair.  It keeps the frizz down and doesn't get real crunchy.
"
"
Makes my hair sticky.
"
"
This product was recommended to me by a hairstylist who specializes in cutting curly hair. With it, I truly do not need gel, mousse, or hair spray, and I live in humid San Antonio, TX. After conditioning in the shower, flip your hair upside down and put about 3-4 pumps of the product (my length is just past my shoulders) through your hair- (run hands along top of hair instead of putting your fingers through your hair). Once your hair is dried, you will not have that ""crunchy look"" and your hair will not have the look of too little product. I really did throw out all of the other bottles of product that I own. If you have thin, curly hair like me, I know you own at least a dozen. This stuff really works.
"
"
I have natural curly hair and its the first product that allows my curls to be defined and light and bouncy.It does not weigh down your hair.I would highly recommend this product.
"
"
Second time I purchased this product and the pump broke making the product not work. Waste of money.
"
"
Great product. Fast shipping
"
"
Don’t buy this product from amazon! I got this product from amazon and the first time I received it, it was great and the original product but the second time I received it, it smelt different and made my hair feel and be different. I could tell that it was not true diva curl. It actually smelt like self tanner! I tried to return it and because it’s hair product, you can’t. Just buy this from deva curl and skip buying it from amazon since you can’t return it! Such a let down.
"
"
My hair did not feel very soft and no volume at all I can't wait to finish it.
"
"
This foam works well for frizz, but it's too heavy for fine, curly hair.  It would be better for those with coarse, curly hair.
"
"
Leaves my hair crunchy, not curly.
"
"
This product is light and makes my curls tighter without any sticky residue. I use this with the no poo and conditioner.  Recommend this product to anyone with curly hair
"
"
This is by far the best product for curly hair!  I was already impressed with the other deva curl products, but this one is it.  My hair is soft, not crunchy and the curls are divine!  No frizz at all for two whole days, and I live in Houston, Texas so that is a miracle!  I think I can FINALLY toss out all my other products I have  collected over the years.
"
"
This is an amazing product for curly frizzy hair!! You don't need very much and it makes perfect ringlets!!
"
"
I love this product my hair just looks so alive when I put this in my hair so worth the cost ..... I recommend this to all curly haired girls (:
"
"
❤️
"
"
really keeps my curly hair from getting frizzy!
"
"
This product is amazing! Not only did I have curls that lasted for days, the volume it provided was incredible! For someone that has fine hair, this product was perfect. Just be sure you follow the instructions on scrunching, etc. Some great videos on YouTube as well.
"
"
I love this volumizing foam for my curls.  I use a lot of the devachan products for my VERY curly hair.  I find that this provides nice hold and is pleasant to put in my hair.  I do think the gel is better for humid, summer days though.
"
"
I really love the way this works on my hair, and only a little bit is needed. The company I bought it from has a great price also.
"
"
After only three uses the pump on the bottle stopped working! Will not order again and do not recommend this for others.
"
"
I get so many compliments on my curls since I started using this product.  No other product has helped to define my curls like DavaCurl does.  It's amazing!
"
"
Works great.
"
"
Love the foam. It definitely keeps my hair from frizzing... I will buy this again!!!
"
"
Great product-I love how it holds my curlsAnd keeps them soft. Delivery time was as promised.
"
"
Love it...
"
"
This works great on the first day. Curls/waves are great. But on the second day my hair is brittle and tangled at the end and I usually have to put it up or wash it again. I wish it lasted more than one day!
"
"
Love this product for my naturally frizzy/curly hair!
"
"
This product is good at holding the hair and reducing frizz, however I have to use A LOT of it in order for that to happen. I use more than 10 pumps at a time, which is too much considering how much this product cost. I want to pare it with the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel to see what happens, even though I am not a gel person at all (my hair is thin and gels usually weigh my hair down), but I am willing to give it a try. I have 3A-3B curly hair that is a couple of inches passed my armpit.
"
"
Excellent product. Thank you!
"
"
I had high expectations with this volumizing foam, however it didn't live up to any of the expectations. The product leaves my hair crunchy and without the promised volume. I definitely wouldn't recommend this product. By the way, I my curly hair type is a mix between 3a + 3b + 3c.
"
"
This is my favorite mousse ever!! It gives me volume on top and doesn't make my hair sticky. Great product
"
"
Spolier alert: I bought this for my wife. SHe adores it, the local CVS was out of it, and Amazon Prime had it at a lower price. Good deal all around.
"
"
Exactly what I wanted. Came quickly. Very happy with this product. It is wonderful for curly hair. I highly recommend it.
"
"
This like every other cheap mousse sold at drugstores -- except 5x the price! Hair is sticky (even with a very small amount applied) and always looks super dry. My blonde hair looks like curly hay. Awful.
"
"
Some people love this but it's not for my hair. I have thick hair that is very wavy and curly when wet but dries pouffy. I purchased this hoping I could air dry and have the result of natural, beachy waves. This made my hair curly and a bit crunchy a la Baby from Dirty Dancing style.
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Did not do anything.  Tried a little, tried a lot, tried on wet hair, tried on dry hair.  He does not like it spam I am, he does not like green eggs with ham.  Don't waste your money. Cannot return.
"
"
This makes my hair super knotty, feel dirty and doesn't really control frizz very well.  I love Deva Curl products, but this one isn't my fav.
"
"
I don't know why the volumizing foam appeared used and/or old. It was missing the top and even the label looked worn out. It was not enclosed in plastic like all of the other products in the box were. The bottle isn't even filled to the top; it appears that roughly 25% of it is missing. I am very unsatisfied because I recall ordering a NEW one, not a used one.
"
"
Great for hair that doesn't adjust well to product. If you 'scrunch out the crunch' it works perfectly to hold light curls.
"
"
Ok, let me just say this product has literally changed my life. It helped my fall in love with my curly hair. Say goodbye to frizz and hello to beautiful shiny curls. I have very fine hair and have tried lots and lots of products that were always too heavy.This product did not weigh my hair down... absolutely perfect!
"
"
Great product.  Doesn't leave residue on your hair.  Works great, even on rainy days
"
"
Makes your curly hair even more curly.  I looked like I had an afro after using it.  A little too much volume.
"
"
nasty stuff - will not order again
"
"
Crunchy in hair
"
"
That’s how I got the product. Is water down for sure.
"
"
My hair isn't as frizzy
"
"
Absolutely hated it! Made my hair more frizzy than usual.
"
"
Nice and light yet does the job.
"
"
For curly hair, nothing better
"
"
Wonderful foam for styling wavy hair!
"
"
In my opinion it's not worth it.  This product leaves my hair crunchy!  I haven't used mousse for years and I'm remembering why.  Don't let the name, ""volumizing foam"" fool you.  I bought this product because it sounded like it would tame my curls without the crunchy untouchable feel.  You may as well go to Target and buy a cheap mousse because that's what this product feels like.  I would not buy this product again and I highly doubt I will even use it again.  It may be related to my hair type but I imagine that this would be the case regardless of hair type.
"
"
Ive been using deva products for about 3.5 years now. This so far is my fave. I use One Condition daily as my CO wash and just to moisturize. I used to follow it up once i got out of the shower with the ArcAngel.. but then my stylist recommended this and I fell in love. It lasts much longer, you use less. This little bottle has lasted 3 and a half months so far and I probably have another week left in the bottle. I used 4 pumps a day and that it... i have right below the shoulder length, really curly thick hair. My hair dries quicker with than over the arc angel too.LOVE this stuff.Lightly Scrunch it in when hair is still pretty wet, and do no touch until your curls are completely dry. shake the curls and fluff it up. Perfect hair every time.
"
"
The ingredients in the bottle have changed. The new formulation does not work as well against humidity.I have stopped using it. The ingredients as listed on this page are the old formulation.
"
"
I have tried a lot of products on my curly hair, and this is one of my two favorites.Pros:- Great control.- Super light.- With a little water to refresh, easily lasts two days.- A little goes a long way.Cons:- It can get crunchy if you use too much. just don't use too much.- If I don't use the pump for a few days, it jams on me every time. this product is too expensive for it to be leaking out of the side of the bottle due to a jammed pump.
"
"
Product was not the same as the original one I bought in the store it kind a has a funny smell still works good but smells funny
"
"
This product is a necessity for curly hair!! It's super light weight, so it doesn't weight your hair down in any way. I've been using it for about 2 years now, and it's one of my favorite devacurl products. For anyone looking to add some volume to their hair without the frizz, this is perfect for them. It leaves your hair feeling much lighter and airy, and it smells amazing. I absolutely love it.
"
"
The best mousse I have ever used. It doesn't dry out my hair and lasts a long time. Some people complain about the stickiness and the flaking. Here are some tricks that I use: Wash your hair, squeeze water out of hair. Dispense 2-3 pumps of product (that's all you need) into hands. If you use more, you are wasting product and it will create sticky hair. Rub hands lightly together and scrunch through hair. Let hair air-dry without touching or use diffuser with hair dryer. After hair is dry, ""break"" the stiff curls by gathering your hair together and scrunching it once more. Your curls should be soft now. If you do not wash your hair every day, resist adding more foam when you style your hair the next time. This is overkill. Use a water bottle filled with water, spray your hair, scrunch and follow drying procedure, as stated above. This refreshes your curls.
"
"
After I was done with chemo my grew back curly Aja chemo curl tod production t helps reign in the frizzies
"
"
avoid this crap at all possible. doesn't matter if you get it on Amazon, Sephora or Ulta, even their website. Look up how DevaCurl is making thousands of women and men's' hair fall out.
"
"
I don't know too much about hair products and don't really use anything, but my stylist prompted me to try out this product (which I wasn't too unhappy to do as it's not incredibly expensive). I have pretty fine and thin-ish hair that is fairly straight with just slight waves at the ends. I'm really not big on hair product, but I've absolutely loved this foam! It's great at defining slight waves and giving thin hair a bit of lift--and it's lightweight enough to not feel as though it's sticking in your hair like many other hair products! Though it's marketed as a product for curly hair, I'd definitely say it does a fantastic job of defining thin, wavy hair, so if you do have a similar hair type, I'd encourage you to try it out! I've gotten tons of compliments on my hair ever since I started using it.
"
"
I decided to purchase this product, based on the positive reviews here, and on the naturallycurly.com website.  I wanted to get the maximum amount of curl out of my naturally curly hair, and the Ouidad products/cut, were just not achieving that.  My hair is about 3"" past my shoulders.  I applied 4 to 5 pumps of this foam on damp hair, and scrunched (in accordance with the Deva technique).  Once my hair dried, it looked like a bunch of crunchy ringlets.  I was a little concerned at that point, thinking that I may have used too much of the product.  No worries though.  Once I re-scrunched my curls, they lost that crunchy look.  I now have nice soft curls, that hold throughout the day and into the next.
"
"
This is fantastic for wavy hair. It's light enough not to weigh my hair down. I use about 3 to 4 pumps (my hair's thick & below the shoulders) after I work in some DevaCurl Wave Maker.
"
"
Bought it at ulta but felt like i needed to write a review on here. Doesnt work at all. Left my 3b hair a frizzy mess. And it smells like hair dye.
"
"
I quite like the product and have bought it numerous times.  I have a friend and a son who have used it.  We have all experienced bottles that quit functioning before the product runs out.  My most recent bottle quit pumping foam (just leaks the liquid product around the neck) with only 1/3 of the product used.  I will not be spending more money on this product until Deva can improve the bottle.
"
"
Tried it for a long time with the other DevaCurl products. Gave up on it. Made my hair slightly sticky and crunchy later in the day.
"
"
Fantastic product for thinner wavy hair.
"
"
Great
"
"
Just what I expected
"
"
Didn't like it
"
"
Was really looking forward to this, very disappointed.
"
"
This product does add volume.  With super curly hair, volume isn't really the problem, but I use it for volume just at the roots of the top and crown of my head.  It seems to help prevent ""flat head.""  Very little product is needed.  It has a pleasant smell.
"
"
This works so well!!!! I only use Devacurl products these days. It's what I needed in my early teenage years. Would've saved me from a lot of bullying. This new product is great if your hair is getting thinner or finer. It really does help avoid the 'triangle' head. Thank you Devacurl! You've done  it yet again!
"
"
This is a great product!  I use with BeLeave in after shampooing and conditioning.  Nice results.  I have swavy hair type (Natural curl when the right products are used, and slightly wavy when left alone.  I like a little more controll and some curl.  The Deva Curl products seem to deliver those results - after some trial and error on my part.  The website gives you a good recommendation on which products to get for  various  hair types; however, it still is necessary to consider your  particular  hair (thickness/thinness; fine/course; and how much encouragement it needs to  curl).

As with most Deva products, you'll want to watch the videos online/ read instructions prior to using, just so you get the best possible effect to start out with.  Once you get their method down, though, you can start customizing it to suit your own preferences.  I've found that the foam is sooo versatile.  I use it a few different ways, generally 5 pumps does the job (I have THICK, shoulder length waves with some curl):1.  The Standard.  Wash + condition (comb only in shower, only with conditioner in), squeeze out water, dry with an old tee, then , scrunch in 2 pumps for bottom half of hair, 2 for the top, 1 more all over for good measure.2. The Day 2 rinse.  (for post workout days where I'm not yet ready to wash fully) Rinse hair in cool water; gently massage scalp, wide tooth comb while soaking wet in shower; dry with tee; scrunch in the foam.3. The Timelapse (for when I have to check on dinner between getting out of the shower and putting in hair product.  Look, you know this happens.)  Wash or rinse; squeeze and blot with tee shirt; wrap hair in tee shirt so water doesn't drip everywhere while you check the oven, switch the laundry, set DVR, whatever; come back to bathroom and scrunch foam.  WILL WORK BEAUTIFULLY even though your hair is really a touch too dry by Deva standards.**Air dry or gentle, cool diffuse.  ALWAYS use clips at roots until nearly dry.  Scrunch and shake.I typically wash and set my hair at night, and then sleep on it! - The foam holds my curls and despite rolling around on my pillow, my hair still has volume and no frizz in the morning.Been using for about a year now - very happy.  Still use the gel too sometimes, but the foam is my preferred Deva product.
"
"
This is the best product I ever used for my natural curls. For best results, scrunch your hair dry with a microfiber cloth. I use 3 squirts for my shoulder length hair. Turn your head towards the floor, scrunch DevaCurl into your hair. If your curls are to crunchy once they are dry then do one of two things: Use less product or scrunch your curls when their dry. And remember, avoid touching your curls, they will separate and look frizzy.
"
"
very disappointed in this, does not add volume to my hair at all but makes it feel kind of sticky like hair spray or something
"
"
It's good because when I apply it on my hair I obtain really pretty gets curls immediately, but this effect lasts just few hours. Unfortunately, later on the day my hair looks dry and frizzy. It might be because my hair it's very fine needs a cream instead of foam.
"
"
FINALLY something lite in weight that controls frizz. I've been looking for this type of product for wavy hair that can't be weighed down.
"
"
Absolutely LOVE DecaCurl products!!! Since I ""converted"" I would not let anything else touch my hair!!! I have gotten many, many compliments on my bouncy luscious curls since I started using these products!Before I started using them, my hair was lifeless and my curls were... well.. not so bouncy! These leave my hair happy without weighing it down!If this review has helped you in any way, please click the YES button. Thank you.
"
"
I love this product, but I will fuss about the bottle.  This product gives me a little bit more volume, but needs to be used sparingly or my hair feels a bit weighed down.  About one ""squirt"" works really well for my medium length curly hair.  The bottle dispenser gets a little ""stuck"" sometimes and has to be rinsed, but it's not a huge issue.
"
"
My first disappointing experience with a Deva product.  This stuff is awful. It often comes out of the container as liquid rather than foam, and when it DOES come out as foam, it leaves my hair very sticky-feeling.  On the upside, I can now serve as human flypaper! I used it for a couple of weeks, and tossed the rest which is a bummer because this isn't cheap.
"
"
I have fine, wavy hair and this mousse is perfect. It's not too heavy, but it really helps define my curls nicely. If you put too much on, it will be sticky and heavier. I found that 3 pumps is perfect for my shoulder length hair. I love the smell too - it's a nice lemony/vanilla scent. I use Alterna's Caviar CC creme as a base and layer this mousse on top. The two together are a perfect combination.
"
"
I tried using this after a shower then defusing my hair and that was a big No No. It really dried my hair out and made it feel like hay. I tried a few weeks later to using a half pump of the product again on a day between washes to try and freshen up my curls and it worked GREAT! Didn't leave my hair dry and got rid of the flyaways.
"
"
I have fine curly hair and usually struggle to find a product that doesn't weigh my curls down or make them too crunchy. This foam has just the right amount of hold that my hair needs. After I towel dry my hair I use a little bit of leave in conditioner then I use about 4 pumps of the foam and let it air dry. I try really hard to not touch it until its dry because it's so much better that way. Once it's dry I can fluff it up and mess with it but it doesn't destroy the curls! I would recommend to all curly girls!!
"
"
Great product for super curly and frizzy hair. I use with Deva Curl Ualtar Defining Gel. Love it. Truly amazing results. After years of using Aveda and other expensive products I've finally found alcohol free products that I really love and recommend.
"
"
I am not sure if this product contains the same ingredients as the original ones they sell at the store. But it definitely does NOT leave my hair the same.
"
"
It makes your hair crunchy. I hate that. My fav for curls is AG Recoil with a tad of Moroccan oil. Curls come out perfect and not crunchy and you can =use it on dry hair as a touch up! I love both products! BUT GET REAL MOROCCAN OIL. Not the fake stuff! It's called MOROCCAN OIL. Band name!
"
"
I use a lot of DevaCurl products but I'm not sold on this product.  I don't see much volume from it or help with my frizz.
"
"
So far so good! I watched videos online on how to use this product. It defintley leaves me with soft, defined curls. I do top it off with a little gel to help out with weather related frizz
"
"
On the Curl scale I'm about 3A/3B and my hair is almost shoulder length. I need a lot of moisture, but I also want good hold and definition. I love this product when used in conjunction with the One Condition.When my hair is sopping wet in the shower I put in about a quarter-size dollop of One Condition and scrunch that through, then I use about 4-5 pumps of this foam and scrunch that in. Then I diffuse with my blow drier on a low heat (otherwise my hair would take HOURS to dry).Things I like about this foam:-Great hold, I can wear my curls for at least two days without frizz, often times three days!-Doesn't take too long to dry, doesn't add dry time by staying wet.-No crunchy curls, they always feel soft and springy.-Seems like the bottle will last me longer than the styling cream I used to use.The smell is alright, not my personal taste, but it fades fairly quickly, so I don't notice it during the day.Lightning fast shipping too! It arrived at my house even before I got the email saying the item was shipped!UPDATE: Well, its been FIVE months, and I'm still on the same bottle! Granted, I am reaching the end of it, but I'm surprised how long it has lasted. Like I said, My hair is about shoulder length, a little shorter, but this foam has really gone a long way. I haven't personally had any major issues with the pump, but I can see how the design could cause issues if dropped, or you get a fluke. Overall I'm still really satisfied with this product. I've used Miss Jessie's Quick Curls, the Deva Curl Styling Cream, the Arc AnGel, and other products too, but I find this one with the One Condition used as a leave in works wonders. I'll be sticking with this for the foreseeable future!
"
"
My new favorite Deva product!  I use just a little on the bottom third of my hair (shoulder length 3C medium density) and let it air dry.  It's lightweight and scrunches out to leave nice, shiny curls.  My hair's moisture and curls are prone to changing with the seasons, but this winter - along with a weekly deep conditioning with mayonnaise - co-washing and this foam are all I need.
"
"
This actually really helps define my curls.  I used to use the moisture lock spray, now I use this, or sometimes both, on top of the Angel curl enhancer.  I would definitely recommend this product. I am still struggling with shine, haven't found the right product for that yet, but if I use the NoPoo, the Conditioner, the Angel and this, I get really nicely defined curls.
"
"
This worked very well, doesn’t dry out the hair either.
"
"
Daughter uses for her wavy hair and it does a great job at cutting the frizz of split ends.
"
"
I mix this product with the devacurl ultra defining gel while it is dripping wet, then shake my hair to separate the curls, scrunch-dry my hair with a t shirt and then sit under a diffuser for about half an hour.  This REALLY helps my hair.  I finally have frizz free curls... Warning: Mixing this product with the gel does make your hair a little hard, but what is nice, is you can completely soften it up by pressing on it or scrunching it after your hair dries.  I never have to straighten my hair any more.  Oh and put your hair in a high bun when you go to sleep. When your hair starts to get a little frizzy or droopy the next day, you can reapply some water and restyle it.  (My stylist told me not to wash it every day or it will dry out).
"
"
Love this and works great
"
"
This stuff works great.  I wasn't sure what to expect because I've used form before and didn't like it.  I am, however, very satisfied.  It calms my thin curly frizzy flyaway hair without being stiff or heavy.  You can comb it if you want to relax it more without it getting frizzy again.  It also adds shine.  Glad I found this product.
"
"
Adds volume, lightweight, has a scent but I like it and it's not too strong.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
This is anything but making curls without frizz. My hair looks horrible, frizzy, and the curls are worse than my natural worse. Not worth a penny. I am moving back to John Frieda No frizz which is waaaay better .
"
"
Appears to help with the frizz of curly and wavy hair.
"
"
I have fine hair and was having difficulty iwth dispersing the DivaCurl Angel (gel) throughout my hair. My hair dresser suggested using this product because the gel comes out in a foam. I love this! I was told it can be refilled with this companies Angel (gel) product and water, once empty. I highly recommend this product!  My curls look so shiny and healthy!
"
"
DevaCurl is by for the best curly hair product that I have ever used and I have tried dozens. I have told tons of people about it and then they start using it too and love it. This product is great for shorter currently here as it doesn't way down the curls and gives it fuller body.
"
"
Very fast shipping and great product.
"
"
This product is great.  I used to use the AnGel, but my hair would get frizzy by the end of the day.  This product is much better, leaving my curls feeling natural and helping keep the shape.  I have used hundreds of products in the past, and this is by far my favorite.
"
"
Makes my hair look wet and feels waxy. But it does get rid of frizz.
"
"
Good for dry frizzy, curly hair
"
"
I LOVE DevaCurl products for my curly hair. The foam gives my hair a lot of volume and keeps it frizz free during the day. Be careful not to use too much near your scalp though! It can get funky.
"
"
Same awesome product you find in the salon but for less money.
"
"
Perfect for when you want the curls to look bouncier and last longer
"
"
This did nothing but tangle my hair, flatten my curls, and create more frizz.
"
"
I used devacurl cream and loved it. Just because the cream I thought was a little messy, decided to try the foam. Not a big fan. Makes my hair dry and does not do much to my frizz. I have naturally curly/wavy hair.
"
"
I'm very disappointed with this product. I tried this product for a period of about a month between July and August. On the most humid days, it did nothing to reduce my frizziness. If I increased the amount that I applied it left my hair greasy-looking and crispy.
"
"
Just switched to using the foam and gel. I like how much fuller it makes it for when I put it up. Easy to use and helps with the frizz
"
"
One of the few products that work on my hair.  Gives hair a nice curly look.
"
"
Wanted to find something like Ojan's (discontinued) hydrating volumizing foam.  This is definitely NOT it.  I used it once and it was so sticky I'll never use it again.  Same with their hair spray.  Ug.
"
"
This is probably my 3rd order of this product. It leaves my curly hair full and it lasts a whole week without needing to re wet it or anything. One of the best products I have purchased For my curls.
"
"
Gives my curls volume, but also makes them more defined. This makes them crunchy when it dries, but then I flip my head upside down and scrunch and they all loosen up and look perfect :)
"
"
It's tough to bash a product that so many people are having good results with but I've finally reached my limit with DevaCurl's Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam. The pros? It definitely adds some volume (but that's never been a problem for me) and I like the smell. On the flip side, this product does nothing to combat my ruthless frizz and, worst of all, it leaves my hair extremely tangled - to the point where I have to break quite a few strands just to free it up the following day. I should note that I have been using between 2 and 4 pumps. This might be why the product is causing my hair to end up in knots - and I suggest following the lead of those who are only using only ONE pump (dunno...?).I have had so-so results with DevaCurl shampoos and conditioners, however, their styling products just don't work well with my long, thick, curly/wavy, and highly frizzy hair. Seeing as others love DevaCurl, my suggestion is to first go to a local store that offers free samples and test before you buy. Best of luck!
"
"
This stuff is hands down one of my favorite styling products.  The gel from DevaCurl doesn't work as well for me.  Smells great and a little goes a long way. I highly recommend switch to DevaCurl products.
"
"
I'm not sure how much it volumizes.  I use it on just washed hair to fill out hair where it has gotten thin.
"
"
Great product much cheaper on Amazon than Ulta
"
"
Use 3 pumps in addition to Deva light gel. Smells like Skittles to me. :)
"
"
Great for styling my fine curly hair.
"
"
Devacurl Frizz-free volumizing foam, works great for my perm
"
"
I've been blessed with lots of curls. Corkscrew curls that get super frizzy in any humidity.  This product is amazing. NO FRIZZ all day.  Use it sparingly, though because it will make your hair crunchy otherwise.
"
"
Just got this item today with no cap on bottle!
"
"
Deva curl is the only thing to keep my curls from being frizzy
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Great at frizz control
"
"
Doesn't hold as well as I'd like, but still makes hair very crunchy.
"
"
The product was shipped perfectly.  The product itself is not for me - made my hair feel dirty.
"
"
My wife has used this for her curly blonde hair forever and it does the job.  She has trouble finding products that work with her curly cut but this is engineered perfectly for it.  Easy to use and comes in a space saving bottle.
"
"
Love this for natural wave beach curls takes all the frizz  leaves beautiful shine
"
"
This is exactly what I needed to complete my devalcurl routine. It helps tame the frizz. I thought I could just get away with using the gel, but with my fine and fluffy hair texture, it really started to get frizzy with the wind or laying down. This helps my perfect curls stay perfect longer. Careful not to over apply it, it can weigh hair down!The prices here are better than in store or at the salon, too!
"
"
This my favorite volumizing foam. I apply it to my hair while wet and diffuse. It's perfect! Gives me the girl I'm after. It does leave behind a bit of a crunch, but it's considerably less than using a gel or other like product.
"
"
My hair is naturally curly and long. This mousse holds curl without being crunchy.  Curls remain without frizzing out over the course of the day.
"
"
Like product, helps with curl definition. Hair has a dry feel and frizzes a little.
"
"
It's light weight and does the job.  If you have wavy to curly hair this is the stuff for you.  It's not too heavy and it's not too light.
"
"
It works great, has a nice smell and most importantly doesn't leave your hair feeling dry or dull looking.  Just be careful not to use too much, a little goes a long way or you'll end up with a sticky head of hair!
"
"
good stuff
"
"
Love it! Tames my frizz and enhances my curls without making them feel like I have a tin of product in my hair. I also use the whole Deva Curl line.
"
"
have only tried this volumizing foam once so far but it left my hair nice and frizz free for 2 days. I love the Deva no-poo shampoo and one condition curly hair conditioner so this is a nice addition.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and use this after washing my hair.  Then I just scrunch and let dry.  Love that it isn't sticky but helps shape and hold the curl.
"
"
I absolutely love this product! It's light, yet puts perfect volume into my hair & keeps the style fresh til the next washing. For me it's a ""have to have"" item!
"
"
I wear this product from my ends up to mid way, on top I Use the deva curl gel and I have like the combination.
"
"
I love the product BUT the bottle pump is defective. The pump feature broke after the 5th time i used it. :(
"
"
Works great but leaves my hair a bit crunchy feeling.
"
"
This foam didn't do anything for my hair.  I do not recommend it.  Waste of money
"
"
Took the frizz right out of my curly hair and brought the curls out. Will buy again. Lasts a long time.
"
"
Love this product, definitely helps with reducing frizz!
"
"
I will NEVER be without this product !!!  If you have curly hair, this is a must have product to keep your frizz down!!
"
"
I've used this mousse for a couple years and continue to love it.  It holds my fine hair without being stiff.
"
"
This is one of Deva Curl's gluten free hair products and it works wonderfully. It works much better than other curl/scrunch products on the market. My only concern (as with all conventional hair products) is that it contains more potentially harmful chemicals than I would like. I will be exploring organic options in the future. For someone who is not worried about chemicals, it is a top knotch product and I recommend it highly! You have to play around with the right amount to put in wet hair before you scrunch, but then you are good to go.
"
"
If you have curly hair this is a must have. Part of the trick is application so check out the website for how tos.
"
"
This is one of the best hair care items I have ever owned.  It give my hair volume, holds the curl, and leaves my hair soft all day long. I highly recommend it, especially if you have long curly hair.
"
"
I love this product and use it daily.
"
"
My favorite of the deva line. Gives great volume w a little wave and is very light in the hair.
"
"
Great Curly Hair Girl product in winter.  In Maryland I need stronger product in summer because it is so humid here!  I use it as well as the Deva Gel.
"
"
Easily my favorite DevaCurl product. Cannot live with out this foam!
"
"
Use very lightly. I have baby fine, curly hair, too much product makes the hair stiff and curls funny looking.  Use lightly. Smells great. It is the Real product.
"
"
I love the smell of the Deva Products .... they remind me of a refreshing springtime!!!! This mousse is my all time favorite, and does wonders for my curls!!!! Great investment for curly people!!!
"
"
Perfect! I love it! Just what I wanted! Arrived on time & exactly as described.
"
"
Best styling product I've used for adding body and definition to my very fine, curly hair. Adding a bit more on following days brings body right back.
"
"
Still like my other non-name brand products from Walmart (Tresemme). These tend to leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  Not for me. I have semi naturally curly hair and these products are too heavy and do not allow my hair to breathe.
"
"
This product does fight frizz but I find it leaves my hair rather sticky on second day hair.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and love Deva products.  My stylist recently recommended this new foam, and I wouldn't think I needed it given that my hair is already quite thick.  But I do find a little bit of it mixed with my gel helps to hold the curl even better than the gel alone.
"
"
Made me hair feel crunchier than other curl products. Prefer AG Hair Recoil Curl Activator which has a sticky creamier consistency.
"
"
It didn't work well for me.
"
"
I like it.  Foamy and light and smell is kinda citrusy.  I have curly wavy hair prob like a 2b and many products tend to weigh my hair down.  I've been experimenting with the amount of pumps 7 was way too much for my hair which goes to my mid back.  So a little goes a long way I'm now only using three pumps and it gives me softness hold and a tad bit of volume.  Love that it is sulfate free.  My favorite mousse is suave but discovered it had sulfate and so far I'm liking this mousse
"
"
Just the right amount of hold
"
"
Smooth transaction...no problems...thanks!
"
"
I use this with Deva Curl Set It Free Moisture Lock.  I prefer the foam on extra high humidity days here in Miami because I end up with long lasting frizz free curls.
"
"
I have fine curly hair that can get frizzy.This foam definitely works and also has given my hair great volume.  However, your hair will be very crunchy and you  have to wait a long while until it is totally dry to break up the curls (without risk of creating frizz) and fluff.Also, there are problems with the pump where it just stops working after a while. I purchased a travel pump that works better.I like Deva products a lot and regularly use Low Poo Shampoo,  B'leavin' Volumnizer and Deva's hairspray (which also works GREAT to keep eyebrows in place).
"
"
Left my hair feeling super stiff, the same feeling you would have after using a common mousse. Not what is advertised
"
"
Love it
"
"
I tried to stop using this but couldn't.  Goes on right after conditioner before gel.  Great product you need to try.
"
"
Recommended by my stylist to add fullness to my wavy, not terribly curly hair.  I can't see that it helps.
"
"
Love this stuff. I have used it for a long time and really gives body to my curly hair, I do clip it up while hair is air drying.
"
"
I love it. It holds my curls in place beautifully.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Love it!
"
"
I have naturally curly hair. I've been using this product along with Deva shampoo & conditioner for years! My hairdresser (on the East Coast) uses only the Deva line of products in her shop. I recently experimented by using a different shampoo but with the Deva conditioner & Volumizing Foam and it still works great!Now that I live Southern Oregon, I have to buy it online (paying $1 more but saving on shipping fees) as I have Amazon Prime, it was more cost effective to order from them.
"
"
They used it on me on my salon and I liked it.  I mix it with the gel.  I'm thankful that I can get a bit of a price break on Amazon for the Deva products.  I try to buy all of them there first.
"
"
Too heavy and Does Not defrizz
"
"
I use this and gel, and do much scrunching, and it looks great.
"
"
I used this product once & it does not work. Made my hair look & feel terribly dry. Smells horrible too & really over priced for such a horrible product. I had to wash my hair almost immediately after my hair dried & the product set in. My hair was a ball of frizz. I will NEVER again betray Shea Moisture products, lol (they are truly the best in my hair). I decided to try this stuff as I was traveling to Florida & I read this was suppose to be good for high humidity & it is the worse product I've ever tried! Never again! Save your money! This stuff is so expensive & does not work on high porosity 3B/3C curly hair like mine. I'd give it 0 stars if I could!
"
"
I like it but it is a bit too sticky. It leaves my hands REALLY sticky and my hair gets much harder than expected. On the plus side, I no longer use hair spray!
"
"
Was too drying for my wavy thin hair.  Might work better on another textured hair. I gave it away to a super curly haired friend.
"
"
I guess my hair is just a fuzzy mess since nothing really seems to work.  However, this is much better compared to any of the gel products by Deva.  It doesn't leave the gel/wet look all day!
"
"
I loved it! Makes my hair feel wonderful! Saves me loads of time. Looks great and makes me feels wonderful!
"
"
Expensive but if you like mouse over gel this is great!
"
"
I use it after using the coconut cream to lock in the curls.
"
"
I love this product! It is my favorite in the Deva Curl line. It gives my naturally thin hair so much volume. It looks fantastic!
"
"
I've been using this for the past six months or so and I really love it (AND still have half the bottle left!). I usually use about 4 pumps of this after a medium amount of DevaCurl Utra Defining Gel on super wet hair and then scrunch out the extra moisture with a microfiber towel, let it air dry, and scrunch out the gel crunch. Both products together gives me really good results. This stuff alone is too sticky, and the gel alone doesn't give any volume. I have shoulder-length very soft fluffy curls which tend to droop into waves throughout the day and are easily squashed when I sleep. The addition of the Volumizing Foam helps my curls not to droop so much throughout the day, and also makes it a lot easier to get nice curls in ""day 2"" if I just spray them with water and re-scrunch. Highly recommended for the people who have curls and want MORE volume - not the stereotypical curly girl problem, which makes it hard to find products for us, but this one is a keeper.
"
"
I have botticelli curls that are thick, but very fine which makes it difficult to find a gel/mousse that doesn't weigh down my hair. It was a bit tricky to learn how to use this product, but I really like it now and have had a number a people comment that my hair is much prettier and more healthy. Tip: when you use this product, make sure to keep it away from the scalp.
"
"
Great volume for fine hair.
"
"
I don't use anything but Deva Curl.  I love these products!
"
"
LOVE the Deva line of products!!
"
"
quality product
"
"
This product really ""pumps up the volume""!  I really love it and would recommend it.
"
"
I put this product in my hair after a shower and let it air dry.  It leaves mg hair with volume and curls!  Best of all, I save time getting ready.
"
"
really tames my hair; just love it!!!!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Been using it for several years. I like it.
"
"
Love the DevaCurl products!
"
"
LOve this stuff!!!  My hair always looks great and really brings out the curl.  Can not live without it :)
"
"
Love my foam! Volume and bouncy curls for me!
"
"
Deva Curl products are my weakness, I use this combined with the light gel and a curl styling cream. My curls always come out beautifully and I highly recommend for anyone with curls. This product also lasts awhile, which makes it a good buy even if it may seem pricey!
"
"
I use this in combination with a curly hair routine that looks something like this:  I wash with a sulfate free shampoo like No-Poo or Jessicurl Gentle Lather, condition/detangle/comb thru with Biolage Conditioning Balm (I usu buy the generic version here http://www.amazon.com/GVP-Conditioning-Balm-Compare-Biolage/dp/B004FK5XTY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389974148&sr=8-1&keywords=generic+value+product+conditioning+balm ) and then I remove excess water by gentle squeezing out with my hand and then wrapping it in a microfiber towel.  Then I apply some Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner (I am not mixed racially, but rather I am a blonde haired, blue eyed caucasian gal- but still love this stuff!) and flip my hair upside down and comb my fingers through it, making sure I condition all the way to the ends.  Then I apply curl keeper, comb through (still flipped upside down) then scrunch.  Then I apply this product (in a large quantity - several pumps - fine hair needs LOTS of product - way more than course hair!) then I scrunch some more.  I ""plop"" my hair then (check youtube if you don't know what this is), into a long sleeve tshirt and let it sit while I get dressed, apply makeup, chase my toddlers around to get them dressed, make their breakfast, etc.  Right before I am ready to head out for the day, I diffuse it for about 10 minutes and then let it air dry the rest of the way.  Even using a TON of product, my hair is not crunchy.  I have soft, touchable, springy coils.  I have always used mousse and preferred it over very heavy gels which can really weigh fine hair down and not allow the bounce/volume you want, but this one is much better for my hair than others I have used (although I really like the pantene curl line mousse too). I get compliments all the time and also a lot of requests from people asking what I do to get my hair to look so good/behave so well.  I always tell them it is the products and routine because before I figured it all out my hair was an untamed beast!!!
"

Great product! I have very thick, coarse, curly hair and have used many styling products. This is light weight, yet has good hold. And so far, I'm frizz-free! I use it a little differently than what the directions suggest, and it's working quite well. I use it in the shower on soaking wet hair - after applying leave-in conditioner and SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. My hair is close to the center of my back. I rake 4 pumps of the DevaCurl Volumizing Foam through my hair (mostly mid-shaft to ends). I flip my head over and rake 3 more pumps through the top/front of my hair. While my head is still flipped over, I scrunch my curls upward - toward my scalp. I hope this makes sense. I imagine it does, if you're a curly girl! I'm still waiting to receive the DevaCurl Coconut Curl Styler. I plan to use that in place of the SheaMoisture.

It works like any other de frizzer.
"
"
Too stiff for curly hair and kinda oily looking
"
"
Hate the smell and it makes your hair very stiff.
"
"
Love great product
"
"
This is the best.  I have wavy fine hair.  It doesn't weight it down and gives it volume.
"
"
Great product for curly hair. Cheaper here at Amazon than any place else. Keep curly hair neat and keeps down the frizz.
"
"
I now use this everyday to scrunch my hair. I love the product but I do feel that by the end of the day my hair is too greasy.
"
"
i love this foam! it gives such great volume to my hair. I love scrunching two squirts in after my DevaCurl ArcAngel and B'Leave in.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and Deva products are the only ones I use.  The volumizing foam keeps my hair from frizzing even in rainy or humid weather.
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Great for day 2 hair when you need to tame your curls or sharpen their look.
"
"
good value
"
"
I'm baffled by the ""it's not sticky"" reviews.  I have used this off and on with varying results for a while.  I use B'Leave-in and light gel regularly, along with Set It Free on day 2-3.  Was hoping for some soft, cohesive volume with this.  SOMETIMES it works, but it gets sticky and builds up very quickly, which is odd for a product that is supposed to volumize fine hair, right??  Anyway, ONE pump, mixed with water in my palm, seems to do it for me.  It smells great and I'm going to keep trying different way of application because it seems like such a beloved product. :)
"
"
The only product that gives me long lasting volume
"
"
I could not wear my hair curly and go out in public if it were not for this product. After I wash and condition my hair, while still in the shower with dripping wet hair, I apply this to my hair in sections (two side sections and a back section), scrunch, and then put my hair in a tshirt or microfiber towel to dry a bit. After 15 minutes or so, I dry my hair with a diffuser and presto - frizz free, smooth, curly hair with volume.
"
"
I just can't live without this stuff!  It manages to tame my curly/frizzy hair very well along with the DivaCurl Gel.
"
"
I have 2A or 3B curls (I still haven't figured out which!). This product always feels sticky to me and makes my hair crunchy regardless of how little or how much I use. It seems better if I diffuse, but I prefer air drying my hair. I've been to a DevaCurl certified stylist for years and it still doesn't work for me.
"
"
Yes, yes, yes.  Another winner from DevaCurl.  It looks like a liquid but when you shake it, it becomes a foam.  Easy to apply and definitely makes my curly hair behave better (although we all know that curly hair has a mind of its own!)  This is part of my regular routine:  No-Poo, Conditioner, B'Leave In, Set it Free and this Volumizing Foam.  Then you arrange it, diffuse it, shake it out and go...
"
"
I am really disappointed.  Thi makes my hair stiff and sticky unless i use it as the only product right after washing.
"
"
I love the product. However, it was supposed to arrive on a Tuesday and did not arrive until Thursday.
"
"
I have fine hair and this weighed it down and made it feel so gross/dirty! I even tried using less and it still was awful. I'm not even sure if it's the real stuff or if it was just old? But I don't want to buy another bottle of it to find out. I love all the other products! I am a huge fan of deva curl all the way!
"

I think this mousse is great if you are going the no/low poo route, as it doesn't seem to build up on my hair, and it seems to wash out completely.  I was using a silicone based mousse for awhile, and it was really starting to build up on my hair.  It wasn't until I used a clarifying shampoo that I realized how much product was in my hair. My hair was looking about two shades darker for a week or so, and I thought it was due to something in the Devacurl nopoo (it has oils) but it was actually the tre semme heat mousse that I had been using for the past weeks.  It all came out when I used the Devacurl lowpoo, and my hair went back to it's normal color.I actually like the way that silicones make my hair look, but I know they are damaging and hard to wash out, so the Devacurl mousse is a great alternative.  It doesn't work the same way, because it can't, but it does a great job, and it appears to completely wash out with the Devacurl nopoo.If you aren't using sulfate shampoos, it is challenging to find a product that will work, and will also not build up, because most silicones are not water soluble, and they require a detergent to get them out of your hair.  The Devacurl foam washes out with my nopoo, and a little goes a long way.  I was not excited about spending $20 for mousse, when the cheaper silicone products cost about 1/4 as much.  A little of this product goes a long way, and I only need to use one pump every other day, as I have a short bob right now.  I rub the product between my hands and then apply from tips to roots, then scrunch.  It's very easy to use and it smells great.  It keeps my curls together while drying and it helps avoid the dreaded frizz.I'm a big fan of all of the Devacurl line, and hope that they help me to FINALLY grow my hair long :)
"
"
need to get the whole line ladies!! i have been using it for about a year now (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam, Mister right, and soommmmee times  the set above! It is A MUST TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED! Lucky me my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free, you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!
"
"
I have used this product for years, but took about a year off from it.  I decided that it was still the best, but in using the most recent one I ordered (which has new labeling), it is pretty awful.  They must have changed the formula.  Before, it dried your hair a little hard, but when you broke the ""gel cast"", you had defined, pretty curls with good volume.  With this newest bottle, it just makes my hair dry and limp, with sad curls.  I tried to return it (which I am notoriously lazy about doing) but this is not eligible for returns, which makes sense.  I won't be buying this product again.  I'm sad, it used to be so good!
"
"
I wish I could use this as a volume boosting dry shampoo type of product on no-wash days, but it only really works on wet or damp hair. I spray my hair with a little water spritzer, but I find that my hair has to be pretty damp for this to work.. one of my favorite things about not washing daily is not having wet hair or heat styling as often. Otherwise.. I love this stuff :)
"
"
This is a great product for my curly hair - honestly, most of the Deva products I've tried are good but this is the one I live by....however, it is on the pricey side so I definitely like to take advantage of it whenever the price falls below $20!!
"
"
This is the ONLY product that I will use to give my hair some body - not too heavy; not to light.
"
"
Very nice product, work well on my curls
"
"
I have super thin, super curly hair, and this product offers the volume I need without threatening my fabulous curl. My salon uses these products and I was really happy to find them at a reduced rate online. If you have natural curls, I could not recommend the Deva Curl system enough. It is PERFECTION.
"
"
Not the best thing ever. Very expensive! If you use too much your hair is gunky and feels awful. The keys is to use a very tiny amount. Not sure if I will repurchase when this bottle is gone... I don't think it's worth the price
"
"
I was a little hesitant to use this product because I know that foams/mousses don't always work for everyone. But for my hair type, it's absolutely perfect. My hair is just above my shoulders and very fine, so I only use 1 1/2 pumps on soaking wet hair. After it dries and I've scrunched it out I'm left with voluminous and defined curls that are full of life! I will occasionally still have a bit of frizz left on my crown but I just touch that up with some DevaCurl Set It Free and I am set. I love that I can get third day hair with this; that's something I've never been able to achieve!
"
"
This is a fabulous, lightweight foam for curly/wavy hair. Have occassionally strayed trying to find something better, and have not found it. I've purchased this product probably 25 times. It's amazing. The smell is not my favorite, but after application, the smell is completely gone, so no worries.
"
"
The pump on this is horrible, I get liquid instead of foam.  Not sure if I just received a ""lemon"" because when I buy this at a salon the pump works great and the product is great.
"
"
The perfect foam for my short, curly hair. It doesn't leave my hair sticky like so many mousses and foams do. Easy to reactivate with water the next day. Pleasant light smell. Absolutely worth the cost, I don't think I'll use anything else from here on.
"
"
Was not very impressed with this product. It left my hair crunchy and hard.
"
"
I have fine curly hair, that with ArcAngel Gel and B’leave looked full and healthy, with well defined curls. I’ve been using this foam for a week now and it seems as my curls get worse and worse with each use. My hair looks like a hay that’s been through unsuccessful curl ironing, it feels greasy (and I only put 2 pumps, 1 pump doesn’t eliminate freeze) and I wonder if it’s water soluble as the product states it is. I don't think this product is designed for fine hair, maybe for coarser one.
"
"
I buy these products all the time and this time I got  this product without a top. It appears to used!! Not happy.
"
"
There was a lot of hype around this product from friends and my salon, but I found it insubstantial.  It had the same effect on my hair as tap water...
"
"
This did not work for my hair. It made my hair greasy and the next day my hair had crazy static.
"
"
moose is not my thing, micht work better for someone with wavy and less curly thick  hair.
"
"
love this product; only wish they made a travel size
"
"
I usually love Deva products and have been using them for years (No poo, angel, and mister right are my favorites) but this one was a big disappointment.  It doesn't really come out foamy at first.  It comes out runny...even when you shake it a lot and then eventually starts to foam.  Waste of product.  But the real problem is that it made my hair feel sticky and then it went straight.  The next day my hair felt thin and dry (and straight).  I've tried it about 10 times now and have had the same result each time.  Wish I could return it but I've had it too long now.
"
"
This seems to be the best product for my curls, thus far.  I'll keep buying & using it.  I recommend all the DevaCurl Products.
"
"
This stuff is seriously great. I did a lot of research before buying it, and was on the fence about whether I should use this or the styling cream. I have thin, fine, dry type 3A/3B curls that can't really handle too much product, so I went with the foam even though some reviews said it was sticky or crunchy. I have not found that to be the case at all. I use a few pumps, scrunch and release, and blow-dry about 3/4 of the way dry with a diffuser. My hair has way more volume than it used to and the curls are well defined. I will definitely buy again.I could see how people would complain of crunchiness if they don't scrunch and move their hair around while it's drying. Like most other mousses, you have to kind of play with the curls a little so it doesn't set like a cast.
"
"
Did ALL my Christmas shopping on Amazon with all but 1, mishap....the DevaCurl Foam.  It arrived with 3 or 4 other products (all in their own boxes/packages) in a big box, loosely floating around the bottom with  the cap missing.  Naturally it leaked all over the bottom of the box & onto one of the other packages.  Luckily I was able to save the merchandise that it saturated (being a plastic item in it's own box).  A good portion of the foam had been dispensed though.  I called Amazon and they sent a return label (very accomodating as usual), but for a mere $18.00, I decided to just take the hit and keep it myself.  I'm not sure if it's an oversight on the merchant, or whom ever packaged the product to be delivered - possibly a combo of both!!
"
"
Adds volume to my the roots of my fine 3BC curls. Used after One Condition and it fluffed up my curls. Maintained my curls for a week, until the next wash. Nice scent. Easy to use.
"
"
Good product
"
"
I have weird, thick, out of control, curly hair  - it's straighter in the front with horribly frizzy, tight ringlets in the back and random patches of near-straight hair in the back bottom layer that stick out like the spokes of a wheel if not cut properly. If there's even the slightest hint of humidity that day everything puffs out like an angry cloud and I walk around looking something like a cross between a lion and a poodle with a bad perm. I'm not a girl who messes around too much with beauty products, but even I am appalled by how bad my hair can get and finally I decided to get my hair taken care of. After going through several other products and when I was nearly ready to give up, I went down to a salon specializing in curly hair and was recommended this product.It's nice to finally find something that keeps my hair in line without too much fuss. All I do is leave my conditioner in and apply about 2 pumps of this stuff, scrunching the front and raking through the back with my fingers. It lasts for a while, so if I'm in a real hurry in the morning and don't have time for a shower I still look passable, if not great. If its really humid my hair still frizzes out part way through the day but for the most part this does the trick.

I was really excited to try this new Deva product, which just came out about two weeks ago, and love it so far.  Although it looks like a liquid in the bottle, it pumps out like one of those hand soaps where the liquid turns into a foam. This product is meant to be Deva's version of a mousse, and it gives great volume and definition.I don't use Deva's shampoos and conditioners -- just their styling products -- and find that the FFVF plays well with the Curl Junkie products that I use to cleanse and condition.  I've been using it over the Deva B'Leave In, and it works great to further define my waves.  Since it provides a nice amount of hold, I've found that I don't need to use a gel over it.My hair is a few inches past my shoulders, and I've found that about 2 1/2 pumps is enough to thoroughly coat my hair.  After raking in about four pumps of B'Leave In to my wet hair, I then rake in about 2 1/2 pumps of the FFVF, then use a spray bottle to re-wet my hair and get the clumps to re-form.  Then I scrunch my hair to re-activate the curl.  I do all this bending upside down in the shower.)Before purchasing this, I had been worried that it would be too heavy for my fine waves, but it's not at all; it feels nice and light, and there's no need to ""scrunch out the crunch"" when you use it.  It also gives me great second-day hair, and I haven't had to re-apply it the next day.As with all Deva products, it's also silicone-, paraben-, and sulfate-free, so it works well with the Curly Girl method, which is explained in Lorraine Massey's (the founder of Deva) book Curly Girl: The Handbook.While this is an expensive product, I'm glad I picked it up!
"
"
Love love love! I mix this with the ultra gel and scrunch it into my hair when it’s still soaking wet from the shower. After my hair air dries, I scrunch again and my hair is SO SOFT but the curls hold for 2-3 days with just a mist of water. I have very fine, longer 2c/3a/3b hair.
"
"
The dispenser will not release the foam. Liquid squirts out everywhere, but no foam. I've tried shaking it and several other techniques to get the foam.. I've also contacted DevaCurl, but they have no interest in exchanging it for one that does work. Greatly disappointed given the cost of this product. Would have expected at least decent customer service from them.
"
"
I am continuously looking for a product that I can rely on to tame my frizzy hair, especially since I don't wash it every day. This product has worked great so far, if I need a little touch up, I just spray a little water in my hair and I'm good to go.
"
"
I think this product is great from a curl and volume standpoint.  My stylist turned me on to this after I had just been using the Arc AnGEL.  Completely non-sticky and creates beautiful bouncy curls for me! I don't know that I would call it frizz free for me, but I think that is more about my curls, not the product.  My only gripe is that the seal seems to leak between the base of the lid and the pump.  I have contacted the company and they are sending me a new bottle.  Very quick response from them.
"
"
WHY have I waited until now to try this fabulous foam?? If you're looking for slightly more hold than the gel alone can provide, plus some frizz-fighting action, buy this! I have wavy hair, and the gel itself wasn't providing the best hold. I applied this after doing the no-poo, then one-condition, scrunched in a little gel, towel scrunched, then scrunched in a couple pumps of this- and I'm so amazed with the results :) the smell is fabulous, I couldn't be happier :) and the next day hair doesn't need more than a couple scrunches!
"
"
I wasn't impressed with this foam. It wasn't so much foam as it was ""suds."" It had a weak sudsy consistency and no lather at all. So it was hard to spread it throughout my hair. Wherever the foam landed was where it stayed, so I'd have to pump out more to cover all of my hair. It also smelled like furniture polish, not something I like in my hair.Most importantly, this product doesn't reduce frizz. If anything, it creates more frizz. I usually end up layering some store bought mousse on top to tame the frizz. I do like some DevaCurl products, but I definitely wouldn't buy this again.
"
"
Works beautifully. I have never had an issue with deva curl products. The work perfect every time
"
"
I love this product.  I use this with Deva Styling Cream and I LOVE it.  I don't get crunchy hair but I also don't get frizzy hair.  Great product.
"
"
Defines my curls and adds some volume. I would love it if it added even a bit more volume, as my hair tends to fall flatter in the back, but this helps.
"
"
Terrible smell.  I have all the other products from diva curl and they smell great.  I'm not so sure this is the real product.
"
"
it works ok when I first bought it..but now it makes my hair feel sticky. I have to keep playing with my hair while it dries, otherwise it gets quite hard once your hair is completely dry.
"
"
I was really excited about using this product since I discovered that most curl salons use this in their “bounceback” treatments. I don’t use heat or pull my hair back but I have an autoimmune issue that causes my hair to fall out and this wildly disrupts my curl pattern so I was hoping that this would help that. While it did hydrate and yield bouncy curls, I am concerned about two things: 1) It has a HORRIBLE, overly perfumated smell that is incredibly overpowering. It smells like none of the other DevaCurl items and even after I applied my styling products it continued to overpower them. 2) The product is white. I was expecting it to be a green color because it’s made with seaweed. It leads me to believe that the seaweed was bleached or they chemically removed the color. After speaking with marine biologists, this process actually removes any efficacy of the seaweed. So it makes me wonder: WHY would they bleach it out, and WHAT actually is providing the “deep sea repair.” It makes me wonder if the strong overly perfumated scent is hiding the strong bleach odor from bleaching out the green seaweed color, and thus that is why it’s so strong. Because the item was$54, I’ll use the rest of the bottle but I don’t think I’ll purchase again...
"
"
I was sceptical. I have colored curly hair (type 2c/3a), with some serious damage at the ends. No matter what I tried, I just couldn't get my hair ends to be hydrated, and it was always frizzy and tangled. I tried oil treatments at home, other deep conditioning treatments and nothing worked.I tried this treatment once, and kept it on just a little longer than I'm supposed to (about 1 hour), and my dry ends are FINALLY feeling hydrated! It's not completely healthy yet, but the change I saw after just one use has got me so excited! My hair isn't as tangled as it used to get too (which means less breakage!). Very very happy!
"
"
I wish I would have known about diva curl when I was younger. This mask (in combination with several other products of same brand) gave me incredibly defined curls. Thank you so much. I let it sit on my hair about 15 mins. FYI, I also used Set it Free on wet hair. Then i combined B'leave-in and Supercream, then scrunched it in. After that I blew dry with a diffuser I always use. Curly girls, you need a blowdryer with a cool shot. The cool air helps to close the cuticle. Now, I won't wash my hair for 3-4 days.
"
"
Warning... not CG approved. I refuse to waste it but will not buy again.
"
"
I have 2b-2c wavy hair that's color treated & after a visit to a salon damaged my curl pattern aggressively, I started researching the whole protein thing to help bring my hair back to life.  I used a clarifying shampoo first, then put this on my head & left it for a few hours in a shower cap. After rinsing out, even the first time, I could see the improvement. I'm slowing getting my locks back to life & following the Curly Girl method pretty religiously. Maybe one day I'll aspire to be a CG IG model, but today is not that day.  Either way, I'm very happy with the progession that my hair has made while using this product & I'll continue to use it. For context, I use quite a few of the DevaCurl products & have been overall very happy with them.
"
"
I've used this twice since it arrived and am already seeing a change in my curls! I normally go through at least 2 bottles of conditioner per bottle of shampoo I use, so if you're like me and feel like there is never enough conditioner in the world, I highly recommend! I'm making my way towards the Curly Girl Method, and finding this a helpful product to enhance my curls.
"
"
Nothing special whatsoever.....Shea moisture protein masks are a lot more conditioning and strengthening than this i recommend those n they are way cheaper (coupons available etc) compared to this. Those I can use alone and get moisturizing benefits as well but this isn't hydrating enough for my curls n I have to mix it with others so yeah not worth it at all
"
"
I use this whenever I feel like my hair is getting too dry or sad-- I slather my hair with it, put my hair in a shower cap, and sit in the tub for 45 min before I wash it out in a normal shower.  It leaves my hair feeling stronger and happier, though sometimes it's a bit difficult to figure out if I've managed to wash it all out because it does make my hair feel more slippery, if that makes sense.  Works great for my curls and would highly recommend.
"
"
Brought the curl back to my hair that was beginning to show signs of heat damage from flat ironing.  It’s very thick and penetrates the hair when used with a heating cap.  Great price compared to $35 in retail stores.
"
"
This is one of my favorite deep conditioners. I follow it up with the deva curl styling cream.  I put on a plastic shower cap and then use my hot heads thermal heat cap for 30 minutes.  My hair feels stronger and extremely moisturized after I use this deep conditioner.  My other favorite is Curlsmith's Double Cream Deep Quencher.  Deep condition once a week everyone!

I can not believe how soft my permed/colored hair is after using this just 2 times! I just keep touching my hair hair because I can not believe it. My 12 year old daughter actually said it feels like her hair now. When before it was very dry and brittle.
"
"
It smells like artificial banana. The real one has more of a cologne fragrance.
"
"
Instantly stopped breakage and more manageable.  You can see the difference from the 1st treatment
"
"
While this is pricey for me, not for most I'm sure, it is so worth it! I cannot believe the depth of moisture in my hair & my hair is not only noticeably softer but also stronger! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product & will definitely buy more in the future as I can afford it.
"
"
Leaves quite a waxy residue but definitely tightens/defines my curls somehow.
"
"
I have 3B curls and bought this as they love a little extra moisture. This mask was good, but I think it may be too much protein to be my go-to deep conditioner.
"

After using Deva Deep Sea Repair got tons of compliments on my curls !!

This conditioner gives my hair ""slip"" even if I just shampooed and my hair wasn't liking me when I washed out the shampoo... as soon as I put this on and leave it there for a few minutes, my hair definitely thanks me. I will be repurchasing again and again!
"
"
My hair usually doesn't like protein treatment because it can make my hair stiff and tangled, but this formula agrees with my hair.  I mix it with a deep conditioner for even better results.
"
"
I have many products from Deva..but this was underwhelming..I have AA hair 3c/4a and it did nothing remarkable..I've used it many times and still nothing about the texture has changed and it was still difficult to comb even if this was drenched in my hair. I won't purchase again.
"
"
I only used it once l, but so far it's not working great with my hair. It looks more frizzy with lots of flyaways. This is the only the second deva curl product I've tried and both seemed drying on my hair. I probably won't purchase anymore
"
"
Sometimes, buying hair products from amazon sellers can be risky due to fake products. I compared this bottle to the one I bought for $36 from Ulta and it is the same product. It is not fake. Works great for dry curly hair. It is my favorite deva curl hair mask. Will definitely purchase again from this seller!
"
"
Too sticky/clay like feeling. I dont like this product at all. Applying it on my hair is a little rough, and its only OKAY for applying right after you've washed your hair, and want to style it for a day- Naomi
"
"
Todos los productos de la.marca son excelentes
"
"
I have a combination of 4a -4c hair. I Put it on and sat under a hooded dryer for 30 minutes and my hair drank it up! It was so much easier to detangle. My twist outs feel like butter. Soft and fluffy. I’m in love! Wish it came in a bigger tube though cuz I’ve only used it twice and it’s half way through and it’s not cheap. I’m only giving it 4 stars because of the price.
"
"
This product was recommended to me and has made my hair more manageable and soft. You cant beat the price here. in addition the packaging was perfect.
"
"
Good product but i don't feel any big difference
"
"
DevaCurl products work really well with my curly hair.  I use the Deep Sea Repair about once a week.
"
"
It didn’t moisturize the way I was hoping! But what doesn’t work for my hair may work for yours.
"
"
It has a nice smell and seems to be working well. I have noticed my hair doesn't seem to break as often and the curls look so healthy and moisturized after use. My curly girl hairstylist recommended this to me.
"
"
This was just meh for me.  No improvement but it made my hair soft while in the shower.  That’s about it.
"
"
Great protein mask!!! follow the instructions or it could give you serious protein overload.
"
"
I have been using this for 3 weeks now and for sure see a noticeable difference!
"
"
I have 3A, low porosity hair and I am not sensitive to protein. That being said, this product seems to weigh my hair down, especially on day one after using it, but has desirable effects after that. I do think that you could find a protein mask that is just as good as this one for a better price though.
"
"
My hair looks great when I use this on wash day!
"
"
I bought it for repairing my bleach damaged curls- they wouldn’t curl like they used to and moisture wasn’t an issue- protein was- after using this once for 30 minutes, I already see a dramatic improvement in my hair and curls 😍 can’t wait to see what it will be after a few uses!
"
"
I’ve never been big on masks, but I love the way my hair feels after using this.
"
"
brought back shape and definition to my hair
"
"
Love this product, made. Huge difference!
"
"
Made my scalp itchy
"
"
Although they are awesome products I purchased an entire package I’m loyal and only using this products only  but my hair is not loving it yet I’m going to give it three months in total to see if it gets better  I’m only on the second month
"
"
Great to add protein and moisture
"
"
Love it
"
"
I have mildly curly hair and live by DEVA products.
"
"
This product requires small amounts and it delivers big. My curls look defined structured and healthy every time I use this. ( once a week)
"
"
Ok
"
"
This product really brought my hair back to life after being in a pool and after dying my hair!! My curls looked better than they ever have been!
"
"
The mask does not have a pleasant smell and does not hydrate the hair at all. My hair looks fizzy after that. Would not buy again !
"
"
Not a bad product, maybe it just isn’t for my hair type. It leaves my hair hard.
"
"
I love itIt’s the best hair treatment I’ve ever had
"
"
I did not care for this. Left a film on my hair and made it feel very weighed down.
"
"
I'm glad to add this to my hair care routine!
"
"
Works nice
"
"
Is very good
"
"
Anyone that uses make up or hair products knows that product seals are an absolute MUST to ensure product integrity. I'm not sure if I will try it, but it does smell nice and not chemically altered. Sooo I don't know.
"
"
good
"
"
I thought this product was going to be more moisturizing. It is a good mask to use every other week but not the best one if you have dry hair.
"
"
This works pretty well my down fall is that it smells like hairspray
"
"
fabulous
"
"
Good
"
"
This product is awesome. Definitely not like other hair masks and does a great job conditioning my hair. I recently got it colored and my hair got super dry but this product made my hair manageable.
"
"
This stuff is amazing! So moisturizing. Made my curls look Fabulous!
"
"
It actually put a hole in my hair size of a quarter
"
"
So far used it once and it left hair feeling SUPER SOFT !!
"
"
It didn't work on my hair at all it just made it dryer
"
"
makes my daughter hair very soft
"
"
Made my hair so soft!
"
"
My hair feels amazing!
"
"
Mixed with Melt into Moisture and my high porous, curls look and feel so much better! Smells delish!
"
"
Sells fake Deva Curl. BEWARE, Deep Sea repair mask, fake. I have a real to compare. Smells of alcohol.
"
"
I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! My hair feels amazing! ❤️
"
"
The product is great! But i received it with a hole in the bottle and half the product was in the package
"
"
Great!
"
"
It lasted me one time, I have 3c/4a hair and these procucts didn’t work well at all, no slip and the smell was atrocious.
"
"
I love it
"
"
Great product.  Happy with the results.
"
"
Very moisturising
"
"
My wife loves this product.
"
"
I have several DevaCurl products that I love, but this one is awful for my hair. I've used it three times and I get the same results. It leaves my hair very dry and frizzy. It also makes my curls limp and droopy. Many people seem to love it, but it's the worst conditioner I've ever used. I'm very disappointed in this product.
"
"
It is just perfect!
"
"
Really like this condition and found a great price on Amazon.  At least $10 less than other places.  I've been wanting to add a sea protein type product to arsenal.  Its a great deep conditioner supplying just the right amounts of protein and moisture to my naturally curly hair.  My hair is dry but not processed or colored (I use henna to color).  I do a deep treatment twice a month and use to use Ouidad 12 minute reconstructor but its very expensive.  I would say this is comparable to that but much much cheaper. Smells okay nothing fancy but it definitely has an odor and I smell it after I've washed it out but not real strong and not at all once dry.
"
"
Love how my hair looks and feels after using this!  Much cheaper on here than other retailers!
"
"
Not sure if I've used it enough to notice a difference in my hair, but DevaCurl has the best products so I'll continue to use until it runs out.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Love this paired with melt moisture mask!! So worth your money:)
"
"
I did not purchase my products from Amazon, I purchased from an authorized retailer, but they aren’t posting my review so I am posting here too. DO NOT buy devacurl products! I have lost probably 1/3 at least of my hair from these products, my hair is damaged, it hardly curls anymore, my scalp was itchy/burning and I had a major dandruff problem while using these products. A simple google search will show you the controversy going on currently with devacurl. Don’t waste your money and don’t risk this happening to you! I believe at one time their products were good and that’s why the reviews are mostly good, but something has changed with their products and they aren’t what they used to be. Their reviews should reflect these changes. There is a current class action lawsuit forming against them for the damage they’ve caused to at least tens of thousands of people. Probably more. Don’t risk it happening to you too!
"
"
It looked like already used. Did not work like the original product I’ve bought before from a store.
"
"
So far, i like it. I used this and the matcha butter mask together. I just did the same amount of both finger-combed it through my hair and then rinsed out completely. My curls looked more defined and so far I am pleased with the product. I exclusively use DevaCurl products. I use the No Poo, One Condition, B'Leavin, Ultra Hold Gel. And on occasion, when my hair needs it i use the Micellar Cleansing thingy, and now I will be using the Deep Sea Repair and Matcha Butter Conditioning Mask on a regular basis but as needed. I also use the hairspray occasionally and I use the No Poo dry shampoo cleanser.
"
"
After one long treatment (1 hr, with the bowl method), I could not believe my hair was so curly. I thought I was a mixed 2B-3A, but I am now a solid 3B with 3C curls underneath. The top layer of my hair still needs more moisture conditioning masks, and Olaplex 3 treatments but I believe this is the curl pattern I was born with. My curls are shinier and smoother with less tangling. Of course, I still need styling product and use curly girl drying methods. I had already been using Deva cowash and conditioner for about 3 months by the time I tried this mask (previously was using Biolage cowash for curls). I have since used the mask 2 more times for 30 min.However, I noticed my hair was thinning after 6 months on Deva wash, and after 3 treatments of Deep Sea. I went to the dermo, had bloodwork and scalp biopsies, and she believes it is my Deva products based on the ingredients, so I have discontinued them and we are monitoring. In googling, there are many concerns similar to mine. But also many people who are doing really well with Deva products. The results can not be denied and I am very disappointed to give up this hair mask and cowash system, but that doesn't mean hair loss is true for everyone and if I had to do it over again, I would still try this, but just be more mindful in monitoring my hair density.  I still recommend this mask to someone who wants to get moisture, shape and shine back into their hair.I'm 50yrs old, with a few previous health issues that have affected the condition of my hair, but I'm on the other side of it in the last year. My dermatologist remarked that my hair and scalp are very healthy, aside from the thinning. I have been using Biotin 10k mg once a day for 4 years.
"
"
My hairdresser gave me a sample of this after giving me a balayage and I absolutely LOVED IT. The sample size (maybe 1oz?) lasted me over 4 months. I have generally straight, maybe slightly wavy hair but this actually gives me curls which I wasn’t even expecting. It repairs my bleached and damaged hair AND gives me curls?? Yeah, that’s why I bought the 8oz bottle on amazon.
"
"
I’m new to letting my curls curl. Needed conditioning and moisture. This has worked great
"
"
I used it for my frizzy hair.  Not helpful
"
"
This product dried my hair out and made it feel like seaweed. For days after I first used it my hair was crispy and felt like it had a weird residue on it. I wouldn’t recommend this product. I have used Heaven In Hair for a long time and was looking for a change but I went back to the other Deva products and threw this stuff out.
"
"
Moisturized and defined my curls. The product has to be left in hair for 20 minutes, so it is a bit of a process. I'll probably use it twice a month instead of the recommended once each week.
"
"
I don't see much of a difference in my very fine wavy colored damaged hair. Actually the first time I did a mask how it is suggested at the package, I felt my hair being dry. Use it sometimes now as a conditioner now.
"
"
So far so good! I am using this in conjunction with the other deep conditioning mask. It has made a noticeable difference to my low porosity, frizzy and fine, caucasian curly hair. Especially with high humidity during summer in FL.
"
"
I have super curly long dry thick hair, and this is a wonder product for me.  I can tell immediately after use by the softer texture of my hair that it has been moisturized and smoothed by this product.
"
"
I have dry, dull, brittle hair right now and this is helping me nurse it back to life even before getting my trims.
"
"
Has wheat (I’m allergic) and so full of fragrance it was unusable.
"
"
Under testing
"
"
Really happy this product. Great smell, nice size for the price, leaves my curl 2c to 3a super hydrated! Will be incorporating to my biweekly routine.
"
"
I liked it but needed to use more than recommended and my hair isn’t very long. Saw some results but nothing life changing
"
"
Makes my hair so soft! I love using the 1-2x/week. It really helps reverse or stop the drying damage.
"
"
Left my hair feeling very waxy.
"
"
I have wavy coarse hair and this product helped define my curls. My hair did not look as shiny as I expected after using it, but I can see more definition and it is super soft. I do like it and I feel it really nurtured my hair.
"
"
I love Deva Curls products, but none of the deep conditioners work for my hair. Leaves my hair really dry.
"
"
Love this product.  My hair looks amazing after using.  Not dry and frizzy.
"
"
Best deep conditioning treatment I’ve ever used on my 2c/3b waves and curls. Love this, will def repurchase.
"
"
Great treatment. Completely revives curly hair when used with heat. Love it.
"
"
Works great, my hair feels stronger after first use.
"
"
Amazing. Super sensitive to most devacurl products. Makes me break out in hives. But this product made my curls feel like curls again. Made my curls clump perfectly. Now it's a staple in my hair care routine.
"
"
Hair feels so soft and it smells great.
"
"
Works well on my mixed daughters' hair not convinced it's working on my hair.
"
"
Smells good and really does make a difference
"
"
This stuff is so amazingggg. It leaves my curls so soft and nourished, and the curls clump together and it makes my hair look amazinggg! I have 3c-4a curls and this stuff works like a charm
"
"
This stuff is amazing! Made my hair so soft.
"
"
Great
"
"
Perfect
"
"
Worked great.
"
"
love it
"
"
Great for dry colored hair. Love it
"
"
The best
"
"
My hair does not do well with the Deva Curl conditioners apparently. I order three different ones including this one.  It leaves my hair 3B feeling like dry straw. I actually had to use another conditioner to undo the hard feeling of the hair in the shower. Will not buy again.  Love the other products.
"
"
This smelled fresh and was sleek going on. But it didn't leave my hair feeling any more conditioned than my normal leave-in conditioner. I have medium curly hair (3B and 3C).
"
"
This product is great. I am a deep conditioning girl-- do it all the time for my color- treated hair-- which means I need a deep, deep, deep conditioner which this is. I have always been a devacurl girl so there was no convincing when I learned they developed a new conditioner in addition to their heaven in hair. I love this for wash and go, hair was so soft with no residue, can't wait to give it a go again. Plus, the smell is heavenly.
"
"
Deva curls mask product it works for my hair, it makes what differents how my hair feels. I'm so happy that Amazon has everything I need and best is two days shipping. Awesome!! really dont have nothing bad to say about Amazon.
"
"
Love love love!!! Works great brought my curls to life again!
"
"
Works immediately!! I don't have curly hair but fine thin hair and it gives me just the right amount of hydration I need. Can't comment for curly haired folks tho.
"
"
This is a PROTEIN treatment, not conditioning. You can use it with a conditioning treatment afterwards.
"
"
Its been about 10 months and im still not out.  I have thicccc hair gurl. And a tiny bit goes a long way. Feel the difference in a few days of using it. My hair is soft but not frizzy, healthy feeling and the curls are light and not heavy. IF DEVACURL EVER GOES OUT OF BUSINESS IM SHAVING MY HEAD bottom line.
"
"
So I started using this, saw good results. Then suddenly my scalp started flaking and itching madly. Hairline started to recede. I've never had this issue with DevaCurl before. My scalp is red and starting to blister
"
"
Love the product but packaging was awful, thrown in a box and the conditioner broke, got all over.
"
"
I love Deva Curl products, I used to straighten my curly hair all the time and really damaged it. The Deva Curl products have revitalized my curls!
"
"
I love Deva Curl products. I have long natural curly hair that is very dry so I’m always looking for products to add moisture.  I also really like the smell of diva curl products.  I like this better than a gel.
"
"
Got this really fast. Use it daily. Works great to keep my hair from getting frizzy.
"
"
Great product for my thick, dry, damaged curls. Now my hair has a lot less frizz and my curls are more manageable! The scent isn't bad but not my favorite. Overall I would definitely buy again!
"
"
I buy these three products individually a couple times a year.  I loved finding it in a set to save me money.  My curls love DevaCurl the best so I keep coming back. Recommended.
"
"
Love everything about it!  Wish it wasn't so expensive, but it works so well on my curly hair.
"
"
Curly Hair girls, look no further! Max Bolume with minimal frizz! Moisturizing and weightless all at once!

The DevaCurl Conditioner in this kit is awesome! However, the No Poo and styling cream are so-so. The No Poo is expensive for what it is and the styling cream isn't my jam. It's too heavy and weighs down my curls, it would be good to use as a touch up product for a night out but not everyday.
"
"
I can't believe I spend so much $ on these Deva Curl products.  But they make my and kids' hair so beautiful.  I will buy over and over.
"
"
Love this product! Works so well for my curly hair and love the smell. Thx for being on Amazon Prime.  It’s hard to find in our small town. You make it so nice and easy!
"
"
I absolutely love the DevaCurl products! My curls are so soft and less frizzy with these products. My hair loss is also reducing on these products as well.
"
"
Love this product! The way it was shipped could have been a little better. The shampoo was all over the bag it was sealed in.
"
"
Excellent for naturally curly hair
"
"
I always live DevaCurl products.  Unfortunately, in this order the cream container does not work.  I’ve tried for a few days but the pump doesn’t work and I haven’t figured out how to break into it yet.  Product is great but when spending this much I expect the containers/dispensers they come in to work.
"
"
Works well
"
"
I'm still in the process of evaluating the Diva curl system but feel this is a great product, especially for the price.
"
"
This product is perfect! I got it for my girlfriend and she loves it! It’s so much more affordable than in stores and other brands that don’t have economy sizes. It got her hair looking more full and less frizzy.
"
"
I love Deva! Nothing else to say.
"
"
I like this line of product for my curly hair.  It allows me super low maintenance hair styling by doing the work for me.  It doesnt smell super awesome but that chemical smell fades quickly in the shower.
"
"
I have dry think curly hair and this is what I swear by. I used to use the decadence level for the product but it was too heavy for my curls. I love the light feel and smell of this level
"
"
DevaCurl products are high quality, smell great and do the job. They are more expensive, but I find that I don't need to use a much product as some of the cheaper products.
"
"
I assume it will be great, but haven't tried it yet, I am nervous! I am using Deva no poo and one original conditioner, I use the gel but still get frizzy not extremely soft hair
"
"
I’ve been using DevaCurl products for over two years without switching products. I’ve never been able to do that without my hair needing a change. I will never use another product!!
"
"
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
"
"
I love the ease of using these products.  Also love how my hair is healthy and looks great!
"
"
Great products - using with styling creme when giving my hair a break from straightening.
"
"
Amazon box was intact but the product looked like this when I took it out of the box. Concerned and wondering if this is still ok to use.
"
"
I’m questioning if the conditioner was really deva curl. It does not work! I’ve pulled out so much of my hair using it!
"
"
The smell of the No-Poo is a bit intense, but it does what it says. My hair is in much better shape after using it for a few weeks.
"
"
This is the first time I'm using this product and it's amazing! It keeps my flyaways down for hours and my hair feeling fresh and smelling great.
"
"
One of the bottles arrived open and with some product leaked
"
"
Worth every penny
"
"
Love the product, my hair doesn't puff in the humidity and keeps it soft and curly.
"
"
I don't think my hair looked much better than before I started using it.  For the price, I was disappointed.
"
"
Very moisturizing & it helps my hair have more defined curls.
"
"
So good
"
"
It’s like magic on my hair!
"
"
Great product
"
"
Love it
"
"
Love this set! Such a great deal for 3 products I use every time I wash my hair. Shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean and moisturized and the curl cream helps my curls keep their shape with a lot less frizz. I always use Arc Angel gel after the cream for extra hold. I will definitely buy this again!
"
"
I have used this product for years and it works so well for my hair. It doesn’t leave a residue and won’t weight down your hair. Fresh clean scent and my curls are on point.
"
"
Great  product!  Atrocious packaging!! With what you charge for these products  I would at least expect to see bubble wrap and tighter bottle tops.
"
"
I have curly hair. This shampoo and conditioner are great for my hair. I use the Deva gel as well as the styling product here. My hair is very light not sticky. I only wash my hair every other day. My hair is soft and curly.
"
"
It works well but I do not like the smell at all. Didn’t realize it was different from the previous one I ordered or I would not have gotten such a large size.
"
"
I have fine thin slightly curly gray hair.  This product gives my hair back its curl, takes away friz and I like the scent. I have purchased this combo three times and it is so much cheaper on amazon than retail.
"
"
The moment BOTH my husband and I used this product we experienced major hair fall out when using this product. And it wasn’t one in a while, it was every single time we used it. Once we stopped using this product the fall out of hair stopped almost immediately.
"
"
My only dislike is that my 6 year old needs this product and she would love tear free, alas it’s not to be. I’m glad I finally found something worth every penny. Love the Deva Curl products!
"
"
Been using this product for many moons. Would highly recommend to anyone with hair that’s wavy to curly!
"
"
Doesn’t give me the wave I used to get from it.
"
"
I loved the non-suds cleanser and the conditioner!  The curl serum is too heavy and stiff for my hair.
"
"
Both of the lids and pumps on both containers were broken. Instead of the lid coming off the entire top, pump and all came off. It makes me wonder if I’m even buying Deva curl cream and that it’s something else placed in one of their containers.  I’m not able to entirely snap the tops back in and neither pump works.  I buy Deva products all the time, but I won’t be buying from this seller again.
"
"
I have tried so many different products yet I keep coming back to DevaCurl. I've tried everything from Shea Moisture to Curls to drugstore brands, and DevaCurl always wins. This stuff is amazing and through Amazon, you're getting a 2 for 1 deal (normally $28 per bottle). I use this with the B'Leav-in Miracle Curl Plumper and I love the combination. This defines my curls and cuts my frizz down a lot. It gives me enough hold for the day, so I definitely need to add more product the following days but I don't mind that. My hair doesn't get crunchy and the product allows my hair to move still feel very soft. I love this product and would totally recommend this.Update 2/7/2018 I have 2nd day hair and it still holds up as if I had just styled after washing it. So I can retract my initial statement that the hold only lasts for the day. For me, it definitely lasts 2 days, however I did take some steps to avoid frizz (sleeping with a silk scarf wrapped around my head).
"
"
I love this hair cream.  Love it.  Makes my curly hair look, feel, and smell amazing.  Be careful not to use too much or you will have crunchy curls...which I do not like.  One the second day, I spritz my hair with water and give it a few scrunches...good to go another day.
"
"
Deva curl Supercross Coconut Curl Styler was and is a super find for me.  My hair has gotten finer and thinner with age but it's still very curly.  This Deva product works wonders. It does not weigh down my hair at all.  I scrunch a pump or two into my hair.  It is not sticky and does not leave my hair stiff and crunchy. It styles my hair the way I want and eliminates the frizzies.
"
"
A definite must have if you have 3c to 4c curls.  This product is the perfect ""one and done"" styler.  It does exactly what it says if you apply as stated.  For a little extra hold for longevity, I strongly suggest DevaCurl's ARC ANGLE GEL.  Without it, 2 days max for great curl definition. With it, 2 weeks...your call!
"
"
This is the best styling cream I have found for my 3A type hair. I moved away from the Supercream to try other brands and products, but nothing works better for frizz and definition than the Supercream combined with the ArcAngel gel. By tying up my hair at night with a scrunchie and covering it with a Buff, I can get four days of shiny definition with only spraying some water on my hair for maintenance. I use leave-in conditioner, but the type of leave-in is not as important as the styling cream and gel. Of course, every curly girl has to find their own personal routine, but this is absolutely worth a try.
"
"
This is my ish!!!!!!!  My new favorite must have hair product. I'm a natural girl with 4b/4c texture hair.  When my hair is getting frizzy I take a kettle of this and smooth it into the frizzy pieces and the piece curls right up!  It only takes a little on your finger then press your finger to your thumb and run them down the piece of frizzy hair until it smooths out and curls it.  I can stretch my style for a few more days using this. I love it so much I keep the travel size in my purse.
"

I loved the Deva Styling Cream, so when they introduced the super cream I was skeptical.  How could they make something better?! They did. It smells better, and it works better on my curls. I can style with Supercream alone and have the same curl control and shape as I get with the original styling cream plus gel.
"
"
You definitely need another product to go with it like a gel or mousse because this product isn't enough to define and hold curls on its own. It does have a great scent, but I was disappointed that it doesn't define and hold curls better. Without an added gel or mousse on top of it, my hair is very frizzy.
"
"
I have thick hair, with type 3b curls. The creme worked well, but only if I used a lot - about 20 pumps. Anything less, and my hair was pure frizz. It would take 3 or 4 of these per month for my hair, so I switched to the ultra hold gel.
"
"
Both of the lids and pumps on both containers were broken. Instead of the lid coming off the entire top, pump and all came off. It makes me wonder if I’m even buying Deva curl cream and that it’s something else placed in one of their containers.  I’m not able to entirely snap the tops back in and neither pump works.  I buy Deva products all the time, but I won’t be buying from this seller again.

I have tried so many different products yet I keep coming back to DevaCurl. I've tried everything from Shea Moisture to Curls to drugstore brands, and DevaCurl always wins. This stuff is amazing and through Amazon, you're getting a 2 for 1 deal (normally $28 per bottle). I use this with the B'Leav-in Miracle Curl Plumper and I love the combination. This defines my curls and cuts my frizz down a lot. It gives me enough hold for the day, so I definitely need to add more product the following days but I don't mind that. My hair doesn't get crunchy and the product allows my hair to move still feel very soft. I love this product and would totally recommend this.Update 2/7/2018 I have 2nd day hair and it still holds up as if I had just styled after washing it. So I can retract my initial statement that the hold only lasts for the day. For me, it definitely lasts 2 days, however I did take some steps to avoid frizz (sleeping with a silk scarf wrapped around my head).
"
"
I love this hair cream.  Love it.  Makes my curly hair look, feel, and smell amazing.  Be careful not to use too much or you will have crunchy curls...which I do not like.  One the second day, I spritz my hair with water and give it a few scrunches...good to go another day.
"
"
Deva curl Supercross Coconut Curl Styler was and is a super find for me.  My hair has gotten finer and thinner with age but it's still very curly.  This Deva product works wonders. It does not weigh down my hair at all.  I scrunch a pump or two into my hair.  It is not sticky and does not leave my hair stiff and crunchy. It styles my hair the way I want and eliminates the frizzies.
"
"
A definite must have if you have 3c to 4c curls.  This product is the perfect ""one and done"" styler.  It does exactly what it says if you apply as stated.  For a little extra hold for longevity, I strongly suggest DevaCurl's ARC ANGLE GEL.  Without it, 2 days max for great curl definition. With it, 2 weeks...your call!
"
"
This is the best styling cream I have found for my 3A type hair. I moved away from the Supercream to try other brands and products, but nothing works better for frizz and definition than the Supercream combined with the ArcAngel gel. By tying up my hair at night with a scrunchie and covering it with a Buff, I can get four days of shiny definition with only spraying some water on my hair for maintenance. I use leave-in conditioner, but the type of leave-in is not as important as the styling cream and gel. Of course, every curly girl has to find their own personal routine, but this is absolutely worth a try.
"
"
This is my ish!!!!!!!  My new favorite must have hair product. I'm a natural girl with 4b/4c texture hair.  When my hair is getting frizzy I take a kettle of this and smooth it into the frizzy pieces and the piece curls right up!  It only takes a little on your finger then press your finger to your thumb and run them down the piece of frizzy hair until it smooths out and curls it.  I can stretch my style for a few more days using this. I love it so much I keep the travel size in my purse.

"
"
I actually have wavy hair, not super curly but it works great. My hair is pretty long and super dry. My hair is halfway down my back.  This makes my hair really soft and nicely defined. It is pretty expensive and I have to use about 5-6 pumps for my long and thick hair. It’s definitely worth the price though. I’ve never used anything better.
"
"
My favorite product that Deva Curl makes. 3 pumps in damp hair with a little hair oil makes my curls more defined and controls frizz all day long. Also the price is awesome. I have tried a ton of products for curly hair and this is the best yet. I have a lot baby fine curly hair and live in the South where the humidity ruins any hairstyle quickly when I step outside. The product does not leave your hair crunchy or weigh down your curls.
"
"
Honestly...coconut curl from Walmart works just as well for a fraction of the price. Save your money. This stuff is not that good.
"
"
This stuff is the HOLY GRAIL for my curly hair. I honestly didn't know how to embrace my curly hair until I found this product. It's my favorite devacurl product, and I am so glad they sell two at once
"
"
Love this hair product. I have curly hair and this is the only product I can use that isn't too heavy and leaves a greasy feel to my hair. Since I have fine curly hair I have troubles finding products that don't weigh down my curl. I have been using Deva Curl products for a few years now and swear by them!
"
"
Amazing product! Does not weigh hair down. I have thick, wavy, frizzy Latin hair and this is literally a miracle worker. Leaves my waves/curls nice and defined without looking crunchy, wet, or greasy!! Highly recommend for wavy, curly, kinky hair. It gives you great moisture and a little goes a long way!!
"
"
I love this stuff. I originally bought it in a set with the DevaCurl No-Poo Decadence Shampoo, OneCondition, and the DevaCurl gel, but quickly ran out of the trial size cream. I have fine 3b/c curls and this makes my hair soft and full. It helps my curls clump together so they're fluffy without being frizzy. People always comment on how good my hair smells, too. I have to use about 5-6 pumps and it's a small bottle. I've gone through about half a container in about 2 weeks, maybe a little less. It's pricey, but so far it's been worth it. (The No-Poo is honestly my favorite product out of the set. Makes my hair softer than any conditioner I've used.)
"
"
Fantastic product! I love how this goes on light, and keeps the frizz down. It lets me hair move, be soft and light, but still keeps it looking shiny and controlled.
"
"
Really good. I have a technique to make my curly hair super defined and I've been doing that for years, but with this product I practically don't have to do any efforts to get crazy definition. It's light but it has enough hold for my 3b curls.
"
"
Heavy for my wavy curly hair
"
"
This is Awesome.  I love it.
"
"
Order this for my wife. She tried it a few times and did not work. She was not happy
"
"
works very well - has softened my hair.  The coconut fragrance is a bit strong .
"
"
Love love love this product! I have very curly hair and this is the only product that works for my hair type. Finally don’t hate having curly hair get compliments all the time on my hair!
"
"
Have loved this product for several years,. Deva is the best for curly hair!
"
"
I am a huge fan of diva curl. If only I would have known about it when I was younger. My curls are defined, bouncy, and I feel the women stare at my hair (enviously) as I walk by. 😈  FYI, I used the deep sea repair mask and left it on my hair 15 mins. Rinsed it out, dried, and sprayed on Set it Free on wet hair. Then i scrunched in a combo of this Supercream and B'leavin, and diffused dry. Get a blowdryer with a cool shot to close the cuticle. Yes it sounds like a lot of work, but I won't was my hair again for 3-4 days.
"
"
Fantastic styling cream for my curly, grey hair. I put it on when my hair is wet, then style as directed. Smells fantastic and keeps my hair hydrated.
"
"
Works great for my wife’s natural hair. Just a little bit applied to wet hair lasts all day. Best product she has ever used.
"
"
This product is applied to my hair right after the Be'lieve In.  Very necessary for my very naturally dry and naturally curly hair!
"
"
Reading the reviews, i thought the product would transform my curls. The product does not justify the price at all
"
"
Fabulous product for adding texture to your curls without making them ""crunchy"".  I have ordered this product for over a year.
"
"
This is the best stuff ever. It smells great and my curls look so pretty
"
"
Oh how I love this stuff. ITS AMAZING. My daughter has beauitful curly hair all day long with two pumps after she showers it’s amazing !!!
"
"
I used Deva Curl products successfully for 2 years. October 2019- Feb 2020, something changed with their products. Over 35k women are experiencing hair loss.
"
"
The is the best product I have ever used for my curly hair.Keeps my curls from frizzing and in place.
"
"
This product is the holy Grail for my curly hair! It defines my curls and gets rid of frizz while being light enough that it doesn't weigh down my hair.
"
"
2 for less than the price one 1! Can’t beat that! Love this stuff and all Deva curl products!
"
"
I love this product, it’s great for calming curls and bringing them back to life!  Cheaper to buy on here as my salon wanted to charge $28 for one!  Very happy!
"
"
Perfect for my curls and nice scent!
"
"
A great product for curly hair. I have coarse curly hair. This is a clean and simple product.
"
"
Great for the price.
"
"
Great product. I just wish it came in larger sized! Seems inefficient and too much packaging to buy such small amounts.
"
"
This product works great on my curly hair!
"
"
Great for thick, curly hair.
"
"
So far this seems to be the same as what I normally purchase from Ulta for a fraction of the price!
"
"
Great product for curly hair! Smells great!
"
"
My favorite curl product.
"
"
Love this ! Great value on this purchase.  Will definitely order again
"
"
It wasn’t as I expected honestly i regret buying this deva cream .. its too heavy for my hear that gives me the oily feeling and worst curls ever
"
"
My absolute favorite Devacurl product, this is my holy grail for sure!
"
"
Love this product for me and my son moisturizers our curly heads with a little hold
"
"

Perfect. Using with the Deva shampoo and rinse
"
"
Love this stuff!

"
Love DevaCurl. Has changed my hair for the better!! I'll never use anything else.
"
"

"
"
Best product ever for very curly hair.

"
"
Holds without being super crunchy. Smells great too!
"
"
fair price
"
"
came as described
"
"
Great for my hair!!!
"
"
This stuff is awesome.  I loved it so much that I bought 4 more bottles.  Got my sister in law and daughter using it too.  Holds the curl without the crunch.  Helps tame the frizz too.
"
"
Styler works well for about half a day on my thick, curly hair, but it does not hold my curls all day in humid Florida weather.
"
"
I have been looking for a curly product for a while now. Since I found the deva curl I really love it. It works really good on my curls and the smell is very sweat. This is my third devacurl purchase.
"
"
Love this product.
"
"
World great every time I use it.
"
"
Hazel free transaction! Great Product !
"
"
I loved the product. My hair felt clean, shiny and it looked healthy. No frizz
"
"
this is the best stuff for my crazy curls!
"
"
I have super curly hair and live in FL. Works for taming about 95% of that FL frizz.
"
"
Devacurl Supercream enhances your look and brings out your natural curl.
"
"
This stuff is a miracle for naturally curly hair! No frizz, manageable curls, I won't use anything else.
"
"
Product is easy to use. Works well!No complaints
"
"
It makes my hair stink like old oil after a few hours of applying to my hair!
"
"
Great Product.  Keeps curls intact all day
"
"
Love this stuff!!!
"
"
Love it !
"
"
Product was exactly as described!
"
"
Great
"
"
perfect
"
"
Doesn't work on my hair like it did in the salon. But maybe that's the way I am using it.
"
"
Great price! My curls LOVE supercream!
"
"
No residue great moisture I just wish I could take the top off and use the last drop
"
"
just what I wanted
"
"
Works great, and brings out mynatural curl.
"
"
As expected
"
"
I was hoping that I could put this in my hair and leave out right away without any white residue, but that's exactly what I got.  It did not work for me, I requested a refund.
"
"
Super cream. NOT. Believe the bad hair videos you see on YouTube.  I wish I had
"
"
My hair loves this stuff!!!
"
"
Just what I wanted at a good price!!!
"
"
This product came shipped looking fine but when opened 1 bottle came apart at a seam before the top of bottle and was coming out in the bag.It was damaged in shipping I assume but not happy
"
"
I’ve bought this twice... it finishes after 7 squirts. I’m not interested in spending so much money for a product that yes, works miracles, but for one or two uses? I love it but I’ll be moving on.
"
"
Got a sample of this product and figured I would try it out. I have very straight, fine hair so this product is not targeted to my hair type, but I have to say it was amazing. My hair is usually pretty dry and this didn't leave a residue at all and made my hair extremely soft. Recommend it to anyone with dry hair, curly or straight.
"
"
This product works well but is very expensive. It is not available in any larger sizes. I have long thick hair and a 5oz container lasts a week. I will go back to using Mixed Chicks because it works the same for me and is cheaper. This is a good product but not worth the price for me. Perhaps for shorter or thinner hair it may worthwhile.

Cosmetics Central review. Not Devacurl or Amazon.Do NOT buy from Cosmetics Central. I ordered the Devacurl Supercream Coconut Curl Styler 5.1 Oz 2-pack from them and got a bait and switch. They sent me the 3 oz set of Devacurl sample bottles, and when I asked how they wanted to go about fixing the mistake, they didn't offer a refund or free exchange, instead they wrote suggesting that I only get a refund for $8 (so I would pay $20 for an unwanted sample set) and then repurchase the $30 2-pack coconut cream. Uhm, what? No. Sent back a reply saying that was unreasonable. If I wanted the sample set, I would have ordered it in the first place. A few days later, they issued an $8 refund, so I called Amazon customer service. The representative handled it perfectly. She listened, understood where I was coming from, checked all of the details and saw I was correct, and issued a full refund on the remaining balance. She even suggested donating the set or giving it to a friend. I love the Devacurl line, so that's a great idea. I was ready to throw the un-touched set away.Amazon customer service: 5 stars.Devacurl products: 5 stars.Cosmetics Central: 0 stars. Amazon won't let me give them less than 1.Review of the Devacurl products:Love them. I've been using the no-poo shampoo and conditioner with the coconut cream styler for months. It's transformed my auburn curls. On another purchase, I accidentally purchased a giant bottle of Devacurl gel, thinking it was the coconut cream. Nope. But it was my mistake and a happy one at that. Even with the drying properties of gel, my hair is hydrated and now the curls last even longer with a stronger definition, up to three days with perfect curls. Without the gel, I had perfect curls for one day and for the next two days, my hair was curly, but without the definition. The gel changed that. The only other thing that makes a critical difference is using a microfiber hair towel after washing my hair. So if you are debating on the products, I highly recommend them (and am given loads of real life compliments and constantly asked what I use). If you are debating the seller, do NOT buy from Cosmetics Central.
"
"
This is completely different than any other curly hair product. As soon I've applied to my hair I felt the difference. It gives texture to the hair, loose curls, NOT clumps of hair pieces.Whoever created this product knew about curly hair. The best part: NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS.
"
"
I have recently switched to DevaCurl products and guuuuuuuuuuurl let me tell you, this curling cream is AMAZING. It does smell like coconut, but it is pleasant not overpowering. My boyfriend HATES the smell of coconut and is super sensitive to smell, but he hasn't noticed anything, so THAT SHOULD SAY SOMETHING. This product also keeps my hair nice and bouncy, but doesn't weigh my hair down. It is now part of my curly hair routine and I just can't live without it now. My hair is just healthier and happier and more ALIVE now. Thanks DevaCurl!!!!!
"
"
After trying so many different curl creams, gels and or mousses, DevaCurl's Coconut Curl Styler works best for my high porosity 2c/3A dark brown hair the best. I apply this product on sopping wet hair which seems to curtail the frizz best. This creamy product glides and easily coats my wet hair strands well. It has a light coconut fragrance that's not off-putting - I try to find fragrance-free options so this was acceptable.Everyone's hair is so different and responds differently to each product that it's a trial in error to figure out what works best for each of us. This sort of review is really subjective thus can be really misleading to someone whose hair is different which then affects the outcome of the rating.
"
"
Is this really Devacurl?!! Look at the pictures side by side, why is this sellers label so different from Devacurl's label listed on their website? This is nothing like the devacurl super cream coconut product I've used in the past 2 years. I don't believe this is the same formula that Devacurl makes.
"
"
My fine curls look better than ever.  I have never been able to have 2nd day wash-n-go hair due to my very soft texture.  This product allows me to keep my curl definition a second day.  I don’t have to use a separate leave-in conditioner.  I’ve received more complements on my hair since using this product.
"
"
This product is great for moisturizing my hair for a wash and go with ought leaving a residue feeling on my hair.  It paired with other Devacurl products are an ideal mix for my hair.  I have a mix of 3B/3C curl patterns in my hair in different sections and have struggled to find products that are agreeable with both sides of my hair until now.
"
"
Yessssss! love this product! My curly/wavy hair tends to get very dry and then all ^&*@ breaks loose. This product allowed me to go a few days between washing because I could reactivate the curls with some water, finger comb this product through it, scrunch it, and go. Soft shiny curls that smell so good!
"
"
Love! Love! Love! This smells so good and works wonderfully. My 14 year old son loves it for his hair as well. It gives him frizz free curls that are soft and smell good. :)
"
"
I have pretty curly hair and have had issues finding a styler that controls frizz but doesn't make my hair frizzy.  This product is the perfect middle ground.  My hair is touch-ably soft and not crunchy at all.  You can use more or less product depending on how much frizz control you want.  When I wash my hair after using it, it actually feels more moisturized than usual (so it doesn't dry your hair out!).  The smell is a light coconut and very present.
"
"
The Supercream helps define my curls without weighing them down. My hair is really thick and requires a rich product to create optimum definition. The downside is i need to use ⅓ of the bottle per wash, so the product goes quick, and it's expensive. It would help to get more quantity for the money. I'll keep using it until I find a more affordable product. Oh, and did I say I do really love the coconut scent!?!
"
"
I love this stuff. Smells amazing & my husband likes it- says I smell like the beach. Love how it makes my hair look and I especially like that i can put it in my hair on non-wash days and it collects the frizz. I will be reordering this.
"
"
I am not sure why, but the top of the container where the product come out, are broken off.perhaps the freezing temps...not sure...Can not use them as is
"
"
I like this cream but I'm not quite in love.  Mostly keeps frizz down on day 1.  Soft, not sticky or stiff.  Smells good.  I have shoulder length curls and I use two to three pumps.  I've also used it on dry hair but not crazy about the crackly feel to my hair.
"
"
Love this stuff! It's pricey but worth every penny. My hair is so much smoother, less fizzy and manageable when I use this.
"
"
First get a Deva haircut. Then get ready to really love your curls. NooPoo shampoo and this conditioner for maintenance. Your hair will thank you. Very popular in my family.
"
"
I like how it leaves my hair soft not crunchy or slimy to the touch.  It leaves hair smooth not frizzy and holds the curl pretty well as long as it's not messed with.My hair is thick and shoulder to upper laid-back length.  I don't like that I need to use 15 squirts to get through it all.
"
"
Great product for dry curly hair.  I have been using this product for quite some time now and I am very happy that it does not weigh down the hair.  Soft natural look.
"
"
This product is so lightweight and powerful. My curls are super defined and bouncy and look very hydrated. It doesn't make it feel crunchy like other products I've tried. By far the best styling product for curly hair I've tried. I will definitely reorder.
"
"
The deal made it seem like this product was fake. 2 for one? I'd say it's the real deal. I've never had hair that is so defined and bouncy. Doesn't make my hair greasy, and OMG it smells so amazing!
"
"
Deva Curl is the only product I use in my hair.  It makes my hair shiny and bouncy and is not out of control.  Love Love Love this product.  buying on Amazon is cheaper than in the store.
"
"
Love this stuff. I have type 3b hair, and this product keeps my hair looking shiny and moisturized. Only problem is it goes soooo quickly. I have long hair, and it costs too much for me to make it my everyday product.
"
"
This is the best hair product I have ever used for my spiraly very curly hair.  It is a great moisturizer and leaves my hair feeling soft with very nice curls and very little frizz if any.
"
"
I have super curly hair and love this product and the whole line.  Not a strong smell either.  I have received many complements on the smell of my hair.  Definelty recommend
"
"
Works wonders on my hair. I really like this product.
"
"
I love all their products.  This just firms the curl and smells SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!
"
"
This is the best product I have found for my frizzy curly hair. It leaves curls with nice form and doesn't weigh it down. It doesn't leave my hair feeling dirty.
"
"
I have been using this product for years! Love it and cheaper than buying at the beauty supply store!
"
"
Love this product!  Great price.  Shipping was slow for this product.
"
"
My favorite product for my naturally curly hair. I won't use anything else but DevaCurl products
"
"
AmaIng price for this set. Will buy again!
"
"
love this product and so does my hair. I would recommend for anyone with wavy or curly hair.
"
"
Perfect for curly dry hair.
"
"
Great hair product! Great price as well!
"
"
didn't work for me, but everyone's hair is different.  I still use 2 deva products, just had to find the right one for me!
"
"
This is a great product for my 3ab hair, not too heavy nor too light. Always arrives before time and sealed and I’ll keep on ordering if the great service continues👍
"
"
Excellent product as expected
"
"
The supercream is amazing for any curly girl.  You won't be disappointed.  You will have to figure out the amounts.  It smells amazing!  I've purchased it several times.
"
"
I have coarse curly hair, this product does a nice job of softly defining curls without making my hair stiff. And I like how it smells!
"
"
I’ve been using devacurl products for years and I love most of their products. Product performs as stated on the container.
"
"
love these products
"
"
This is probably my favorite hair product for my curls!
"
"
Love this product! Works great to keep the frizz down and brings out the curls.
"
"
HEAVY
"
"
This was a gift for my sister who has curly hair, she LOVED it and said it also smells fantastic. Arrived super fast too.
"
"
Excellent Product!  It really does work with my wavy/curly hair and helps to limit ""frizz"" and still keeps my hair light.
"
"
Ordered a 2 pack and received only 1.
"
"
we love this product !
"
"
Great product; one pump worked and the other fell apart
"
"
My holy grail.
"
"
Mixed with the Deva gel this stuff is amazing.
"
"
Great!
"
"
Best product for curl I have ever used!
"
"
Great produce for enhancing curls!

"
"
Love. Helps elongate curls without being stiff or sticky.
"
"

"
"
Was so glad I found the 2-pack. I love Devacurl products but they can be VERY expensive! Arrived quickly and the items were as described.
"
"
Perfect for my daughter's curls
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Curl gold. Only took off a star because of how pricy it is
"

"
"
Can't live without it! makes my curls soft and bouncy
"
"
Enjoy this product, is the best for curl's
"
"
Love my DevaCurl products.
"
"
Had for 2 weeks already ruined! Cannot use on regular dryer because it will get too hot and melt! Horrible product..cheap plastic!
"
"
 I am so glad I purchased this! I uploaded a video for those who want to know how it actually fits onto my hairdryer, as I saw people had issues with it. I love this attachment and am very pleased with the results!!
"
"
So everyone keeps complaining about it melting but it clearly states on the insert that comes in the box to use the DevaFuser on lowest the heat setting. Also, it will fit a regular blow dryer if you slide the elastic band up. Come on people! Its an awesome product! It does what it says it will do!
"
"
I would have given it 5 stars if the green rubber band that holds it on the dryer had not snapped after using only a few times, rendering it useless, since it no longer stays attached to my dryer. For the price, it should last indefinitely or at least come with an extra band and a way to order more when needed. Thank you to Amazon customer service for working with me on the issue, and issuing a refund for this item.
"
"
Love it! This dries from the inside outward so your ends won't be frizzy and fried by the time your roots are dry. Your curls will be beautiful with a ton of volume, so worth the price!
"

...but as a hairstylist I own different hairdryers.  The BioIonic, T3, Instyler and GemForce.  It fit very easily on my BioIonic and GemForce.  I loved how my client's hair turned out.  The DevaCurl Devafuser hand cradled her curls nicely while drying.  Then I decided to retry to fit it on my Instyler and T3 which has 2"" size nozzles.  I stretched the base of the DevaCurl Devafuser and I finally got it to fit.  It's like a brand new pair of shoes, it just needs to be stretched a bit.  What I really like is the rubber stretch grip on the bottom.  Whereas my other diffusers would come out during a styling service, this rubber grip stays put.  So far so good.  I first saw this at Ulta for $50 but Amazon has the best price.  You'll be ahead of your peers and you'll get lots of other clients turning their heads to look at your cool gadget.  Very happy with my purchase!

Says it fits most blowsdryers. I have three different blowsdryers. Any defusers I have previously used have fit all three. Deva curl devafuser fits NONE of them 👎👎
"
"
It will fit your dryer, just push up the rubber band.
"
"
The product melted after a few usesthe quality is extremely bad
"
"
Loved it for the first 3 times I used it, then It melted and became deformed. Kinda pissed as I spent $40 on this ""quality"" product.
"
"
Had for 2 weeks already ruined! Cannot use on regular dryer because it will get too hot and melt! Horrible product..cheap plastic!
"
"
 I am so glad I purchased this! I uploaded a video for those who want to know how it actually fits onto my hairdryer, as I saw people had issues with it. I love this attachment and am very pleased with the results!!
"
"
So everyone keeps complaining about it melting but it clearly states on the insert that comes in the box to use the DevaFuser on lowest the heat setting. Also, it will fit a regular blow dryer if you slide the elastic band up. Come on people! Its an awesome product! It does what it says it will do!
"
"
I would have given it 5 stars if the green rubber band that holds it on the dryer had not snapped after using only a few times, rendering it useless, since it no longer stays attached to my dryer. For the price, it should last indefinitely or at least come with an extra band and a way to order more when needed. Thank you to Amazon customer service for working with me on the issue, and issuing a refund for this item.
"
"
Love it! This dries from the inside outward so your ends won't be frizzy and fried by the time your roots are dry. Your curls will be beautiful with a ton of volume, so worth the price!

Broke apart and melted completely out of shape on high heat (of a normal blow dryer). The diffuser that came with the dryer hasn't melted...
"
"
Do not waste your money!! This one does not work nearly as well as the round diffuser. It took twice as long to dry my hair. Spend your money on a good hair dryer and a circular diffuser!! I was so excited when it arrived, but was quickly let down..
"
"
I like it, it works well. It freaked my family members out when I first got it as it looks like a hand but tis cool. Honestly I barely use it cuz blow drying my hair is a lot of work but when I do this is a good product. ( I saw Zendaya using this in a vid btw). It lost a star because I had to my a whole other blow dryer because the neck of my old hair dryer was too big for the defuser to fit on which was annoying. So know this does not fit on all hair dryers, if your hairdryer has a thin ""neck"" to it then u should be good. If not then this thing will just keep slipping off every 10 seconds.
"
"
Great packaging, love the results when i diffused. I got 2 one for me and my Bff. Took time to learn tricks, I usually let my 3b curls air dry between 30min-1 hour after applying product to wet hairPlus scrunching and then diffuse, less frizz and allows product to penetrate also curls take their shape. Recommend Revlon Rvdr5029 1875watt hair dryer. Yes it fits. Follow directions in box. Recommend it.
"
"
Sure. It was easy to use. But my old basic cup diffuser thing that came with my old hair dryer makes gorgeous curls and this... did .. not. I had visions of bouncy perfect curls from this hand shaped diffuser that would scrunch and dry and lift all at the same time, but it was sort of difficult to get used to and the ends of my hair would get tangled and sucked into that dryer intake and the end result was fluffy hair with no defined curls or waves and honestly felt like it took way longer than usual to dry. Did not work for me.
"
"
I liked the idea of this diffuser,  but it would not fit on any of my hairdryers. Apparently,  you need their hairdryer and I  couldn't justify the cost when I already have 2 perfectly good hairdryers plus a travel hairdryer; so back it went.
"
"
I have curly/ wavy hair that is always difficult to dry. The devaCurl attachment was amazing except the glue starts to melt at the high heat setting on my hairdryer. Then my conair dryer broke and I bought a new conair but the attachment doesn't fit so I don't really use it. It's great for getting into my hair to dry it but the glue holding the sides together for sure melts
"
"
Although the description of this product states it fits any hairdryer - it does not. I come with a stretchy band to attach it to the hairdryer. This was very hard to use and took quite some doing to get the band to stretch to fit around my normal size hairdryer. I had to get an extra set of hands to do this. After using it the first few times it stretched out and was easier to use. Then after using it less than a dozen times the green stretchy band broke. Now there is no way to attach it to my hair dryer. It was a total waste of money. My cheaper hair diffuser worked just as well if not better and is much easier to use and connect to my dryer.
"
"
Like how it completes the job. My curls have volume and bounce. The product is not a product that will last. I have had it for three weeks and it has broken. Cannot return it because I already desposed of the box. Not happy with the product and the process to get to the final results.  It doesn’t fit well, I constantly have to push the attachment down while diffusing. This helps avoid the band to melt and the air flow to escape. Wish I could get my money back so I can buy another diffuser.
"
"
I LOVE THIS CURL-FUSER!!! I DID NOT PURCHASE IT WITH THE DEVACURL HAIR BLOW DRYER I THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO OVER PRICED. BUT IT TOTALLY WORKS WITH ANY UNIVERSAL HAIR BLOW DRYERS AND & DOES THE JOB 100%!!! OVERALL EASY TO USE, WORKS WONDERS AND I LOVE THE RESULTS!
"
"
I really like the idea of this, It doesn't fit my hair dryer. I was so excited to receive it and when I put it on my chi hair dryer, it kept sliding off. I did order a knock off one for $3.00. It looks like it has a bigger connector. (Fingers crossed), I  really had to rig this Devafuser, currently it is velcroed and duck taped. I was determined, haha. I do like what results I did get though.
"
"
I was very disappointed in this product and found it to be a waste of money.  The product advertises it's ""universal fit"" for MOST commercial hair dryers.  I wanted this product to help me blow dry my hair without taking out my waves, and help me enhance them.  but it popped right off my average size hair dryer that the majority of people have.  I then asked my roommates if I could borrow their hairdryers, thinking it must just be mine...IT DID NOT FIT ON ANY OF THEIRS EITHER.  Unbelievable.
"
"
Fantastic. Gently lift and dry the crown and then cup the curls in the “hand.” No more going to work with wet hair! And curls stay bouncy, not frizzy. I have no idea how people are melting this in some of the reviews. You are never supposed to blast curls with high heat. I have one for home, one for the gym, and now I’m getting one for my curly girl mum!
"
"
I used the diffuser once and it's completely deformed. I didn't even get to finish my hair. ☹️
"
"
I would not recommend buying this product for serveral reasons.First being that assembly onto a standard blow dryer is a nightmare. The rubber ring that comes with it is supposed to secure the attachment on your dryer, but in fact it’s almost impossible to get on. Once I had finally secured mine, it broke off 3 uses later.Second, the attachment is very flimsy when using with a regular dryer.I’ve had mine for 2 months now and have used it maybe 4 times, and am actually trying to find something else to replace it with.Quality is poor, and for that price unacceptable.I would recommend buying the knockoff for $3, at least when that breaks you won’t feel so bad and can replace it easier.
"
"
Yolanda’s review: I’m sure how this is supposed to work but I like it. It fits on both my blow dryers and is a real conversation piece; who knew?
"
"
I don’t know what I’d do without my devacurl diffuser!!!! I would have ugly frizzy hair, that’s for sure. The way this thing is designed may make it look a little scary, but trust me, it’s the bomb. When you hold your hair in the hand-like grip, it helps push the curls up and gives them volume.
"
"
Ok, so it looks crazy but it is really a smart design. I thought it would be a bit larger, but maybe I have a big head.The air is distributed in so many areas that it dries faster. And it circulates so well it infuses air into the curls. I love it!
"
"
Not sure why, but this very highly praised diffuser attachment really disappointed me. The air doesn't seem to actually reach my hair, which takes forever to dry anyway. Nothing special about this IMO. I've since purchased the Curlyco diffuser and really love it and get the results I was looking for. Another thing is everyone who sees this gives me the side-eye and says ""what the heck is that?!"". Another comment I got was, ""it looks creepy"". LOL! No shade to those that love it, though, just didn't work out for me.
"
"
I would recommend this product for every curly hair . Lightweight, easy to use, and dries my hair like no other tool . I spend 20 minutes maximum drying my hair with Devafuser .  Not to forget the gorgeous curls it creates!
"
"
I bought this for my daughter because she saw it in a Zendaya’s video, and at the same time I bought another dryer for me, at the end I kept this. Is amazing and worth every penny, if you are looking for an excellent tool for wavy or curly hair this is it, look no more. My only complaint is that it takes time for understand how to connect to my old hair dryer but after you got it this has the work done divinely.
"
"
I really, really, really dislike this diffuser and hate that I spent so much on it.  I find it difficult to ""wield"" and it just doesn't dry my hair, even at the roots where I wanted to use it to try to get some lift on top.  Perhaps it is a problem with the user (me) but I much prefer the cup kind of diffuser and can't recommend this one at all.
"
"
I didn’t not like this devafuser, although the it has the deva curl name attached to it, it doesn’t even fit the devadryer!! I would not recommend anyone to by this product!! I am a huge deva curl fan it has totally transformed my curls!! However if you are considering buying this devafuser just break open the bank and buy the dryer and defuser!! I am so disappointed in this product!!
"
"
I hate this diffuser- I have 3 blow dryers and this diffuser does not fit on any of them. I had to rig something to try and make it fit because I spent$30 plus dollars on this thing - so I used duct tape. It worked for the moment. But the diffuser is crap. I get nothing but FRIZZ with this diffuser. Don’t waste your money on anything deva curl. Their products don’t work for me- ever.
"
"
Was super excited to try this diffuser and have never been able to, sadly. I tried 5 different blow dryers and wasn't able to get it on a single one. I dont understand what the issue has been, but I spent a nice little chunk of change on something that's still sitting in the packaging in my bathroom cabinet 😔
"
"
I love this with the one exception that it slides off a million times while you’re trying to use it. Because you’re using it with a blow dryer it gets hot and it burns if you try to put it back on the blow dryer. My curls have never looked so good but that’s super annoying.
"
"
Doesn't fit, despite my blow dryer having a barrel circumference of 6.5 inches.  Even if I jam it on, the only thing keeping it there is a glorified rubber band.  It's not a tight seal, and so much air comes out the sides that hardly any air comes out of the actual diffuser.  This is getting returned.
"
"
I prefer a regular defuser because it is easier and faster. The devacurl fits fine on my hairdryer and the fingers are nice for lifting underneath curl sections and drying from two directions.  It is good quality but I gave it a three star because I don't use it. I procrastinated returning it thinking I would get used to it.  Once I figured out How to use it for my short hair I stopped using it because it took so much more time and the results were not significantly different then my old defuser.
"
"
The dryer has a cool concept, but 2 major problems:1) It is NOT universal. I have a standard sized blow dryer and it keeps popping off. Absolutely do not buy unless you have a small, super long nozzle.2) It cannot tolerate high heat. Which means that it takes forever to dry actually super curly hair since you can't go above low heat. The point of buying it was to DECREASE blow drying time and it has failed that test.
"
"
Ok, so it did not fit on my blow dryer, my dryer has a wider end.. So I need to buy a new blow dryer which I'm not totally thrilled about. I did try it.. but I had to hold it on my blow dryer as it wouldn't stay on.It did a pretty good job, I didn't dry my hair as long as I would have liked since it was hard to hold it on. I will update my review after I get a new dryer and try it out a few times.
"
"
I can't get this on my blo dryer, no matter how hard I try!!!
"
"
It was just okay. Having the hand in the end as the diffuser didn’t seem to make that big of a difference to drying and in fact, was a little cumbersome
"
"
This did not fit any of my current hair dryers, no matter how hard I pushed it on the end of nozzle. So, half of the drying power escapes before it reaches the end of the “hand”. Unfortunately, I waited too long to try it out, as I received it right before going on vacation, and am not able to return for a refund.Oh well. $50 down the drain.
"
"
It's ok if you can find a hair dryer it actually fits. However, I think I have more success with the basic diffuser my cheap hair dryer came with. I bought it hoping I could use it traveling, since it's supposed to be universal, but it definitely doesn't fit usual hotel hair dryers. I think on my trip, it maybe fit 1 out of about 10.
"
"
Do not waster your money on this device.  Could never properly use it because it would not stay on the hairdryer.  If you managed to slip it on it slipped right off.  The band that holds it on to the dryer broke and  now the device is useless.  What a waste of money!  I selected one star only because my review would not submit without a star rating.
"
"
Please do not purchase Devacurl products!! Many people report losing hair and complete damage to their hair. I unfortunately purchased many Devacurl products prior to making the connection with my scalp issues and have suffered from intense scalp issues and hair loss. There is a class action lawsuit with this company.
"
"
Disappointed. Does not stay on my blow dryer
"
"
I hate this thing.  It's a waste of time.  I'm better off blowing with a regular blow dryer.
"
"
Product broke after minimal use and I was I was apparently out of range for refund or replacement.  The rubber band that holds it to the blow dryer broke.  I don't recommend this product.
"
"
Works very well even on long and thick hair gets underneath very well and dries faster
"
"
I find a regular difuser easier to use
"
"
Was having a problem with my curly hair and this has really helped
"
"
Altered review!  I found a hairdryer to finally fit it!  I LOVE this diffuser!Love the function, but the fact that I can't find a hairdryer to attach it to is a letdown!  I have looked and looked... all the newer hairdryers have a much bigger barrel, and this won't fit.  :-(  I just hold it in place... which is tricky, and gets hot!
"
"
Great idea but did not fit on any of my blow dryers. Revlon travel, regular size, and Chi. Had to return and purchased a new system for $144.00. The entire system works great
"
"
The only reason I gave this lower rating was because I’ve had a hard time finding a blowdryer that fits it. The more budget-friendly dryers don’t fit. Otherwise I like it a lot
"
"
Use it for my hair to Keep kinky curly
"
"
it works great but does not fit any blow dryer only the one sold with like they said it would fit any dryer that is the only thing don't wont to pay over a 100.00 for a blow dryer
"
"
This really does create soft, tousled curls.  What I really love about it is that it gives great lift at the scalp without ruining the curl structure.  It gives a perfect amount of heat and air movement.  It will fit over just about any blow dryer.
"
"
I anxiously awaited this product as  my curly hair is short but I am growing it out.  I have tried many diffusers depending on whether I wear my hair short or curly.  I had high hopes for this one as I love the Deva styling products.  Unfortunately, I  struggled and struggled to get this to fit my Compact Vidal Sassoon dryer and no matter how I tried to attach it...it always flew off.  I do not want to purchase another dryer.
"
"
This fit snug on my basic blower. My curls look fantastic and I love to use this directly on my roots or while bunching up my hair.
"
"
Ridiculous.  Had to try it to know I had no use for it!
"
"
I found this unique diffuser while searching for a replacement diffuser for mine that had just died. I didn't see instructions included in the ad, so I purchased kind of blindly. Up until this product, I've only ever seen/known diffusers that are bowl or flat shaped but circular.I've had this product now about 2 weeks, and my fluency with the product may get better. If my results change drastically with time, I will update my review. My review is based upon my hair, which is naturally neither straight nor curly, but frizzy and puffy - very afro like without correct product & maintenance (currently use Ouidad for frizz & Kinky Kurly for curl).What I can say now, though, is this product definitely increases volume of my hair - and does this without impacting my hair's natural propensity to frizz. It does not, however, provide as much of a curl as the cup shaped diffusers, do. This may or may not be due to my use of the product, but the fact is that my hair curls more when placed in a curl type position while slowly drying, which the cup shaped diffuser naturally does. Using this hand shaped diffuser doesn't quite capture my hair in the same manner as the cup, but rather dries a wider area of hair. The fingers get the air into deeper parts of my scalp & thusly provides more fullness (as areas not normally reached by the air in a cup diffuser wouldn't get the impact that this product does by having finger-type thingies that pierce deeper).As for instructions - there weren't any detailed provided on the box, either, and were no instruction booklets. There were only a few pictures with key words next to the pictures posted on the actual box. For this reason, I leave my review open to interpretation (given the possibility of my not using the device to its fullest extent). As far as my understanding of this product, however, you used this attachment to your dryer as another hand. It took me awhile to get used to it - but I think I'm getting better now by scooping larger portions of my hair up with my non-blowdryer-holding-hand to position into this hand-type diffuser. This puts my hair moderately into the shape of a natural curl while drying and provides more curl than just using the diffuser as is. While doing this, the finger-thingies still dry area beyond the scrunched up hair - hence more fullness.I have tried my cup shaped diffuser since purchasing this, to confirm my impression that this device (while increasing fullness without adding frizziness, & providing minimal curl definition - more of a wave) didn't create as much of a curly-curl to my hair. I was correct, and the cup type diffuser did in fact provide thicker CURLS. That being said, the result with a cup shaped diffuser didn't reach the inner scalp area of my hair as this diffuser did, so the bigger curls just drop and hang (whereas with this device the minimal curls created do extend further out, as the diffusion goes straight to the scalp - explaining the full results).I anticipate my results will improve with time and fluidity of my hands/head while using this product. It may provide deeper curls if used differently, as there were approximately 4 different ways to use it depicted on the box. I can't figure out any other way to use this on my own, at least not significant differences outside tilting my head one way versus another. For this reason, this device may become better over time. As it currently stands, I'm alternating between my cup-shaped diffuser and this one.
"
"
I love this product - takes a bit to get the hang of it - dries hair exactly where you place - push hair
"
"
Have owned for over a year, and it is awesome for curly hair like mine! I had to find a blow dryer it fit with, but that took all of 15 minutes at Target. Great product!
"
"
The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I had trouble attaching it to my hair dryer. Because the elasticity of the band is so strong and tight I was afraid I was going to break it. But I pushed it on and it fit nice and snug.I used it on my twist out and it dried it well with very minimal frizz. I really like this product
"
"
I love it. I have had no issues and it really dries my hair quickly and with no friz.
"
"
Melted! I did use it on high setting because nothing at all seemed to come out on the low setting. I am just glad that it melted within the 30 days return period rather than gradually over time.
"
"
Great product and buy.  Fit perfectly and true to description and picture.
"
"
It was in perfect condition and everything. It just didn't work wonders like I thought it would.
"
"
Ok but not necessary, really. I prefer the Solano Universal Finger Softstyler Diffuser
"
"
Wow!!! I was very leary on getting this after reading reviews about it melting and etc but i still try thing's myself and I'm glad i did i love it!!!! And it fits my Revlon dryer
"
"
This was a gift for our daughter and says it's even better than she expected.
"
"
Awesome product I love the hand drying my curls super awesome
"
"
The band that holds the devafuser to my hair dryer split as soon as I put it on. Unfortunately I will need to replace that part soon. But it is brilliant in how it works!
"
"
Melted on the first use. I gave feedback in the first week.  Now they won't take it back. I loved it when my hairdresser used it.
"
"
Like it so far.. but wish it fit every dryer,, i had to buy another dryer just to try it hehe.. but over all i think its adding volume to my hair and making it look nice overall. will continue to use it to see more results.
"
"
If I could give this 0 stars I would. I love the Deva Curl products and was so excited to get this defuser to make my curls even better. The first time I used the defuser (on low heat and low power) it melted within the first 3 minutes. You can see in the picture where the plastic began to separate on the ""finger"" and melted through on the lower left side. I had to check my hair for melted plastic.
"
"
After I finally got it to fit over my blow dryer, it immediately came off once I started using it.  I have never been able to use it successfully. Poorly designed in my opinion.
"
"
Let me start by saying I've tried many different diffusers before this one. I have 3c/4a, very fine/flat curls. Normally when I diffuse, my hair is left a frizzy mess. I've resorted to sitting under a hooded dryer to avoid frizz. But then my hair dries super flat and weird.Not with the DevaFuser! I attach it to my blow dryer from another brand. It fits perfectly. My hair dries in record time, with little to no frizz. I even have some volume on day 1! I am really impressed. Give it a try. I hope it works just as well for you.
"
"
Great tool that works well but incredibly difficult to find a blow drier to fit it on to! Had to search for one with the smallest diameter nozzle I could find.  That was really annoying. It took me months!
"
"
Even though it doesn't make any sense I am amazed at the great results I get from this product!  I am more than happy with the results & highly recommend it!
"
"
Wasn't sure about this odd shaped diffuser at first but it does a good job.  It works like a hand scrunching up your hair as you dry it.
"
"
I have to say I LOVE Deva products...but this one, for me,  just doesn't cut it!I get much fuller curls with a regular diffuser on my regular old hair dryer.I'll be fair and say my type of curl is S(wavy) so maybe this works better on a tighter curl.
"
"
I first heard about this product from my hair stylist. She has curly hair just like me and even though I air-dry my hair during summer (I live in New York), I need to blow dry it during winter so I do not get sick. So I asked her what can I do during winter to dry my hair and get that va-va-voom curls without the frizz. She grabbed this oddly shaped item (the old version which has a square bottom not elastic). I thought this was just some weird sculpture they had but boy, was I wrong. She told me she has one at home as well as all the products form DevaCurl line and they're great for curly hair. After I got my haircut, she demonstrated on me. I was blown away (ha ha get it?). Anyway, she put a handful of mousse for my full head and gave it a slight scrunch and lifted it using this. At then end, using one of the fingers, she grabbed a few curls and separated my hair in the front and I felt like I just got a make-over. It was one of those ""SEXY"" hair moments and the result you see on the covers of the curly hair products and ads. So, I went home, went on Amazon, bought it right away. I use it with hair creams, lotions and milks . It works amazingly. If you have curly hair, get ready to feel like a million bucks.
"
"
According to the description this product fits most blow dryers on the market.  It didn't fit either of my dryers.  Had to return it without even getting to try it out.
"
"
The diffuser piece keeps popping off of my dryer while I'm doing my hair. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do.
"
"
This is a very effective diffuser, because it can sit inside the hair instead of just pushing from the ends.  Do you have thick hair?  You know how your ends get dry but the whole interior of your hair is still wet?  This fixes that problem.  It fit onto my regular blow dryer, I use high heat and low air.  It also works to introduce a little more volume because you lift the hair as it dries, this sort of stretches the roots so they don't curl up right onto your scalp.  It does both the job of a regular diffuser (press up from the ends) and drying and lifting the roots/inside part of hair (stick the ""fingers"" into your hair and lift up).  It blows hot air from both sides, not just the palm side, so the hair drys faster, too.  I don't have the kind of hair that gets all the way dry with a diffuser, and this one doesn't do it either, but it gets me to the 75% dry faster than a regular one, and MUCH more evenly dry.Yes it is big and awkward, but I find it gives my hair (thick-ish, coarse and wavy/curly, slow to get wet and slow to dry) much better results because it can dry the inside hair, instead of just drying the ends and outsides.  And can do this without much disruption to the curls.
"
"
After rave reviews I purchased this but was a bit disappointed...I actually prefer my circular diffuser much more
"
"
At first I didn’t know how to attach it to my blow dryer, but I later realized that it didn’t actually fit on the dryer. So I took the green band off & kind of forced it on. It works beautifully now.
"
"
I love my diffuser. Perfect for curly hair.
"
"
I was really looking forward to my DevaCurl DevaFuser as my hair dresser uses it and I was always impressed. After several weeks of using it daily, the diffuser began to melt and become deformed. After two months it is to the point where I can no longer use it as the plastic begins to liquefy when it is on my blow dryer. I do no understand why something intended to go on a hot blow dryer would me made out of plastic that melts at those temperatures. The concept is great, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired.
"
"
I've only used it once but it worked great. It doesn't leave curly hair as frizzy as with regular difusers.
"
"
I actually like the  way the air flows thru, but I have to use both hands to keep it from sliding off my travel blow dryer. It is too narrow to fit on my regular one.
"
"
Spouse says it it excellent, how can I argue with that....
"
"
i was so happt this piece is offered because the hair dryer is expensive. This piece fit my original blow dryer like a glove.
"
"
Shipping was super fast. I used the Devafuser for the first time this morning and my curls turned out BEAUTIFULLY and there is more lift in the roots than ever before.
"
"
Nothing special honestly. Don't ways your money. A regular diffuser will do the same job if not better with my experience

This is the best diffuser I’ve used for my type 2b waves. Takes a little bit longer to dry my hair (just past my shoulders and very thick) but well worth it for the end result.
"
"
This is not Universal. Will not fit my standard Conair hairdryer. Bummed. My hairdresser uses this and I love it but I can’t find an ‘everyday’ hairdryer that it fits. It’ll b going back
"
"
Not sure yet how I feel about it because I haven't had a chance to use it. When I try to attach it to my dryer, it feels like it's going to break. Like it's too small! I know the band around it stretches, but I'm worried I'll break it.
"
"
The band broke in less than a month, without it, it just keeps popping off like other ""universal"" diffusers. Of course it's now over the return period. They should include a few replacement bands at least.
"
"
Terrible, arrived in the product box but in nothing but a cushioned manilla envelope. The diffuser itself looked as though it had been melted. Completely damaged.
"
"
I REALLY wanted this. But it does not fit on my dryer. So it sits unused in the box. I'd love a return...
"
"
I can not live without this! This was my second and the rubber band has held up fine but the fingers are not lined up like they were when I first got it. This doesn't effect its performance but if it shifted much more I could see it possibly pulling som hairs.
"
"
Love the way you can dry the roots of your hair easier. Gives me a lot of volume
"
"
What a revelation for this curly girl! Bummed I had to wait until I'm in my 50's to have a product that works this well. Works better than the typical circular diffusers.
"
"
How disappointed I am that the Deva diffuser does NOT fit my hairdryer.  I was very excited to buy one after my stylist used one to do my hair. She did mention that the hairdryer and diffuser were sold together.  I am not paying for an expensive hair dryer so what shall I do? The attaching tube is extremely narrow and does not fit on my hairdryer or my husband's!Jody
"
"
Love this diffuser!! It fits all hairdryers, It makes it so easy to dry curly hair!
"
"
I didn't think that this would be easy to use but I was surprised that it actually is.  It dried the hair close to my scalp without frizzing the rest.  This is my go to diffuser from now on.
"
"
Removed all of my curl immediately. May work for really strong curls but for light waves forget it unless you want straight hair.
"
"
A little difficult to get on my dryer at first, but works well.
"
"
good product
"
"
I like the shape and how it curves to your head.  Great drying power.
"
"
i wanted to LOVE this produce and am always down for trying a curly hair product.  i had such high hopes.  I fully knew i'd probably have to buy a new hairdryers, which i did.  at least one that kinda fit this guy, and i fully expected it to be ackward until i got used to it.  i never quite bonded with it after using it for a week.My ""bowl"" diffuser (which came with the NEW hairdryer i purchased to work with this product) thankfully works great.  This product IS helpful if you have trouble drying underneath your hair, and IF your hair is shorter.  Mine is longer so it did not help me much.  i would NOT recommend and it does NOT fit MOST hairdryers, like the reviews say - the opening is VERY small.  it's an interesting item, and i continue to TRY to use it, but still go back to my bowl diffuser.I did not hate it, but it's not my go-to attachment either.
"
"
Bueno
"
"
No enough air goes through the holes.
"
"
This is way to large to handle.  I didn't clearly notice the dimensions and had a mental picture. Too much to handle, especially for medium length hair.
"
"
my wife loves this
"
"
Works as expected.
"
"
It looks like an alien hand but is great for diffusing curly hair - you can direct the airflow from inside the hair instead of trying to dry from the outside in.
"
"
Loveeeeee this diffuser!!! So glad i brought it on here for the better deal!
"
"
My hair dryer is within the size mentioned but this didn't even come close to fitting.
"
"
I think it is a great idea, but I can't get it to stay on my blow dryer.  I have the Conair 1875 and read a review that stated it fit perfectly.  I get it on, but it shoots off of the blow dryer after a couple minutes of use.  Very disappointed.
"
"
Love it. Works great! No issues at all with it.
"
"
Not a fan of this--I'd prefer the regular round diffusers that most hair-dryers come with. But I do LOVE the DevaCurl no-poo shampoo, conditioner, and hair products!
"
"
It was missing the piece that holds it on the hair dryer. It’s useless without it. Doesn’t stay on.
"
"
Works great! I love that it’s universal so I can use it on my hairdryer instead of going and spending big $ on the deva dryer. Definitely worth it.
"
"
do not recommend - more of a gadget than a useful product
"
"
Doesn't fit my dryer, I already have returned two dryers I purchased! I do not want to invest the money in the Deva dryer until I try the devafuser.
"
"
This diffuser kept my curls/coils intact! When I was initially trying to attach it on my dryer I thought it wasn't going to fit but the attachment actually stretches enough and is very snug on my hand held blow dryer.
"
"
""Universal"" was still too small for my dryer
"
"
It doesn’t always stay on my hair dryer, but it definitely dries my hair well and at the root without extra frizz.
"
"
Still learning how to use this but so far it's good not meant to use with hot setting!!
"
"
Love how the ""fingers"" can get under the layers of my hair. Best diffuser I've used. Cheaper ones have made my hair frizzy.
"
"
Short and to the point. I have thick, curly hair and it made my curls look sloppy and frizzy. Would not recommend.
"
"
Didn't work on blow dryer easy to return
"
"
Didn't work for me.
"
"
I have gone through at least 4 of these trying to ""get one that lasts & works"".It melts, cracks & eventually just falls apart. In theory, it is an appealing design but in actuality - it fails!
"
"
Love the Deva Diffuser. It works great for my medium/ long curls and dries fast even on cool setting. It fits my much older model baby bliss no problem.
"
"
It states that it ""fits most hair dryers"" however  it didn't fit the one I have .  I tried 6 different dryers at a local store just to find ONE that fit.
"
"
Terrible design. You need a blow dryer with a long nozzle, do not waste your money otherwise
"
"
Love this it puts other defuses 2 shame
"
"
Thanks..! nice and handy..! but don't  used in high hot speed remember plastic melt...! Be Careful..!
"
"
It works great for drying your roots first and leaving less friz.
"
"
Best diffuser I've ever owned and I've tried about 6 million different ones before springing for this one.
"
"
If you have naturally curly hair this will be your new best friend.  Got it at a great price! No frizz!
"
"
I don't know as I gave as a gift and did not se this product myself
"
"
The comcept of this diffuser looked amazing to me, I though it will be the end of my head hanging down to dry my hair, but that is not the case. It has taken me a wile to get dissent  results . Overal I think this product at three times more expensive is not woth the money.
"
"
It doesn't fit my hair dryer, so now I have a diffuser I can't use. I can't find a way to buy the deva hair dryer without the diffuser, nor can I find a list of compatible hair dryers. Really, really frustrating!!
"
"
Great product
"
"
Super cool works great in the middle of my hair as well on the out sides. It's a little bulky but a great product
"
"
I have loose curly hair and this defuser gives me great volume and less frizz compared to a flat defuser.
"
"
Mine didn't come with that bottom flare piece!Can't use, won't fit on any blower.
"
"
i wish i had been warned that this would not fit my blow dryer before i bought it! i cant find a place to buy the blow dryer separately either.  all the devacurl blow dryers i am seeing are super expensive and include this diffuser.  they should definitely make this diffuser more compatible with other brands or warn you that the elastic band is not stretchy AT ALL. i feel like i wasted my money :-(
"
"
Worked pretty well. But the rubber section broke after a few uses. Says universal, but that’s a stretch. Literally.
"
"
Cute idea but not enough air flow and awkward to use.  I used a few times and went back to my diffuser dryer.
"
"
Not quite as I had expected. The fingers do not seem curled enough to get in and under your hsir.
"
"
Doesn't fit on my hair at all well
"
"
Really love it. Fit my dryer perfectly. My curls look so different than the did with other diffusers, less frizzy, more natural.
"
"
This natural design helps keep my hair from getting frizzy.
"
"
band on the dryer broke after about a month.  now it won't stay on the hair dryer and is in effective useless.
"
"
Made my naturally curly hair more frizzy. A regular diffuser worked much better. Think it would work best if someone else was drying your hair with this product, as it was a bit cumbersome to manipulate.
"
"
If you have any natural curl to your hair then this is the diffuser for you.  I can't believe how amazingly curly this diffuser makes my hair.  I Love, Love, Love it!
"
"
If you do chose to put this diffuser on another hair-dryer (vs. buying the full DC hair dryer,) it is absolutely crucial that you use only on the COLD setting. This is of course assuming that you are using all Deva-Curl products as well!
"
"
Different, but it works!
"
"
Arrived as promised and on time. The problem is that it does not stay attached to my professional Babyliss Pro V1 Volare  Hair Dryer. It slips off.
"
"
I absolutely love this, makes my hair really full!!  Fits on most blow dryers.
"
"
Gets into the roots with out making everything frizzy but difficult to get and keep on regular sized blow dryer.
"
"
I love this defuser!  I never used a blow dryer in the past because my hear would frizz. No frizz with this defuser.
"
"
Really didn't see any improvement over my regular defuser. In fact a little worse, as when you stick it under/inside your hair it just blows the canopy into a frizz... I'm returning it.
"
"
Thought I would use it alot, but I don't.. Hair looks better when I let it air dry.
"
"
it didn't really fit my blow-dryer, but I still manage to make it fit a little bit.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
I love this, I had one of the original ones and it broke and didn't hesitate to order a new one. I love the new design and how I don't have to go out in the cold Maine winters with wet curly hair.
"
"
Not easy to use.  Hair slides off of it when trying to dry.
"
"
i went to a hair stylist that used it on my hair and pointed out so many benefits to having this diffuser.  my problem with it is that it says it fits most blow dryers. Not True. i have 2 dryers in my home and it kept popping off, i took it to the store to find a dryer that it would fit and the ones with the narrow barrel cost around $100. So i thought that if I'm going to spend that much money, i might as well get the Deva dryer & diffuser kit. I mailed the devafuser back at a loss (I paid shipping to return it).. I have since purchased the dryer/ diffuser combo kit. No problems with fit. The dryer is truly a high quality product, it drys my hair quickly, and my hair feels and looks beautiful. Don't waste your time with this devafuser hand. Get the combo set
"
"
Love how it works the curls....Hate the design.  It's getting ready to fall apart.  As much as these things cost they should have a better design.It's not the oversized rubber band that is the issue - It's the frail plastic pieces inside the rubber band that are obviously not made for heat from a hair dryer.  They have warped and are wearing.  I had to buy a different hair dryer because it's to the point if I remover the diffuser one more time I won't be able to get it back on the hair dryer or it's going to break.  That is an inconvenience...Hopefully they will re-work their design and/or drop their prices.
"
"
I don't think it did any better job than my regular diffuser.  I ended up returning it.
"
"
This diffuser is terrible. Just use a regular diffuser.
"
"
So dissapointed with my order! Looks nothing like the devafuser. The hand is all twisted and looks deformed and looks absolutely smaller than anticipated! Thats what happens when you try to save a few bucks. My advice.. Stick to ORIGINAL! This is not original... AT ALL!
"
"
Great item
"
"
My hair has been changing from straight to wavy for the past couple of years, and I had no idea what to do with it, as with the slightest humidity would become frizzy.I had been reading about DevaCurl and thought of giving it a try, buying the fuser which I use with my old hair dryer. Nailed it! It's so easy to use, I can blow dry my hair without the frizziness or the need to use any other tool. As long as I don't mess with it afterwards, it remains wavy for the rest of the day. I had my doubts because many people complained about the fuser melting, well, that did not happen with my old con air dryer. I would definitely recommend this product.
"
"
this does not fit my blow dryer
"
"
Though I have a full head of curly hair, I always hated using defusers with my hairdryer. They are bulky, they take so much time and they just are hard to maneuver. This DevaCurl one though is easier for me to maneuver and now that I got it, I am constantly using it.  I love that it feels like a hand and I can position it the way I would my hand and scrunch the hear and hold it in a certain position as it drys.  I like it.
"
"
Great for drying  curly hair without messing it up.
"
"
Gives great body!
"
"
Over priced!! Takes too long to dry your curls. A round defuser works much better!! Disappointed!
"
"
I can't imagine this fitting on any hair dryer.  The opening is so small! I have to return.  Unfortunately I couldn't even test the product to see if I like the results.
"
"
Does not fit most hairdryers.
"
"
Was difficult to find dryer that it would fit.Also,not good unless your hair is at least shoulder length. Could not use it on my shorter cut curls.
"
"
This product is falsely advertised as it does but fit regular hair dryers.
"
"
Amazing product!  Works just as described.
"
"
Don't buy this. As a user of DevaCurl products for over a year - I was excited to try this since all their products are amazeballs. This, however, sucketh. Left my hair LESS curly and not as much volume as I get with my regular diffuser.
"
"
This will not fit 2 different dryers I have. It is supposed to be universal, and you can't purchase the dryer to this separate.
"
"
Its fun and it works great!
"
"
Arrived quickly, and looked like it was supposed to. However, it was too small, and didn't fit my hairdryer.
"
"
I bought this item for my nieces birthday..she raves at how great this product works..
"
"
I am unable to return it as i crossed the 30 day timeline - but this diffuser does not fit well also started melting. eventually even broke
"
"
I've used round diffusers for years, so when I saw this, I thought it would be fun and interesting to try something different.  Sorry, but compared to a traditional round diffuser, for me, this gadget is a joke.  Perhaps I didn't use it correctly, so I gave it an extra star just in case I'm the culprit.  But it deserves a single star in my book.  I returned it and happily returned to my old, round diffuser.  Sometimes the next bright, shiny object is just that.
"
"
Love love love ...my hair is so much shinier and bouncy
"
"
i love it it is a good productthank you for it I will recommend it to my friend .
"
"
Adds volume...curls dry soft and cute
"
"
It's ok doesn't stay on nothing that a good old  fashion  diffuser could do.
"
"
Just perfect
"
"
Best tool for curly hair I've ever had ..!!!
"
"
Works well. Fits fine on dryer. No problems
"
"
Helps my hair curl beautifully
"
"
Does not fit on the typica blow dryer so sucks
"
"
The original ""hand"" fit any hair dryer with the attachment.  This one is still in the box because I can't find a reasonably priced hairdryer with a small enough shaft for the hand to actually go on.
"
"
Returning .disappointed. is not a universal fir as stated..
"
"
Love it
"
"
I too was unable to get the attachment to fit. It fit over the dryer but did not stay in place.
"
"
Didn’t fit on either of my hairdryers. The elastic band kept sliding it off. Very disappointed.
"
"
Great product but unfortunately did not fit my Conair Infiniti Pro 2000 hair dryer.
"
"
Helps reduce frizz
"
"
I prefer the regular diffuser, I would've returned it but didn't have the time
"
"
An added note:  works perfectly on my Babyliss folding travel dryer.received this a few weeks ago and I love it.  I have medium curly, fine, chin length hair and it works great for me.  Use it near the scalp on low for some lift and volume, plus use it to ""cradle"" top, sides and back to finish drying process.  I really did have more, bouncier curls when used with the right producs for my hair type.
"
"
I love this attachment! I have very curly hair and I can now go out with a dry head with no frizz!!
"
"
This DevaFuser didn't do anything remarkable enough to justify the price. I was surprised as their products are generally very good.  Disappointed with the results, I passed it along to my Sister.  My Sis followed the instructions and watched the Youtube instructional vids, to no avail. We've both had better results,  when in a pinch and we used a sock at the end of the hair dryer! Note: the sock can cause the dryer to overheat.  Save your money and buy a regular diffuser.
"
"
Unfortunately this diffuser, which looks like a great design does is not actually made to fit 'most dryers.'  I have yet to find a list of dryers this diffuser fits on.  Strangely, the box does not contain any instructions on how they suggest getting it on. Most reviewers discuss how hard it is to put on their dryer!  I'm going to try to get a babyblisspro dryer, as one person mentioned it fit. But pretty disappointing generally.
"
"
Product is working well but had to find a dryer to fit the small attachment opening.
"
"
Fits my revlon dryer well. Great for drying curly hair and adding volume to the roots. Slightly more frizz than using a helmet diffuser, but gets to the undersides of thick hair much easier so faster drying times. And much more portable than a helmet diffuser, of course.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Did not work as expected. It’s alright.
"
"
It started melting the first time I used it! Now one of the fingers is almost completed melted and it gets stuck in my hair ! I would not recommend this to anyone
"
"
I have wavy curly hair.  I recently started using the devacurl line about a month ago.  But my curls were still kind of frizzy and falling flat by the end of the day.  So I thought I would give this hand a try.  First off, it didn't fit on any of the 3 blow dryers I have, so they really shouldn't say it fits ""most"" hairdryers.  But I have one of those Conair round brush blowdryers, and it fit perfectly on that.  I used it this morning, and I am so impressed!  My curls are more spiraly (if that is a word), and there is barely any frizz.  This made such a HUGE difference!  I would highly recommend it, but don't expect it to fit on your blow dryer unless you have one with a really skinny nozzle.
"
"
Gives my hair curls and volume, and no frizz
"
"
Okay, this turned out to be a long overdue purchase, but I'm glad I finally bought it.  Use it on my hairdryer, regardless of some reviews saying it melted.  I use mine in Med heat only but use the power on high.  It take a little elbow grease and care when putting the DevaFuser on, just take your time and guide the notches from the rubber band around the sleeve and boom, Happy curls!
"
"
Love the product, worked on my blow dryer!
"
"
Did not fit my standard size blow dryer, so I could not even try it. Sending it back. :(
"
"
I love the way it defines my curls. Does away with the frizz and I have gotten a lot of compliments on my hair since I've started using it.
"
"
It does work well but it doesn't stay on my blow dryer all that well. So, it's a little awkward to use.
"
"
I was apprehensive about buying this, but it works great.  I read al of the reviews and learned from them.  I don't use high heat and I've had no problems after at least a month of use.  Works great and quickly in drying my wavy/curly hair.
"
"
Didn't fit my blow dryer well. Only fits perfectly if you purchase the DevaCurl blow dryer.
"
"
I do not like how it fits the dryer. I need to be able to adjust the angle of the diffuser without twisting my arm. I wish it fit like the regular diffuser that comes with the Deva hair dryer because you are able to turn the nozzle different ways. The universal diffuser has big rubber grips that make it difficult, and I think turning it while it's on the dryer will ruin it. Puls, it's hard to turn. I also wish more air came out of the ""palm"" of the diffuser.
"
"
I bought mine in April of 2015. After using this defuser on average 4 times a week, two of the nubs that stick out from the rubber band broke in half. The defuser is still usable, but it takes a lot more effort to get it on my blow dryer. There are some cracks above the rubber band that will eventually break then the defuser will be unusable. Since the defuser has become a part of my daily routine, I am repurchasing.
"
"
Fit on my ion hairdryer perfectly, I love this product it makes my hair look amazing!
"
"
I bought two of these- works great !
"
"
Shape made drying hair easier
"
"
Works great. Love the air flow is through the entire piece. Hair dries quicker.
"
"
Won't fit my hair dryer which is a tapered barrel. So you would think that it would attach to the barrel at some point, but it does not. I missed the return by date, so I am stuck with this sucker. I did like the product, but I had to hold onto my hairdryer, which was nearly impossible to do while diffusing my hair.  I'm giving it to stars because I think if you had the right kind a hair dryer, it would be a very good product.
"
"
It is very difficult first to find a hair blower that this fits, then it does not stay secure on the dryer ....very difficult to use.  Not happy with the limited use of this product.
"
"
This is not universal.  It will not stay on my standard hairdryer.  It keeps slipping off when the dryer is on.
"
"
With the right products and this DevaFuser my hair is now back to all its' curly gloryness. Been lazy the last few years and kind of just let the curls go their own way. Now I'm receiving compliments every day. Curly hair girls know to use a diffuser. This is an awesome one.
"
"
I had to return it. It did not fit my hair dryer.
"
"
I'm not sure if it even works for diffusing hair but I tell you what I'll have an extra hand when I need one~! Lol I Love this diffuser~! I'll repost after I actually use it on my hair~!
"
"
There really isn't anything bad I can say about this product. It is completely different than using a normal diffuser and takes some getting use to. With my traditional diffuser, it dries my hair from the tips to the scalp often leaving my hair flat. With  the DevaCurl, it dries it from the scalp to the tips and adds so much more volume. Getting the tips dry is a challenge, but not a deal breaker for me. There have been complaints about it melting, but I use it on my low heat setting (which still gives plenty of heat) and I have had no issues. I am very happy about this purchase and would recommend it to anyone with curly hair.
"
"
I can wrestle this on to my travel sizes Chi Dryer, but it pops off after 5 mins. I honestly don't understand why this is so much better than a regular diffuser. My hair didn't see that much of a difference between the two. I tossed the box before testing (like a genius) so no returns for me :(
"
"
GRRRRR!!!!!Like so many others, I bought this device, just KNOWING it was the answer to all my granddaughters prayers.  And like so many others I read the reviews, noting that almost all of the many many negative reviews talked about how the device didn't fit over their hair dryers.  But one person said that it didn't fit over her 2 1/2"" dryer mouth but did in fact fit over her 2"" wide dryer ""mouth"".  I measured my dryer and it was 2"" so I ordered this product.  Well guess what??? It doesn't even come CLOSE to fitting my 2"" wide opening!  Now I either have to send the thing back or go try to find a new hair dryer with a very small opening, which means I will have to stand in the store opening all of the different brands of dryers and measuring them with my tape measure.  It also means I will have to buy another hair dryer that I don't need since I already have 2 perfectly good ones.  What a crock!
"
"
Not any better than a regular diffuser. I was disappointed.
"
"
I was very excited to purchase this after my stylist used it on my hair. However, when I received it it did not fit my hair dryer. This seems to be common based on the other reviews. I bought a new hair dryer just so I could use this product. It still did not fit well, this time it kept slipping off the dryer. The diffuser has already cracked, although I have been as gentle with it as I can. I think I've sunk enough money into this product. Fair warning!
"
"
Way overrated and over priced.  Does not curl as well as our regular diffuser, and you cannot use high heat with it so it takes forever for your hair to dry.  A waste of money!
"
"
I expected my curls would look fabulous with this diffuser and they looked like they do with any other diffuser.  I couldn't even keep it on my main dryer, but it did fit on another one I had laying around.  Wasn't impressed.  Returned it.
"
"
This product was not for me.  Hard to find a dryer it fit (thankfully I have more than one) and tried it once, hated it!  Very bulky to use.
"
"
Didn't work like I thought it would. Wish I could give no stars. :((
"
"
difficult to find the right hair dryer that fits with it.
"
"
I just received the diffuser attachment yesterday. I love it! It fit my dryer. It is adjustable. I love how this can dry your roots without messing up my curl. It also gave me great volume at the root. I just started to use Devacurl products on my wavy hair and I'm hooked!
"
"
Well, it didn't fit on my dryer. I never even got a chance to use it. For whatever reason, the packing slip wasn't included in my purchase either. Hopefully, I'll be able to return it.
"
"
Unfortunately this diffuser did not fit my hairdryer properly. In addition it is very big, bulky & awkward. Not very easy to use on fine, long hair.
"
"
I ordered this over a year ago,  but have only used it maybe 20 times.  It started cracking in the first month.  This morning,  it completely broke. Good for the few times I used it, but not worth the price. I won't be buying again.
"
"
I was really excited to find out Deva came out with a new DevaFuser. I had the original one which was poorly designed and after having two that broke in only a short period of time broke down and purchased the DevaDryer. Pretty disappointed in the Dryer. I've had it a little over a year and it already has stopped working, for the price it is rather poor quality. I recently got a new hair dryer and purchased this attachment, however it doesn't fit. I have tried it on several and none of them are small enough to accommodate this attachment. Another poor design. Very disappointed because this is the only thing like it on the market and is really great, if it only fit.
"
"
amazing!
"
"
Worked fantastic!  It get my roots dry which is the biggest problem with curly hair.  I will never use another diffuser
"
"
Awesome
"
"
I have been waiting over a year for this fuser to come out!!  I like it a lot.  i seem to have less frizz with it.  I would of given it 5 stars if it would of come with directions on how to use it.  I am getting better at it.  If you have curly hair I think you will like this and I do think it will fit on every hairdryer.  Also I have medium short hair.
"
"
Boo.... It absolutely did not fit my dryer, no matter how I tried adjusting the elastic band (Revlon 1875W,  model RVDR5175). Frustrating, I had high hopes for it. I found a much cheaper and FAR superior solution in the ""Hot Stock."" Try that before you spend 10x as much on this plastic hand.
"
"
I have 2 different hair dryers and it fits neither one. It's also HUGE. Not at all what I expected. I can't say if it works well, couldn't try it, but I certainly was not going to spend nearly $200 on the dryer they say goes with it; although supposedly it fits ""most standard"" hairdryers.
"
"
I have owned this product just over a month, used it a handful of times and it melted at the wrist.
"
"
If you have curly hair, you have to use DevaCurl products.
"
"
This diffuser is bigger than I expected but fits on my T3 hair drier. It's hand shaped design makes it work perfectly with my curls. I am able to get my curls dry without disturbing my curl pattern. It's a real time saver. It also help with building volume without doing damage.

the salon i go to uses this on my hair and i love it! so i was excited when they started selling just the diffuser, it fits my blow dryer perfect i have an old revlon drying i have had for about 5 years now, very east to put on, the only negative thing i have to say about it is , if you have never used it before it does take some getting used to, so i do reccomend watching youtube videos and things like that, also i will recomment getting the Deva styling prodects as well.

My hair has never looked better, I have fine curly hair, but you would never know it is fine after using this attachment!  I do not know why I did not buy this sooner.  I am using it on my cheap normal hairdryer, I see no reason to buy the Deva dryer.Try it, you will love it!!
"
"
I love it.  My hair dries beautifully with this
"
"
As promised
"
"
Doesn't fit on any hairdryer. Waste of Money!!!
"
"
Unfortunately, it didn't fit my dryer - but, that's my fault as I didn't bother to measure it before I bought it.
"
"
LOVE IT!!
"
"
Wife loves it so far. Says it saves her so much time. Just one thing. Her blow dryer had a short snout or whatever it's called. So we had to get one with a longer one so it can stay on right.
"
"
It's great
"
"
doesn't fit any dryer i own  Poor instructions
"
"
It's just okay.
"
"
I was unsure of the fit onto my own dryer! Fit "" like a glove"" ,,very easy to apply to dryer! The airflow is great for my first braidout!! Love this!
"
"
Works great!!  Adds volume to thin curly hair and dries faster than other diffusers.
"
"
I always thought my normal diffuser did a good job but I didn't know what potential my curls had! This amazing thing gave me corkscrew curls all over. I did use the devacurl cream along with it and I never ever had hair like this before and I go to a salon for my hair care. Every girl with curls must have this. I never even knew it existed until last week...where has this been all my life?! Why it isn't sold in every target store is beyond me😊
"
"
Works. Definitely speeds the drying process. I bought this attachment for my Revlon RV484 blow dryer. I did measure before I purchased and it was still a tight fit.
"
"
Not a tool for gals with chin length or shorter hair - have tried really hard to make it work for me and it gets a big, fat fail. Too big, too bulky, too difficult to maneuver. Wish I could return it :(
"
"
Love this diffuser and highly recommend for any one with curls!
"
"
it's ok - i find it makes my hair frizzy.  i'd rather air dry!
"
"
Its falling apart and has not even been six months since the purchase.
"
"
This is not a universal attachment and does not fit all dryers, the only way i got it to fit my dryer, which is not a big one, was to remove the rubber band, then it slides off the dryer.  Disappointed
"
"
Like many other reviewers, I had to find a hair dryer with a very narrow nozzle to get this to work. I think I could have gotten this diffusor over my original hair dryer but I was leery of how much that stretched the rubber band. Bed Bath to the rescue! The Conair InfinitiPro Salon Performance Hair Dryer worked perfectly.This diffusor is magic. I tend to shower at night, so being able to dry my hair before bed is idea and this diffusor does a better job than any other fast drying method. Love, love, love this diffusor!The only downside is that I keep the diffusor on the hair dryer, which makes storing it a bit tricky.
"
"
This is the best blow dryer, regardless of whether you have curly or straight hair! The holes on either side of the ""claw"" as I call it, allow for airflow on both sides, and much faster drying! Do yourself a favor and buy this to speed up your getting ready time in the mornings!
"
"
Not that thrilled with this diffuser.  I measured my blowers before buying but wouldn't fit either and required purchasing a new dryer. When I was able to use the diffuser it just seemed more like a gimmick than actually helpful to me.  By the time this is attached to the dryer it is pretty bulky to handle.  I have gone back to just letting my hair dry naturally. I suppose if I am in a hurry I will use it but as it must be used on low heat it takes a long time to dry my hair and I don't have thick hair.
"
"
I'm glad I waited until this was redesigned to fit on any drier.  When I first opened the box and saw how tiny the opening was I thought for sure I'd have to buy a new dryer, but it really does stretch to fit!  I used it for the first time this morning and I loved it.  I hate going out with wet hair in the winter and now I can dry the hair at my roots before heading out the door.  This gave my hair nice lift off my scalp and the rest of the curls are able to dry quickly with ambient air and they look well-defined.  I don't know about the reviews about the plastic melting, My hair is medium-thick and I used the highest heat setting and had no trouble. I did not dry my hair completely because I prefer the look when it air-dries.  But I was able to dry the roots and that's what I wanted.
"
"
Did not fit dryer.
"
"
I do love this diffuser. It did a nice job with my curls and fit on my existing hairdryer perfectly. But I prefer the traditional shape of professional diffusers.
"
"
If your hair dryer has a ""fat"" opening, you will struggle to get this on.  I finally got it on, but then one of the screws on the side came undone due to the pressure of how far it had to stretch.
"
"
Buyers beware. Product seems official and works wonderfully. Amazon is NOT however, an authorized retailer of DevaCurl products. The elastic band that holds the attachment firm to you dryer MAY pop while in use. There is no replacement band and DevaCurl will NOT be able to help you.
"
"
Dries hair nicely without breaking the curl just wish I didn't have to keep checking if it's sliding off my blower.
"
"
didn't fit on my dryer had to get a new one
"
"
I was hesitant to purchase this defuser after ready some of the reviews I found online but finally bit the bullet. After using it once I was hooked.  I have tried many defusers over the years but none were even close to thing one. I only wish I knew about it years ago. I also started using the DevaCare hair products which are a little pricey but worth ever penny. My curls looks better than they ever have. I have only used my on the medium setting with low heat and it work great.
"
"
I have curly hair. This adds volume to the top of my hair which is great. but it does make it frizzy. I have been using 2 different diffuses. I could have done without this product.
"
"
Didn't fit my blow dryer and the return label provided does not open. The seller does not respond to my question to get a valid return label.  NO RESPONSE. Now I have to dispute charges.  It's a pain.  I don't recommend it.
"
"
a very good product! I am surprised no one has thought of it before!  :)
"
"
I have tried it multiple times just as directed. It created massive frizz and took far too long. A waste of money. I am back to ploping overnight.
"
"
Best defuser I have used in my one year natural hair journey.  Dried my hair without disturbing the curls created with the Deva microfiber towel.  I did have to remove the band for it to fit my Conair dryer but it does not slip off at all.  This was a great purchase!
"
"
Product is good but not sure it is the diffuser for me
"
"
Helps with curly hair, as it gently dries hair with out hair becoming frizzy! I do use product in order for my curls to have definition.
"
"
I used with a non Devachan blower and it killed my blower.
"
"
This Product Does Not Fit On Any Of My Blow Dryers && I Have 3. It Pops Off Every Time I Let Go. The elastic Band Does Not Stretch Enough && Does Not Hold The Diffuser In Place On The Dryer. Horrible !! Do Not Waste You Time Or Money
"
"
I go to the Devachan salon regularly to get my hair cut & styled so I'm familiar with this tool, and I know how to use it. Regardless, very disappointed. It's just not made for home use, and Deva is exploiting Curly Girls by selling it. It's next to impossible to find a home dryer it will fit onto, and when I finally did, the diffuser split along one of the side seams anyway. So upsetting. Not that it worked all that well before it split because it didn't. It frizzed my curls and clumped them weirdly. And yes, I used the cool setting and as I said I know how to use it; I've been shown how by the stylists in Deva's salon.Honestly, not worth the overpriced $ they charge, a regular diffuser works better.
"
"
good, as described
"
"
Love it
"
"
I LOVE this diffuser. I wouldn't recommend leaving it in one spot for a long time. It's best to hold it no more than 5 seconds and keep doing this all over your head. My curls looked FAAAAAAAAAANTASTIC.
"
"
So here is a link to a dryer that this devafuser will fit on.  I wish someone would have just listed this for me. http://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Rvdr5029-Smoothstay-Ceramic-Purple/dp/B003ICXCG6?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00
"
"
It's okay
"
"
It fit my dryer chi low emf brilliant. It just pops off sometime. Big hand, but doesn't dry fast.
"
"
Easy, Breezy, Beautiful. Thank you!
"
"
Extremely effective. This gets 4 starts rather than 5 simply because it's not an easy travel piece. It's not like hotels come stocked with amazing defusers!
"
"
Best defuser ever made!!!! If you have curly hair this is a must have!
"
"
Barely fit my t3 but works great. Helps dry the hair closest to scalp. Gives good lift to your roots.
"
"
My curls wasn't frizzy and my hair dried in record time. Loving my natural hair and curls. The product works y'all!
"
"
Bought this relying on advertising claim that is is a ""universal"" attachment that fits ""most"" hairdryers.  Watch out!!  I have three hair dryers at home.  Fits none of them.  I took this one three business trips.  Fits none of the hotel hair dryers.  And I went to several drugstores and beauty supply stores in search of a small barrel hairdryer that this might work with.  No luck there either.  Meanwhile, the return window has closed and I am now stuck with this completely useless piece of green plastic.  Shouldn't have purchased it.  Should have returned it right away instead of searching for a hairdryer to work with it.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE WASTE THEIR TIME WITH THIS PRODUCT.
"
"
This is a handy defuser. I don't want to be without it
"
"
Totally love it!!for curl freaks like me this device makes all the difference !!!
"
"
I guess I always thought that I just had ""bad"" curls - not the nice, smoothe looking curls/waves I always wanted and then came the DevaFuser.  In all seriousness, I cannot believe the difference in my hair after drying with this device.  It's really exciting for me because being able to wear my hair curly (and not blow it out) saves me so much time and with 22 month old twin boys time is at a premium these days.  I can honestly say that I love my curls when using the DevaFuser to dry them (even more so than air drying).  I've also found that the DevaCurl products make a huge difference too.  As you can tell, I'm definitely a believer.  Highly recommend!Note:  I read other reviewers saying the device didn't fit their hairdryers which definitely may be true of certain models but I, too, thought this didn't fit mine until I realized that I had to push it all the way onto the barrel - it doesn't sit at the end like other diffusers.
"
"
I love it! My curly locks appreciate this difusor very much.
"
"
Definitely helps give definition to my hair! The shipping arrived super fast!
"
"
Very useful for curly hair. Attachment works on all hairdryers.
"
"
excellent for my curly hair but it fit an old hair dryer that I had also it cracked the first time i used it but is still works BEWARE it doesnt fit all dryers
"
"
So, I haven't used this yet since it doesn't fit either one of my dryers, but my first thought is that, it looks cheap and the plastic looks like it will break easily. Can't believe this was $30.00. Now i have to either send it back,(which I hate), or I have to go on a hunt for a dryer that it will fit and spend more money. I was so excited to get this because i love the concept. Not happy.UPDATE;  so I gave this a bad review because it didn't fit my hairdryer and was mad because i'd have to buy another one. I came close to purchasing one but stopped. Glad i did because i spotted my brush wand dryer that iv'e had forever but never use. Turns out I could remove the brush part by unscrewing the nob at the top leaving just the wand. the diffuser slipped right over it and was able to push it into the hand part. PERFECT! Now I love it. I was even able to position the power button between the tongs. If you don't have one, they're pretty cheep. and it was actually more comfortable to hold it that way for drying versus with a gun style. My hair dried with out blowing it around and got great volume.
"
"
I discover Deva products for curly hair a few years ago and cannot live without them.  I've had my eye on the original dryer and diffuser but just did not see myself spending that much for a hair dryer.  Now that its available on its own, I really wanted to try it.  I was also in need of a universal diffuser so I could take with me on travel.First, I was pleased that it fit my hair drying which has a snap on diffuser that is not universal.  Once I turned on the dryer, I was worried there wasn't enough air flow coming out of the attachment, I could barely feel it.  I thought it would take forever for my hair to dry.  (I have shoulder length, deva cut, type 3A curls.)  Was I wrong!  There is a slight learning curve especially trying to figure out how to hold the dryer and position the hand in your hair.  It took about the same amount of time as with a standard diffuser BUT my curls were less frizzy, more defined, and had amazing volume!  I do believe that once I get past the learning curve, my dry time will be faster with this diffuser.  I'm never going to give this up.  Thanks Amazon!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Very disappointed. Cheaply made. Slips off hairdryer while in use. Frustrating.
"
"
First of all, when I received the Devafuser, it did not fit my blow-drier :(  But I really love all the other DevaCurl products I use regularly: (One Condition, no-poo shampoo,  light defining gel, styling cream, and frizz-free volumizing foam). So I did my research online and measured the nozzle of the diffuser attachment and determined that the nozzle of the blow drier had to be about 1.5"" measured across the nozzle for attachment to fit. So I took my measuring tape with me to Walmart, Target, and then Sally Beauty supply. BINGO at Sally Beauty supply! This is what I got and fits perfectly: Plugged in Ceramic Tourmaline Stow'n Go mini dryer, which cost $19.99. Devafuser slid right on the dryer and stayed put. Took about 15 minutes to dry my shoulder length fine 3B (spirals) hair. I got lift at the roots that was needed and my hair is so soft.
"
"
Did not fit my hair dryer or anyone else's hair dryer in my household. Waste of my money
"
"
Profotmance of the product wasn't quite what I expected.
"
"
My wife loves this defuser and uses it all the time
"
"
I really wanted this product, and overall I love how it made my hair look. I had to give it 1 star, however because it's really not a universal diffuser. It seemed to fit my Remington Hair Dryer fine, but after using it the first time, it warped and melted. I saw a review before purchasing the diffuser that cautioned against it. However the person said their hair dryer was made of aluminum and since mine is made of plastic I thought it would be ok. I was using it on low power and high heat because there was nothing in the instructions that cautioned against using it on high heat. I'm very disappointed. I'd like to purchase another one of these, if I could find a dryer that was compatible with it. I e-mailed DevaCurl asking if they have a list of compatible dryers.
"
"
Wife says it doesn't work. Should return it.
"
"
Really loved this diffuser until it melted.
"
"
Why anyone would buy prestige brands off Amazon is beyond me, especially with the bootlegs people produce. You never know what you're truly getting! I bought this from Ulta, an actual devacurl seller, and have had no problems with it melting. On top of that, you're supposed to leave some ventilation at the barrel for the air to get out, not just through the hand, and it's meant to be used with low or medium heat. I had to buy a new dryer to fit this diffuser, not that I minded since my dryer was pretty old anyway.Revlon 1875W Quick Dry Lightweight Hair Dryer https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A3I2X4/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_AoUQAbVGFP5DCIt'll fit with a bit of force, you do have to push down hard and move the band up a bit. I don't intend on leaving my diffuser on it all the time. The band does contract once you pull it off, it doesn't stay stretched out to the dryer you just put it on.
"
"
I did not buy from amazon so this is not about the seller.  I bought from large chain beauty store instead.  The design is neat, and does cradle curls and can be inserted up ""into"" the curls while they hang naturally (instead of flipping over head with other diffusers).  But it is very difficult to get onto standard hair dryers.  I have a T3 and a generic Revlon and an Italian Turbo hairdryer and all of them have to have man-hand strength to force it onto the ends.  It also then slides off easily during storage.  And has to be put back on again by the husband who is sick of it.  I can't do it myself; the rubber band won't stretch enough for me to fit a standard size dryer.  It also takes the hair forever to dry.  When I saw the diffuser my stylist used, which wasn't this one, I realized it wasn't doing squat for my curls or my daughters and we have completely different curls.  For the price especially, thumbs down.
"

I'm a regular user of products in the Deva Curl line, so I was very excited to receive this as a birthday gift from my bf. I'd read all the rave reviews and seen videos of how it works for curly hair. I've used it twice and unfortunately, it did not perform as well as I thought it would.As a naturally-curly-haired girl, one of the things I've always been told is to not brush, comb, or run your fingers through your curls b/c all it does is break your curl pattern, make flyaways, and increase frizz. Because you slide the diffuser under your hair in order to dry the roots, it does exactly that: I had more flyaways and frizz than I had with my cheaper, old-school diffuser. It relaxed more of my curls instead of keeping the curl definition & pattern and even made some straight pieces. Because of all the holes in the design, esp around the outside of the fingers, blowing AIR - not just HEAT - comes out from all directions, which creates the flyaways & added frizz. I suppose it made my hair dry faster with all the extra air and heat, but honestly, I was too disappointed in how my hair was drying & looking to even notice. To dry curly hair, you want ONLY heat, not blowing air, in order to maintain your curl definition and bounce, so for me, this product was a surprising disappointment. Sadly, I will be returning it and buying another cheap, old-school diffuser that will give me the results that I want even if it takes a little more time.TIP: For those of you who said the diffuser did not fit your dryer, take measurements of your dryer BEFORE you purchase. The Deva Curl website has measurements & details listed. I took my measurements ahead of time, and while my dryer's circumference was at the max, it still fit. It did take some effort to get the diffuser onto the dryer and the band on the diffuser is tight and strong, but it will expand to fit your dryer if the measurements are correct.
"
"
Surprised and disappointed. It was fine reaching the roots (not great), but it does not scrunch my hair well. Since it is a smooth surface hair slides right off and does not aid in hair definition. I have 2C/3A hair that looses curl easy if not handled properly and this actually smoothed it out more than curl.
"
"
Works great!!! I have a diffuser that came with my hairdryer that I liked enough... but this diffuser is WOW.BUTDO NOT USE IN HOT!!!Set your dryer to cool! If you have curly hair, you don't need to blow dry your hair with hot air if you want to wear your hair curly and as frizz-free as possible. Keeping your dryer on cool will help keep the frizz down, and keep your curls intact. Diffusers aren't meant to be used with hot heat! So if yours has melted... stop using hot heat, and start using cool air! It will make a HUGE difference!
"
"
Okay, so I am writing this to  help anyone who is debating getting this. I saw all of the reviews saying the diffuser wouldn't fit on their very basic dryer and here is why: the product does fit, it just takes some finagling. Honestly if it appears it doesn't fit at first this could be a good thing because it means it won't fall off! What you have to do is ""wiggle"" it on!!! Rock it for lack of better explanation. So if you buy this, don't return it unless you've tried this method. DC really needs to address this as people are frequently upset about this!! Hope this helps!
"
"
Wish I had read all the reviews about the diffuser not fitting most dryers. Didn't fit mine and when I took it to a store that had about 10 to choose from, it didn't fit ANY!  Not sure if those who had dryers that fit the diffuser were older models or what, but I think DevaCurl should address this issue by either modifying their design or telling people it won't fit most of the dryers on the market.  It would also be nice if read the numerous reviews (over 50%) where the diffuser didn't fit (or maybe they do and don't care).
"
"
This past fall my duagher mentioned wanting a diffuser to properly take care of her very long wavy hair..i did a bit of research..all of the girls with curls seemed to vote for this one...after the fact I believe that i've made the right choice.  She was really happy with it and several of her friends said this 'was the best'
"
"
There's been a lot of hype when it comes to this defuser and that's not because it's poorly made. DevaCurl isn't known for doing shotty work then overpricing it. this is a good product for most curls, as long as it's being used correctly. This product melts because it can't stand heat just like your curls can't stand the heat. it's not made for high temperatures because you're not supposed to be exposing your hair to heat. my friend's had hers for years and it still works perfectly, so I decided to get one and I can't be happier with it.
"
"
I bought this for my short (not quite jaw length) curly hair and it's *okay*... BUT it works WONDERS on my daughter's almost waist length, super heavy, super thick, wavy hair.  We can put the ""hand"" up into her hair and get it dry all the way through.  I have to really push to get it on my dryer and the join or connection separates on one side, but otherwise we like it!
"
"
I REALLY wanted to like this. However, it did not fit any of my dryers. None. Had to return.
"
"
I have been embracing my hair's natural wave pattern (2b) more and more following the Curly Girl method but find that it's not always feasible to leave the house with wet hair, especially in the winter months. I have a standard bowl diffuser that came with my blow dryer (a Chi Pro) but for some reason it does not stay securely attached to the blow dryer's nozzle. This, coupled with the bowl diffuser's awkwardness when trying to dry certain areas of my hair, proved frustrating.  Enter the DevaFuser. What I love about this diffuser is that you can approach your entire head from various angles and the air blows from both sides of the diffuser in addition to airflow coming from each side of the ""fingers"". The fingers also enable you to target specific areas that a bowl diffuser might not be able to get to, like the back of your head, without breaking up the curl/wave clumps. There are plenty of wonderful videos on YouTube that demonstrate different ways to use the DevaFuser.The DevaFuser fits both my Chi Pro and my mom's antiquated Revlon dryer which have different sized nozzles. I did notice some separation at the attachment site when I put it on my Chi (hard to describe without a picture), but the thick rubber band seems to hold this diffuser in place fine. I have not had any issues with the plastic melting like other reviewers have stated, but I definitely recommend using the low setting on your dryer when using this attachment. I find that my hair is actually wavier/borderline curly when I take the time to diffuse it using the DevaFuser, probably because it gently dries wet hair, forming and establishing the curl pattern, unlike with air drying in which the weight of the water in the hair can weigh it down and elongate or pull out the curl pattern. I should also mention that I recently cut my hair to shoulder length. Very long hair will probably not completely ""fit"" into this diffuser the way that it might with a bowl diffuser, so that might be something to consider when purchasing this item.Overall, I am extremely happy with this item and it has definitely improved my daily hair routine and appearance!
"
"
Dries hair quickly.  Had a little difficulty finding a blow dryer it would fit.  Does keep the curl in - but plumps my hair up too much.  I need to keep toying with it, maybe just letting it blow over my hair, rather than going up from underneath.
"
"
Love this diffuser! Dries from the roots perfectly, giving me lift without clips.  Took 10 minutes off my drying time and didn't frizz out my curls!
"
"
Sorry but this thing is horrible for my type of curl. Had a lot of messy flat looking curls. Only thing this is good for is giving lift to my roots. I will stick to the standard diffuser.
"
"
Terrible fit - it’s supposed to attach to the blow dryer with this elaborate rubber band thing that can’t possibly be durable!! It’s going back to the store!! Sigh
"
"
I bought this to go with my hair dryer (with a barrel within dimensions shown by mfr), and it doesn't fit. In fact, it doesn't fit on 3 of my dryers. :(
"
"
The devafuser did not fit on our hair dryer nor our daughters. It did not fit on any hair dryer sold at target. Had to go to a hair salon supply store to find a hair dryer that it would fit on. That said, my wife really likes the defuser.
"
"
I would like to try this, but has anyone used it on cool or warm setting and still have it melt?
"
"
Works well and delivered on time.
"
"
Considering the price, I feel it should adapt to any hair dryer. It seems to want to slip off because ofdesign.
"
"
I do not usually write reviews. I didn't see that many great reviews about this tool but took a risk at my local beauty store and bought it. Partially because they offered a Free gift with purchase.The cons:It was difficult to get onto my blow dryer. I have a Revlon something or other that I bought on amazon a few years ago, it works great. But getting the defuser on the blow dryer was a struggle. I may even purchase another blow dryer for doing blow outs with a round brush because I don't want to ever have to put the attachment back on my blow dryer.The Pros:I have very thick and curly hair. I hated leaving the house with hair that was still wet near the roots or in the back. I hated drying that part of my hair because the direct heat would burn my head, ouch!I use my blow dryer on high with a low heat setting, my hair is dry in about 10 minutes. Not only is it dry but my curls are soft and manageable. Game changer. I feel like my hair drys evenly and I don't have to worry about that awkward spot that is still wet.As someone who is blessed with curly hair, you can't afford to not have this gadget. I've googled, youtube'd, and the like every hair product, oh wet to dry straighter, really? broken in one use.This product actually works and does wonders.
"
"
My curly hair never looked so good!
"
"
I love the design of this diffuser. It definitely allows you to get air flow into your curls without distorting the shape of the curls. The problem is that material the dryer is composed of cannot withstand even the low heat of a dryer. Mine melted into a gnarled claw shape that is completely useless. Anyone with thick curly hair knows that it takes quite a while to dry your curls. Even in the DevaCurl videos, they suggest holding the dryer in each position for 2 minutes. Well, do that and you will be lucky to not be cutting melted plastic out of your hair. Using the ""cool"" setting is simply impractical -- my hair would take hours to dry on ""cool,"" and it's not even beyond shoulder length! For this price, they should have chosen more durable material.  I've never seen anything like it in 30 years of using diffusers on my hair!
"
"
I was so anxious to receive this ""hand"" as I call it.  Curly hair is difficult to style and make it look like it wasn't just air-dryed.  This attachment fits perfectly on my Infiniti Pro by Conair 1875 watt.  This hair dryer was much cheaper than the one shown with the attachment and had great reviews.  Anyway, this ""hand"" dries my hair at the root and doesn't dry out the ends which can look frizzy.  I highly recommend for those curly haired folks who like an uplifting curly style.
"
"
Fits like a glove on my jinri ionic infrared hair dryer! I wanted this after I got a deva cut and my stylist used it. Liked the results :)I give it only 3 stars because ....1. This is a cheaply made item (despite the great design) so I would NOT recommend this product to someone that likes to dry their hair on the high settings. I can definitely see this thing melting if it gets to hot. Maybe even breaking if you dropped it on a hard floor. I use this on low air and low to medium heat with no issues...however it does seem delicate to me.2. the drying time is slower than with a normal diffuser for my wavy curly hair. USEFUL TIP: The most airflow comes out of the finger tips. It took me a few goes to realize that but it's important to know. This helps in reducing your drying time and increasing volume.
"
"
This is 100% the best diffuser I've ever used. I'm not sure if I'm just not good at being a ""Curly Girl"" but I've had some serious issues with diffusers in the past. I always feel awkward using them and they can feel way too big and clunky. Don't get me wrong, this thing felt awkward too at first (come on, it's a hand) but now I love it and almost never go a day without it.Getting it on my hair dryer was a pain in the butt, so I caved and got my boyfriend to man-handle it on. You just have to put the nose of your hair dryer in and try to work the rubber band down so it holds everything together. I do NOT recommend using this diffuser on a high heat setting as it does get hot very quickly and some of the past reviews even said it can melt. I never had an issue getting my hair to dry quickly on the low setting and honestly I think high heat settings are never good for your hair (especially curly hair!). I recently also switched to the Deva Curl Supercream Coconut Curl Styler Cream, which I LOVE, and I put it on my hair before I diffuse it.Photo attached if you are interested in how my hair turned out using both products mentioned.

Honestly, I suspected this was a hokey and too-expensive product, but as many people with curly hair will attest, we'll try anything if it has half a chance of taming our curls.  I've been dealing with my curls for over 50 years and have had a love-hate relationship with diffusers.  Well, one use of the DevaCurl Devafuser and I was hooked. This diffuser delivered a quick blow-dry that minimized frizz and still maximized volume.  One of my biggest challenges was always drying my roots:  blow dry too much and the ends of my hair dried out and split; blow dry too little and damp roots would over the course of a couple of hours weigh down my hair and rob it of any volume on top while the rest of my hair stayed big, bold, and out there.  Half the time I'd be rockin' a Bozo The Clown look by lunchtime.  (And no, it wasn't the haircut.  I'd have had to go to a mullet to get my hair to keep any volume before.  And that was ... just not going to happen.)  Back to this diffuser ... well, it fixed all that:  now the volume stays and I don't need as much product.  I've been using it for over two years now; it's still in perfect working shape and my curls have stayed healthy.  And no more Bozo!  :)

I was so excited to use my new deva diffuser, I tried it the say it arrived. During my first try with my blow dryer the band broke while attached to my blow dryer. I guess the band needs to be stronger. I really like the design, so I added one of my hair bands to replace the broken band.  Maybe I should try to return for replacement. $40 is a lot to pay for somethimg to break one the fiest use.
"
"
I bought this diffuser for my naturally curly hair but was never comfortable using it and ended up switching back to a more traditional style round diffuser.  When I talked to my DevaCurl specialists, she told me this style of diffuser is intended for someone with thicker, curlier hair than mine.  My hair is 2c/3A curls but fine, so this diffuser was not the right one for me.
"
"
VERY dissatisfied and dissappointed in this product! If I could return it, I would! I checked the measurements several times before purchasing and it should have fit according to the description. It doesn't fit either of my blow-dryers, or my friends, or my mother's! Didn't bother to even turn on the blow-dryer with it since I couldn't even get it on a blowdryer. I ever took off the band to try it that way! Tried selling on Facebook and no one would purchase even at half price. Do NOT buy!!!
"
"
This did nothing to make my hair curly nor manageable.  I have wavy/curly fine hair... this made it look like I walked off the set of the Walking Dead.  Horrible device.  The company was kind enough to refund me.  The product DID arrive on time, packaged well and I didn't think it would fit on my blowdryer but if you initially sit down & put the blowdryer between your knee and PUSH this diffuser on - it does fit.  I have a few blowdryers and the fit was better with some than wider ones
"
"
This did not fit on my T3 Featherweight hair dryer. Very disappointed.
"
"
I had a problem finding a hair dryer that would fit the DevaCurl, but I FOUND ONE!  right here on Amazon.  Chic Belle Professional Hair Dryer 1875W Ionic Black with Diffuser fits the DevaCurl perfectly!  And reasonable priced.  Have funChic Belle Professional Hair Dryer 1875W Ionic Black with Diffuser with it!
"
"
I call this my chicken foot diffuser. It works great for my wavy hair. It has saved me from having to straighten my hair every day. I highly recommend it to anyone who just can’t air dry their hair without looking like a crack head. (My problem was real!) This allows me to dry my hair in waves with no frizz and I don’t have to put a bunch of hoop in my hair. I use the Deva towel and the wavy hair deva products. Life changing! Okay, maybe not life changing but I’m not spending 45 minutes on my hair anymore and that’s a big deal to me.
"
"
Regular cup diffusers mess up my wave pattern and make my hair look 'crinckled'.  The Devafuser dries my hair without disturbing the wave pattern.
"
"
The attachment does not fit on my hair dryer snugly even though it says it fits most hair dryers. (i have tried 2 different hair dryers) The air also escapes a lot at the spaces that are at the bottom of the attachment so not much air is outputted from the attachment itself. My hair is constantly being tangled at the opening since it expands and leaves large gaps for my hair to be hooked on. I regret buying the attachment. Thought i would save some money from purchasing just the attachment but now I don't even use it and have to use my cheaper diffuser which gives me good results with less trouble. Wished this worked good so that I can get the devacul results.
"
"
Dries well, gives great volume at the roots. Usually makes my waves look nice, but it can make make my hair frizzy in days when the humidity is low (but so can all diffusers). My daughter has straighter hair, and she even like it because it dries her roots so fast.I have a super solano and it fits really well over the narrow, straight barrel.
"
"
I'm sure this is a good product. But problem is it does not fit on my blow dryer. I've tried three and the end is to big. They blow dryer for this attachment is over $100 dollars. I'm not going to do that. So make sure to find a blow dryer that works.
"
"
I love this product!  I have long thick wavy/curly hair.  This diffuser is so easy to use and dries my heavy hair quickly and evenly.  Be sure to use it on low heat.  There is no static - doesn't blow my hair all over the place and the curls stay.  I also use DevaCurl products as well.  I'm happy with all of them.
"
"
I love how the base of this is fairly flexible but still snug enough to stay put on my dryer nozzle. So I can see this as being much more universal than other alleged ""universal"" diffusers out there. Fits my babyliss pro nano titanium hair dyer very well. It should be noted that this will probably only fit circular shaped nozzles.
"
"
After debating whether or not I should buy this diffuser, I decided to purchase after finding a video on how to make this fit for larger hairdryers. My hairdryer's barrel is very fat (almost 2 inches in diameter) and it fit with minimal/gentle pressure. As far as performance, the DevaFuser did not dry my hair as quickly as standard diffusers, but I have significantly less frizz and my curls (3A/3B curls) are bouncier. It gave me great definition and great volume. The end result is well-worth the extra 15 minutes of drying time.
"
"
Love this diffuser. Easier to use than I thought. It doesn’t fit blow dryers well with a wide nozzle, so I had to get a flow dryer with a thin nozzle. It does get hot so I switched to low heat, medium speed and seemed to work. Left my hair with a lot of volume and very little frizz.
"
"
I think the universal attachment is just too inconvenient for my hair dryer. It slides up constantly and it didn't feel like I was getting much air to my head. However I think the deva dryer with the diffuser that fits would be great.
"
"
I loved this, but after only 3 months of use, the arms started breaking off. It is way too expensive for that to happen. Therefore, though the product works great for us curly headed people, it is not sturdy. Unless you plan to buy a new one several times a year, I would stay away from this diffuser. By the way, it is huge.....
"
"
Looks like a great product, but unfortunately, unlike it says in the description, it simply does not fit any hairdryer.I have 3 from brand new to a couple of years old.Probably it fits its own, but that isn't the point.You have the option to buy their hairdryer and that might work.
"
"
For this price, I expected it to work better at creating waves.  What I did like about it was that it gets very hot, so shortens drying time.  It is a MAJOR pain to put on your dryer (and I tried it on multiple).  Glad I tried it, but I sent it back as not worth the price.
"
"
Love thiS! It snaps on easily to my CHI blow dryer and works amazing! This, paired up with my deva curl hair products really make my hair amazing in ways I didn’t even know possible! Amazing diffuser! Game changer for anyone with curls
"
"
Way overpriced! Cheap! Great idea but poor execution. It’s held together by a plastic band that wares and distorts from the heat of the blow dryer.It distributes the air ok but for $30-50 dollars will never purchase another. Come on Deva you can do better for the cost.
"
"
I was very excited to use this diffuser when I got it. Got very disappointed when realized that it could not fit any of my dryers. Kept it for over a month to try it on many other dryers at different stores. Didn’t work! Now it’s too late to return it and I’m stuck with an expensive attachement that I can’t use. I wish I could give negative stars...
"
"
I love this!! It gives volume to my wavy hair as promised, and curls, if using the right products ;-)I don't leave reviews unless a great or terrible product. This is the former!
"
"
Didn't like it. Threw it out and went back to my old diffuser.
"
"
Broke with in a month. Extremely hard to get on my dryer and yes, I measured and it should have fit. The elastic band to hold it on broke today. Very disappointing.
"
"
Love love love this curl defuser!!!  It makes my medium type, short curls look so good!  I hey compliments al of the time on my hair and I know it's thanks to this ""grinch hand""!
"
"
I loved the concept and design of this, and it really helped add volume and definition to my shoulder-length curls. However, the material it's made from should not be used in a diffuser! It does melt, and I can no longer use mine without it falling off due to the misshapen inside. I really wish they'd listen to all of the reviews that complain of this problem and change the material they make this with to something that can withstand heat...I have 20+-year-old diffusers that are in perfect condition, so I know it's possible!!
"
"
The only thing I would caution it this diffuser doesn't fit just any hair dryer. It only fits driers with a smaller circumference. I ended up being able to use it on my travel dryer just fine. One can purchase the optional DevaCurl drier.
"
"
Fits Revlon Ceramic Tourmaline model RVDR5131. I use the diffuser on the warm setting without any problems. The end of my dryer barrel hardly gets warm so no issue with melting the diffuser attachment. My curls are full and soft! I won’t use another diffuser!
"
"
I liked that it covered a bigger area on my head as opposed to other diffusers. I really like it!
"
"
We were not able to use product because it would not fit on any hair dryers we had and we even purchased a new one with smaller end, but it still would not work.  We were able to return easily for a full refund, which is why we are giving it 3 stars.  We would try again if we could get it to fit on a standard hair dryer.
"
"
I honestly don’t have anything to say. This was for my daughter who knew exactly what she wanted. Must be good as I never a word. Lol
"
"
Opening on product does not match what ad states. Useless.
"
"
Designed to fit different hair dryers this attachment drys the bottom layer of the hair without causing it to poof out. An excellnt design because the bottom layer of hair is always the hardest to dry.
"
"
Works well, hold hair in place when drying, even gives a bit of a lift.  To me this company is the best!!!  Shampoos, conditioners, gels, etc...Hair towel is awesome..
"
"
Within minutes, my rubber band snapped off and immediately was broken. I tried to put a regular rubber band on to hold it in place but that didn't work either. I was under the impression this would fit any blow dryer, but that was not the case.
"
"
Love the way this product works but I have to say I am very concerned that it won't last. It has already split up the side and I have only had it a week. It does an amazing job at keeping my curls not frizzy and it drys my hair really fast but the durability is in question.
"
"
So easy to use and adds lots of volume to my long curly hair
"
"
Was hesitant to spend so much, but this diffuser really works. Worth it!
"
"
I really like this.  It fits my blow drier and seems like it would fit most, even an oval end.  The connection is a large stretchy rubber piece so that the end should work with a variety of blow driers.  I like that I can get the fingers against my head to dry there, but there are holes on the outside as well.
"
"
It is an excellent tool for drying, I do not use it whenever I have wither me, rather let hair dry in the open air and then I add volume with this. I usually use it when I'm in a hurry. I like it
"
"
Ended up returning it. Felt like the plastic was going to break everytime I put it on the hairdryer.
"
"
It doesn't fit on my hair dryer.  Might be a great product but if it doesn't fit your dryer it won't work.  All the air leaks out before it gets to the ""fingers"".  Also, it's awkward I poked myself in the face with it more than once before I just gave up and tossed it in the drawer.
"
"
It will not fit my dryer. I have bought and returned 2 additional hair dryers and can not find one it will fit. I wish I would have kept the box so I could return it. It may work well but I'll never be able to find out.
"
"
Broke as soon as I put it on my hair dryer. Never got to use it.
"
"
ANAZING!! It took me 40 years to finally find this hand shaped diffuser!! Perfect for those of us with curly locks (along with my new Curly Locks hair cream.) works just like my hand used to but dries so much faster, even on low heat!
"
"
It’s just ok. Would return if I could
"
"
I actually love the concept but this is the third one I have purchased (since April) and all three melted on to my dryer after a few weeks of using.
"
"
Meh. No better than a regular diffuser for my long curly hair. Waste of money in my opinion. It's sitting in my cupboard.Just turn your head upside down and dry with a regular diffuser.
"
"
I'm really excited to finally have one of these!  I think it works so much better than a regular diffuser attachment.  I had no trouble putting it on my hair dryer.
"
"
Makes your hair curly. Works as described.
"
"
I was really excited to get this because I am a fan of all Deva products but this is not really a big thing. It's just a plastic hand, not too comfortable/easy to use. If I push it too deep into my dryer's mouth, I feel it's going to break.  I didn't return it but I'm also not using it. I prefer a regular round diffuser. Maybe it's a good idea to take it on a trip since it's light and it supposedly fits most hair dryers.
"
"
Perfect gift
"
"
I love what this diffuser does for my curly hair. The problem is it didn't fit on 4 of the 5 dryers I own... This is a pain and, for the cost, I should be able to use it on any dryer.
"
"
I love this hair care line but this will not stay on ether of my hair dryers. Totally makes me sad. I am giving it a 2 star because I know it would work great of it would stay on.
"
"
Works great on adding volume and defining my curls.  Helps cut down on frizz
"
"
Definitely shortens drying time and helps increase volume but I've found it to be very flimsy. One of the arms has already broken off. I'll probably just go back to a regular diffuser once this one breaks (which seems like it will be pretty soon).
"
"
Had to purchase new dryer it didn't fit what I had.The hand is a great design but how you attach it to the dryer makes it difficult to use.
"
"
Waste of money doesn’t work
"
"
Not great. Also my hair dryer sucked my hair into the motor while using.... watch out.
"
"
It works okay. It doesn't work as will as I thought it would. The concept is great but I think my regular diffuser works better and was cheaper. I wouldn't buy it again
"
"
This diffuser does a great job at drying my roots and creating volume.  It seems to help reduce frizz in my 3b, fine, BSL hair.  It fits my dryer well.  The rubber band around the base stretches easily but remains tight to hold it on.  Also it seems pretty sturdy as I have dropped it several times with no cracks or breaks.
"
"
does not fit on normal hair dryer would have been great to know, but with some creative engineering and a clever application of of rubber bands I got it finagled to work and I do like this diffuser it works wonders on my mass of red curls.
"
"
I love this little hand.  It gives my curls a great lift without the frizz!
"
"
My teenager daughter with curly hair likes this item.
"
"
The rubber band ripped the moment I tried to attach this to my dryer. I didn’t even get to try it.
"
"
I returned it. Not impressed with the design at all.  Hard texture. Shape is awkward to use. Doesn't cup baby fine curls. Too expensive.
"
"
Did not fit on my hairdryer at all
"
"
A little hard to use, directions are not that clear.  Still trying to figure it out
"
"
So the main reason that I don’t really like it is because it makes the hair frizzy  :-/
"
"
Ask fit. But once you get it on dryer it performs well.
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE made a huge difference in the shape of my curls. Love all the deva products. This is a curly hair must!!!
"
"
Not my favorite for 2b waves/curls. Hair falls through the fingers.  Sad,  because I wanted to love this a lot.
"
"
Sadly this Devafuser did not fit my regular blow dryer so I had to return it. Its not as universal as said. Would of like the chance to try it...
"
"
This devafuser is awesome it makes it so my hair doesn't fall flat at the roots! If you have curly hair it's a must. I do recommend going to their website so you can see how to use it. It does take longer to use, but its totally worth it!
"
"
I'm impressed with this odd looking tool. I have wavy hair that loves this diffuser. I have little friz and my waves are more curls (if I lay on the floor and dry them)
"
"
I ended up returning this product. One of the biggest selling points for me was the promise of more volume and curl. I get more volume and wave from a blowout. I just wasn't impressed. Also, the product seems weak. The seams started splitting.
"
"
Mine is melting! I don't even use it on high heat either! I've not even used it 10 times.  I only use it when I don't have time to air dry.
"
"
I don't really like to dry my hair with this fuser. But, I have used it only once
"
"
Didn't fit my blower. I had to remove rubberband and hold the tool while holding the blower
"
"
I did love this product and wanted to give it 5 stars.  However, over time it melted and broke.  Very disappointed
"
"
Deep curls! For any girl!!! Ya
"
"
It didn't fit my dryer and it melted😧
"
"
This diffuser Is not universal like the description saids. I am very disappointed.I have tried it on 2 dryers, like another reviewer said what is the point of the adjustable band if you can't adjust it onto the dryer? I don't feel like trying to send it back so I have put a rubber band around it to make sure my dryer does not slip off of it. Hopefully that will work.
"
"
Love this air diffuser to dry my curly hair. It is easy to install in the nose of the hair dryer and easy to use.
"
"
this is a good option, but I prefer the regular rounded diffusers.
"
"
it works really well with curly hair... love it
"
"
I tried to fit this on three different hair dryers, with no success.  On the third attempt, I bent it beyond the point of functionality.  Now I can't return it, nor can I use it.
"
"
Didn't do anything for my hair. Regular diffuser is better.
"
"
This is great for curly girls.  Works better than the traditional diffusers.  It's a bit bulky, so I'm trying to find a hose that I can hook to this and attach it to my hair dryer.
"
"
Works really well with curls. I have short hair, but it would work for long curly hair too.  doesn't frizz your hair, it enhances your curls.
"
"
Works as described.  Can dry my curly locks quicker and ""naturally"" and get better volume than with using clips and a hood dryer.  Love it.
"
"
I have a diffuser that came with my hair dryer already. I wondered what was so great about this Deva diffuser that would make it any better than a regular diffuser. Wow- this is definitely a great purchase! I love, love, love how the air from the hair dryer escapes through the diffuser, surrounding the diffuser. The air dries the hair below and above the diffuser. It is very similar to sitting under the dryer at the salon. My hair is not frizzy after use, like with my other diffuser. This Deva diffuser is NOT to be used with hot air!! I use it with the cool or low temp setting. My waves look healthy and I love that I am not burning my hair with high heat. It fit perfectly on my hair dryer and I really appreciate that it STAYS on the dryer. Fantastic product to use if you are going for the natural curl. I highly recommend!
"
"
After two uses the rubber band broke. Would not recommend.
"
"
Fit's perfectly on my blow dryer and definitely gives me a better volume than a regular diffuser. Which was exactly what I was looking for.
"
"
Love this diffuser. It's a FAST and frizz-free curl drying attachment!The Green Hand Diffuser is borderline a bit creepy looking, but no matter. It does what it's supposed to do, dries curls–  roots and all – FAST and frizz-free, which is the whole point of this product.It attached perfectly to my 2"" diameter blow dryer. I use it on the lower heat as per recommendation. There are lots of YouTube how-to use videos for various hair types.Love having this extra hand around to help with the hair drying.
"
"
Be warned this is not a universal fit.  It specifically did not fit, nor come close to fitting my dryer which is a Centrix QZone.  So I had to send it back.
"
"
Wife loves it. That's all that maters.
"
"
Difficult to handle.
"
"
works well but VERY difficult to get on and off the hair dryer
"
"
This doesn't work without the their branded blow dryer. I sent it back.
"
"
Very little air coming through this piece.  It would take a very long time to dry my hair with this DevaFuser.  It just is not powerful enough fir air to get through, maybe a poor design.
"
"
not universal at all.  was hoping that maybe I had the magic dryer that would fit but should have listened to the other reviewers.  Would just pop off.
"
"
It broke first time I used it
"
"
The head is too small for my hair dryer. I like the idea, but I'm still looking for a hair dryer it will fit on.
"
"
Works great!  Didn't fit on the hair dryer we had, but it was really old, so we got a new one and it works great!
"
"
I can't believe it took me this long to order this! I love it! It came super quick and is everything I expected. Would buy again from seller!
"
"
heavy, hard to use
"
"
Did not fit my dryer. Had to return. Purchased a universal collapsible diffuser from Sally Besuty Supply, works great.
"
"
Love, love, love, this diffuser! I recommend to anyone with curly hair and needs to dry your hair. I wish I had gotten it sooner!
"
"
This is a decent product, but I don't find it to yield much better results than a traditional diffuser which you can find MUCH cheaper. The attachment end of this is extremely small, too, I had to buy a new dryer just to get it to fit.
"
"
Works great once you struggle putting it on the blow dryer That's not deva.
"
"
I'm so disappointed with this diffuser.  It looks revolutionary in its design and does not deliver in the way it's advertised.  First off, it's huge!  I was really surprised at the size and awkwardness of working with it.  I was excited about having a diffuser that could help me dry close to my scalp but soon discovered that the size was hard to manage and that I could only tolerate the lowest settings that close to my head which made the process take twice as long.  I found that by drying from underneath, the top curls were getting frizzy which defeats the purpose.  In addition, I had to wrestle to get it on the end of a standard sized blow dryer (Conair).  I'm going back to my Segabeauty diffuser.  For this price point, I expected much more than I got.
"
"
Did not fit on my hair dryer.
"
"
It's just as I expected. Perfect
"
"
Love this diffuser. fit my dryer perfectly.  love the circulation and the way it dries my hair without making it frizzy. highly recommend.
"
"
It didn't fit my blow dryer. So couldn't try it out.
"
"
So much frizz!  I tried to place the ""hand"" under my curls to get a little volume and it wrecked my hair.  Back to the bowl diffuser.
"
"
Not worth the $$$. I didn't find it helped my curly hair. My ordinary diffuser was better. Great concept but no.
"
"
I love the diffuser -- but you must have a hair dryer with a small enough nozzle to fit the diffuser. I ended up purchasing two before I found one that fit.
"
"
Love love love
"
"
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! Hair dries so much quicker and leaves hair looking more natural.  I wish I had this Years ago!!!
"
"
I like this diffuser, but it's really big and difficult to store. Works great with my hair dryer.
"
"
Didn't fit my hair dryer.
"
"
This circulated too much air in my hair. My hair came out much more frizzy than my regular defuser.
"
"
Best diffuser I've ever had! Love the style. Before receiving it, I was concerned about the weight. Not a problem... it is minimal. Delivered fast.
"
"
Gift
"
"
Great product. Hard to get used to at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll love it.
"
"
A bit challenging as my dryers nozzle is short and wide so I have to hold the diffuser on. I guess I need to purchase a dryer with a longer thinner neck.
"
"
Gift for my daughter. She loves the unique design.
"
"
too big and bulky.  Hard to use.  Doesn't fit all hairdryers.
"
"
Hard to hook to hair dryerDoes not diffuse wellPointless. I like better regular diffuser...
"
"
Doesn't fit every blow drier but works well giving a slower diffused dry for curly hair.
"
"
If I can keep it on one of my dryers better it works great.
"
"
The Deva Curl Deva Fuser adds volume to my curly hair without making it frizzy.  Much better than a standard diffuser!
"
"
I liked the idea of it and enjoy the devacurl products for my swavy hair but this didn't work for me.  Made my hair super frizzy.  I followed the instructions too and barely moved it.  It also didn't fit my dryer.  My regular diffuser works much better.
"
"
Poor design!  Does not fit well on a standard blow dryer
"
"
Didn't fit two dryers I have.  To get it on one dryer had to apply so much pressure feels like it will break.
"
"
My niece loves this
"
"
So far so good. I really like how I can get to my roots easier.
"
"
I was skeptical at first, but I really like how I have better control over where I can put the diffuser. I can get it close to my head and get the roots dry without over drying the ends. I don't know what kind of dryer others have that cause melting bc my dryer can get uncomfortably hot if I use it on the hottest setting. I use mine on a medium heat setting so it isn't painful. The diffuser is a snug fit, and I would not want to take it off and on a lot. I am very pleased with it. Mine cost $25---Half if what I have seen it elsewhere.
"
"
Not what my girls thought it would be. Difficult to use on your own. Very clumsy.
"
"
Fit on my blow dryer with some work. Not very user friendly as it is pretty long sticking off the blow dryer & is a bit cumbersome to use. It does dry your hair well & quickly.
"
"
It takes curls to another level!
"
"
I've only been trying products for my curly hair my entire life-30 years and FINALLY found some products that work! I use the gloves in combination with the difuser. When I travel I'll probably just bring the gloves only. The difuser is definetly odd looking and don't forget to put the rubber band on to secure it over your blow dryer or else it will pop off like every other difuser in the world. So happy with these products!
"
"
I like this attachment...however it doesn’t stay on my blow dryer. That was disappointing.
"
"
I have very short curly hair and I didn't realize that this is more for longer curly hair.  I do use it, and it does decrease the frizz, but it doesn't do a good job  of lifting my short curly hair from the roots.
"
"
Was so excited to finally receive this in the mail.  I used it several times over the course of a week before writing my review, just to give it more than one opportunity.  Completely unimpressed by how it worked.  It mostly just increased the frizziness of my hair, and didn't help set the curl at all.  It wasn't a TERRIBLE product, but totally not worth the $30+ price tag.  I'll stick to my bowl diffuser which works better for me.  I ended up returning this.
"
"
Best diffuser ever.  Whish I had purchased sooner.
"
"
It was great in the salon, but didn't fit my hair dryer, so I had to return it.  The vendor was great.
"

I was skeptical that any styling tool would actually improve the way my hair looks. I have extremely curly hair, and a lot of it, and usually when I mess with it more than conditioning and detangling as gently as possible with a wide toothed comb, things go downhill quickly. The DevaFuser totally won me over. It gives me so much volume without sacrificing definition or stretching out my curls. A must try for any curly girl.

It looks totally weird but works like a charm.

For wife.

Use this every day. This is a great invention.

Love it ! Great for curly hair

I love it

This hair tool works easily and well.  The band on the cuff helps it fit on most dryers.It distributes heat so much easier and consistently to dry curly hair faster; a much better diffuser than the standard ones out there.It a quality and durable product.Plus... It is perfect for drying your small pets hair; especially those who are afraid of the dryer and those with hair that tangles!

Perfect for curly hair
"
"
Fits both my hair dryers and works great!
"
"
Love this! I had the deva dryer with diffuser for a couple of years and was amazed by the results vs a regular diffuser. When my deva dryer died I was devistated. So happy to have this cheaper alternative to buying the dryer again!
"
"
This seemed so bizarre at first. I had guests over and they made fun of the way it looked. I could not live without this now! I didn't want to spend all the money to buy the DevaCurl blow dryer so this was a nice compromise. Works great on my own blow dryer, and does wonders for my hair. I used a regular diffuser for years and years before buying this one, recentlyI tried using a regular defuser when I was on vacation, and it just wasn't the same. I won't be looking back.
"
"
This is an amazing product.  It works and then some!  If you want curlier hair, buy this product!
"
"
If you have curly hair, you gotta get this. What i like about it the most, is that it has ventilators holes all over the place. It drys your hair evenly, and its very lightweight. However, it does not fit every blow dryer nozzle. I took mine to Target and tried a few of the sample one they had out, to see which one it would fit on best. Definetely use this for your curls, it makes them look sensational!!
"
"
It's not worth the money based on the product not sure if you have to use devacurl products in order for the diffuser to work but it was very difficult to get your hair in the hands and make your hair as curly as it would be if you were using a normal diffuser
"
"
After years of lusting over the shape of this diffuser, I became ecstatic when I noticed it is now available as a universal adapter. Sadly, I dont think this is an effective diffsuer.  It fits my hairdryer just fine but doesn't perform as well as my cup dryer.  My cup diffuser still does all the heavy-lifting to dry my hair.  I might pop on the devafuser to spot dry hard to reach areas of my head.
"
"
great

Awesome new hair accessory
"

LOVE
"
"
Overpriced and ridiculous. Returned it.
"
"
I like this curly diffuser, but like some people, I don't think it necessarily works any better than a regular diffuser.  I have difficulty keeping volume up top, and this doesn't do much better than a regular diffuser.  I know there were also complaints about it melting or not fitting, and I had mine on high and the hottest setting and haven't had any issues.  It also pretty easily fit over the end of my hot tools hair dryer.
"
"
My daughter loved it! It fit perfectly on her blowdryer
"
"
Returned it. Did not work as claimed. Kept sliding off my hairdryer.
"
"
Love this diffuser!
"
"
This diffuser is a great concept and I do like it BUT the choice of material is very poor. It didn't take long for it to melt and come apart.  I use it low heat and it is curling into a fist. There is a huge gap at the seams. I have it almost 3 months and I don't know how much longer it will last. After each use I have to try and push and mold it back into shape I am very disappointed in this diffuser at $26.
"
"
At first I needed to find a hairdryer that would fit the defuser (some are too short,others too wide and one was just right!) once the right hairdryer was identified the defuser worked well. This product is different from regular diffusers.  I have curly hair and it dries it well without making it frizzy.  It's a little awarkward and heavy to use but I presume I will get used to it and use it as well as my hair stylist.
"
"
This diffuser does not fit on normal hair dryers.  I think they made it that way so you buy their hair dryer also.
"
"
I have naturally curly/wavy hair and this diffuser does a pretty good job at forming well shaped and non-frizzy curls. I love that the fingers dry hair from the inside out so you don't end up with dry, brittle, frizzy ends before the rest is dry. It fits fine on my Revlon hair drier from Target, if it seems too small for your drier nozzle try pushing the rubber band on the diffuser up higher toward the ""fingers"" and that will give you a little more wiggle room. The only reason I took a star off is because this is my second one. I didn't realize that it is SO heat sensitive. I used my first one with the blow drier on high heat and it it melted pretty badly, to the point where the fingers were all warped and there were huge holes and gaps where there shouldn't be. It was blowing out way too much air and didn't work as a diffuser very well anymore. After I ordered a second one I ONLY use it on medium heat at medium speed because I'm afraid it will melt again. I wish they had put some kind of warning on the package saying high heat will ruin the product.
"
"
So far I am pleased with my purchase.
"
"
The DevaFuser is a bit more expensive ther regular defusers, but it was worth the additional cost and I highly recommended it.
"
"
Makes my daily routine much easier!!
"
"
The concept is great, and it works really well to keep hair frizz-free and curls looking great. But it unfortuanately melted within a week of using it, and it blew out my hair dryer so I had to buy a new one. Possible trouble with the airflow?
"
"
Extremely small shaft. Would only fit a blow dryer with a diameter of 1 1/2 inches.
"
"
Really awkward to use, and definitely can't take it to travel with you as the attachment is huge. I was so excited about this but once I got it and physically saw how giant it is it was a no for me. Had to return and stick to regular diffusers.
"
"
Didn't fit my two hairdryers, their measurement for compatibility was way off.You're better off buying the entire deva set if you want the diffuser.If you're in a time crunch stick a thin shirt or sock over the dryer's nosel and you're good to go for now until you get the diffuser that you like.Chi is good too.
"
"
The picture is the dryer, but they send u just the diffuser, which is really expensive for what it is
"
"
This definately works if you want to make your natural curls, curlier. =)
"
"
If you've got a curly perm or natural curls Run and buy this , it is fabulous, I love love love mine!!!  You may have to stretch the rubber part quite a bit the first time you put it on your dryer. I've had mine quite a while now and I can dry my curly perm fast and ez and it's holding up great!
"
"
Using this difuser has changed my hair care.  I now can wash and dry my thick wavy curls in less time and have dry hair on a cold day.  Plus the structure of the difuser adds lift and height to my heavy hair!  A win win for me!
"
"
This product works great. It does what it said it would in the description. I am please with my diffuser.
"
"
this product would not stay on my dryer the band that holds it on is very thin would not last very long and is very awkward to try to use i have very curly hair i was really disappointed that it did not work was very excited when i saw this im sending it back its not worth 44 dollars
"
"
I was hoping this would be a solution for my frizzy curls.  Not to be. It is a very clever idea and it does penetrate to the roots of my hair.  It is ok but is very large/long and makes my hair dryer difficult to fit anywhere when it is attached.  And it is difficult to attach to my dryer :(
"
"
This worked well, I really liked it. BUT the quality is awful. I have had it only a few months and it broke at the area where the screws are. For the price I paid for it, it should be constructed so much better.
"
"
Was written in the description that can be used on almost all hair dryers.  That is NOT true....have now purchased 3 dryers and it still does not fit properly.  So still have not be able to even use it.
"
"
My hair isn't as frizzy now!  My hair seems to be more soft and smooth.  Also dries hair more quickly.
"
"
I wanted it to work but I never even got to try it because I couldn't get it to go on my hair dryer, which seems to be a pretty standard size. I should have measured my hair dryer before ordering. I returned it.
"
"
Product worked great till it melted. So sad :(
"
"
LOVE this diffuser!! I have very curly hair and using this has been key for a low frizz look on days i can't let my hair air dry.Highly recommend this if you have curly hair :)
"
"
We purchased this DEVA CURL diffuser and used it a few times with my Chi hairdryer. It started changing its shape as if the product got soft from the medium heat.There were no directions on how to use it. I wouldn't purchase it again.
"
"
We wish it fit short nosed hair dryers too!
"
"
saved money buying this attachment and not the whole Deva blow dryer for 140 something $. It did not fit my Conair 1875 blow dryer but it fit perfectly on my Hot Tools professional 1069S blow dryer.
"
"
This is a very gentle way of blow drying my hair.  It's also pretty slow but I like that it reduces the frizz that I normally get with a regular defuser. It fit my blowdryer just fine and I traveled with it and used it with the tiny hotel hair dryers.  I haven't used it on a ""hot"" setting because people said it melted so I can't say that it works well with high heat.
"
"
Purchased at wifes request, she likes this for her long curly hair....I dont think she needs it as she's beautiful the moment she gets up in the morning.  But she likes this.
"
"
I really like this. Does the trick for me. I have baby fine hair so use the Deva clips too. Initially, I did have trouble getting it on my dryer and thought it was too small. Then, I realized I just needed to adjust the big rubbery band at the base (That's not shown in the photo). I wonder if that's why so many people have a problem. Once you move the rubber piece toward the ""fingers"", the base opens fairly wide, you stick your dryer in and then work the rubbery band back up until it fits tightly around the nozzle.  At its widest, seems like it would fit most hair dryers.
"
"
This crazy-looking attachment is fantastic for loving your curls when drying!  The only challenge was getting the darn thing on my dryer.  I really had to push harder than expected, but when it finally slipped on it is secure and works perfectly.This is great for gently holding up your curls while drying so they stay nicely formed and not frizzy.  It is also handy to dry the roots to achieve a nice lift.  I highly recommend this item.It is much cheaper to buy this attachment to put on any kind of dryer than buy the whole kit.
"
"
This does a nice job of diffusing, but I don't believe it is superior to other diffusers. For the price, I thought it was going to be something extra special. It isn't.
"
"
I was trying to figure out before I bought this if it fit the T3 hairdryer.  I read a review that said that it did, so I got it.  Alas, it does not.  It seems like it's a great product.  Wish they made it more universal, and wish the description was clearer about fit.  Fortunately, I have Prime and didn't have to pay return shipping.
"
"
The price is better on this than when I purchased. I wish I had returned mine because at almost forty dollars, it was a HUGE rip off.  It's just a diffuser, yeah it's okay, but nothing really more or less. Don't get your hopes up too high.  If you have had a good diffuser, the results won't be different if your curls are anything like mine (thin hair, lots of volume, loose curls with frizz).  So at $25 dollars, I' wouldn't advise another friend not to purchase but anything more and I'd say you're getting ripped off.
"
"
This diffuser is great.  Forget the reviews that say it won't fit.  You just need a brain that can conquer the complexities of devices as complicated as a rubber band and you'll have no problem.  I used this on twelve different blow dryers while traveling through Ireland and it fit them all and it never came close to melting.  Do be warned, the TSA will feel the need to go through your bag when this shows up on the x-ray.  Stay curly.
"
"
Recommended by our daughter's stylist.  He used it with great effect on her curly hair, which had just gotten a pixie cut.
"
"
This diffuser is comparable to the cheap ones that come with your hair dryer. It has does very little to obstruct the air flow, and even after experimenting with several different angles/holds it still visibly blew my hair around even with my dryer in its lowest setting--which is something no diffuser should do! Consequently it dries (too) fast and most curly hair will be left frizzy. I'd definitely recommend less expensive options like Helen of Troy or Hot Socks that have much better air obstruction for half the price tag. Even my DevaCurl hair stylist struggles to recommend this product.
"
"
Great diffuser. Minimal frizz when I use this diffuser vs others. Fits into most dryers.
"
"
I am curly-hair challenged. Use this with a gentle flow from a blow dryer and your curls will be what you always hoped they would be.
"
"
As I measured before ordering, the DevaFuser fits perfectly on my dryer. Probably best for long curly hair; mine is short, but I get a nice tousled look. Would definitely recommend.
"
"
Love love love. Let your hair dry a little before using the diffuser for more defined curls and volume!
"
"
HUGE!  Way TOO big to use on my head.
"
"
Diffuser neck is small/doesn't expand much, so I'm gonna have to get another hair dryer.
"
"
Not for fine curls
"
"
Didn't work, sent it back,
"
"
Small nozzle, does not fit all type hair blow dryer
"
"
I thought this diffuser would fit on most dryers....not!!!  So, I will either sell this or spend another ""lots of $"" to make it work, but looks like I cannot buy just the dryer and would have to buy the set!  Sure is disappointing!
"
"
I LOVE the design of this defuser! My hair is surrounded by heat while drying so I experience less shrinkage.
"
"
Did not like it.  It didn't really work like my traditional diffuser.  I would not recommend it.
"
"
Love it
"
"
I love this diffuser!  But it sat in my closet for three months because I thought it wouldn't fit on my hair dryer.  I was disappointed because after the stylist at the salon used it, my hair looked amazing.  Having curly hair, I am used to failed products, so I searched for a hair dryer I could use with this.  Then I read a review that explained it all, so I'm passing this along - push the elastic band all the way ""up"" towards the fingers, slide the diffuser onto the end of the hairdryer, and then wiggle the elastic band down around the nozzle.  It works!
"
"
I have used deva curl products for approx. 5-6 years now and  I absolutely love their products....except this.  I had the very first one they made and it was great until it started popping off of the blow dryer and eventually the prongs inside of it broke.  So I bought this one...last fall...I straighten my hair in the winter and go curly in the warmer months. I used this for the first time a cpl of wks ago and it was going good until I realized it was losing its shape and when I looked at it, it was melted!!!  Not a very safe product.  I will be returning this.
"
"
Thank you.
"
"
I did  return this as I found it unwieldy to hold and not really useful for short hair which I have.
"
"
Doesn't fit the hairdryer my wife has--the air nozzle is too wide to fit.  We'll have to buy a different dryer to try it.
"
"
Melted during 1st use
"
"
Didn't fit my hairdryer. Thick and bulky. Wasted my money on this one. Got a hot sock instead that works great.
"
"
Works wonders!
"
"
I anguished to buy this diffuser after reading all the reviews about it melting or not fitting on the hairdryer, the price, and all the other negative reviews.  I eventually bought it and am 100% happy that I did.  This is such a great diffuser!On the melting aspect:  I wonder what temperature people are setting their hairdryers on to MELT PLASTIC?  Hello.....if it is melting plastic, imagine what it is doing to your hair people! The point of any Deva product is to protect hair from damage. I use this several times per week and have had zero issues with melting.On the fabulous diffuser:  I love, love, love, LOVE this diffuser!  The ""fingers"" slip into areas of my hair around my head in ways that a traditional diffuser cannot.  For example, I can slide it *into* the curls instead of just scrunching them.  It gives me great lift at the roots.  I use the cool setting on my hairdryer, which isn't cold air, it has some warmth. Often I usually alternate with the warm setting, but if I use that too long then my scalp starts to feel too hot and uncomfortable.  I dry my hair about 80% of the way as the manufacturer suggests, then let it air dry the rest of the way.  Usually as I drive into work.  When I get to work I take out my clips, flip my head over, scrunch my curls......and BAM!  Awesome hair day!  It took me a few tries to figure out how to use this tool with my hair, at first I was getting crazy '80's hair.  Not that I figured it out it works great every time.  I have to be careful to keep the diffuser in one place on my head for awhile like the instructions say, as this reduces frizz.  If I scrunch my hair too much with the diffuser then it breaks my curl cast and my hair looks a little frizzy.  Don't be afraid though, you just have to be patient with your hair and the drying process.  I'm a nurse who gets up at the crack of dawn or earlier, and don't have a lot of time to do my hair in the mornings.  So don't think I'm putting a lot of effort into this, because I'm not (It's really great).On the fit with my hairdryer:  I have a Rusk ""deep shine"".  That's all I know about it.  The first few times getting the diffuser on the hair dyer I had to really shove it on, twist it back-and-forth, etc.  Now I can get it on easily, but it still fits snugly around the hairdyer.  The circumference of my hairdryer is about 6 1/4"" and the diameter is just under 2"", if that helps anyone.DevaCurl everything has transformed my hair from blah to wowza curls!
"
"
Ok, so this diffuser definitely gave me lots of volume...love big hair; however, I had a lot of frizz as well. It fits my blowdryer perfectly, but my dryer (Hot Tools Tourmaline Tools 2000) has a narrow nozzle. It was easy to use...and my hair dried quickly.  Overall, I was not impressed by the end result.  My regular diffuser attachment does a much better job...and without the frizz.  Although I'm disappointed, I will give it another try as I want to believe in this!
"
"
I had the older version of the DevaFuser (and blow-dryer).  My Deva stylist had it and I loved it.  While being there for a cut one time, my son accidentally knocked hers off the counter and busted her dryer.  So I gave her mine.  I missed it while using a Hot Shot Tools dryer I bought from Sally's and a diffuser.  While it was nice, it didn't work like this (gentle without tornado-like speed whipping my curls around into a frizzy mess). When I saw this and that it would work with ""most"" dryers, I figured I'd give it a try.  I read the reviews - one person said it melted...goodness, what kind of dryer do you have? Mine is 1875w, which is pretty high.  Anyway, I got this, ripped it out of the box and took it to meet my blow-dryer.  They fell in love.  This was a little difficult to get over the barrel initially but once I did, it was harmonious unity! I couldn't wait to actually use it.  I am a very routine-Deva user (DevaCare No Poo, One Condition, ArcAngel gel mixed with Styling Creme, using the Deva towels or cheese cloth to dry/scrunch, don't wash daily, co-wash in between deep washings, etc.).  So this was what my curls needed.  While I don't follow the ""hold in each spot for two minutes"", it still works.I worked the back with getting in a bulk of my hair into it gently and letting it work there for awhile, then moved to the sides.  After they got to a drier point, I moved it to the roots gently and blasted with cold air.  I use the clips to help with lifting roots.  Once my hair completely dries, I can remove the clips, rescrunch hair gently to remove the gel cast and I have soft, shiny, beautiful curls.This DevaFuser is worth it if you are looking to dry your curls carefully.  It is pretty universal - I'd assume thicker barrels would be harder to get on it (mine is 1.75"").  The band that holds the bottom of the fuser together is a very strong, thick 'rubber-band'.  It took some time to work it on, but now that it's on, it's not going anywhere...and that's okay.  Make sure you slide it all the way on so there is no loss of air flow through the bottom part of the 'hand'.I'm very happy with it, along with the fast shipping.  One of the best investments I've made towards my journey on beautiful curly hair!
"
"
A regular diffuser does just a good of job, this is over priced and I does not seem to be able to handle the heat because it is coming apart.
"
"
The devafuser is a good option for curly haired gals. I would have like to have given this product a higher rating as at FIRST, the performance it pretty good. I little awkward, but if you can get passed the ergonomics, then it does work really well! What I am giving the low rating for is that that this things melts!!!!!!!!! The fingers curl so bad that it cracks the dang thing!  I thought maybe MAYBE mine was a rare thing, BUT both my sister and I own this product and BOTH melted. So deva curl needs to make or REMAKE something that will withstand heat and curly hair...
"
"
I knew that Deva was going to be doing a re-design of the hand fuser, and have been patiently waiting over a year for it to come out.  I just got done drying my hair with this for the first time -- and LOVE it!I have fine, 2C waves, and this gently dried them, with minimal frizz.  After plopping my hair in a microfiber towel, I then usually just dry my hair with a blowdryer to about 60% dry, before letting it air dry the rest of the way.  Using this helped create the best frizz-free curls I've ever had!It does get hot, so you'll want to use this on low heat and low air flow with your dryer.  (If your hair blows around too much, it will create frizz.)On the box, it also shows you a few drawings for how to position this in your hair to get it to dry.  I have hair that when stretched reaches to the top of my waist, and it got my hair mostly dry in about ten minutes with my T3 Featherweight dryer.  To do the mid-lengths, I cupped the ends gently in the hand, and let it sit there a few minutes.To see if the fit really is universal, I tried this on my cheapie Conair dryer, my T3 Featherweight (the regular model), and my Sedu Revolution.  It fits my Conair and my T3, but not my Sedu, which has a pretty wide nozzle.  I ordered it on the Nordie's website so that I could return it in case it didn't fit any of my dryers, but was happy to see that it really is almost universal, unlike other diffusers I've bought.Give this a try if you have curls or waves!  It definitely brings them out in the best possible way!UPDATE ON 1-12-13:  I am still absolutely in LOVE with this diffuser!  I didn't think it would create much volume, but it really does!  It makes my waves look better than they ever have, and my hair has volume and soft, frizz-free texture.  This really is amazing!
"
"
Mine lasted for about 2 years (using it an average of 2 times per week) and I did feel like it did a better job on my hair than standard diffusers. I was using with a Conair hair dryer and while the product advertises that it can accommodate other brands, it just broke.  The stretchy band is still in tact, the plastic must have weakened with the high heat because it cracked just above the stretchy band and the diffuser is unusable now because it cannot grip onto my hair dryer anymore.  I've never had a standard diffuser break before so I will attribute this to either bad product design, inaccurate marketing material, defective product materials or all of the above.
"
"
I love this.  I started using Deva hair products and was just using a diffuser on my hair dryer.  I decided to try this attachment for my hair dryer.  It fits on just fine on my Tool Science Nano Silver Lightweight Hair Dryer (which is great hairdryer by the way).  I didn't buy this thru Amazon but at an Ulta store.  I paid more for it ($50.) but I wanted to be able to return it.  It has worked out great and I really like the way it dries my hair...much much better than using a regular diffuser.  I've had it 2 months and use it almost every day and no problems with melting or anything.  I used it on med heat and speed most of the time.  I definitely recommend it for people who use Deva Products.
"
"
Used for 5 minutes, worked great until the band holding it into the dryer broke and the thing flew off. Too much$ for poor design. Deva Curl needs to fix.
"
"
Overpriced for the results I got. I was hopeful but skeptical of this attachment. I am a 3b/3a (according to naturallycurly.com). I bought the DevaCurl dryer and diffuser and tried them 3 times using my normal hair products in slightly different order the second and 3rd times which consist of the bed head line and catwalk curls rock. My results with this dryer was less curl definition thanI was getting with my $20 revlon or conner dryers with a $10 non branded diffuser attached. My hair was also a bit more flat and frizzy. I decided to save my money and go back to my old faithfuls.I also used this blow dryer and diffuser with the devacurl product starter kit. which was another disappointment. I had heard such great reviews on the DevaCurl line and while I was happy with my curls, I am always open to try new products. I was pretty disappointed in the products when I got frizzier results than my hair normally is. I even tried the devacurl products with my faithful old blowdryer and diffuser and my hair had good curl definition again, but it was much frizzier than it is with my usual product combination.Overall, if I wasn't happy with my curls already with definition and hold, I think I might have liked the devacurl products. So if you are not happy with your curls this might be a good set up for you to use. After years of trying multiple products in different orders of application, I found a great combination of products to use for my hair.Everybody's curly hair is different so be open to trying more things. My hair does best with a mousse and hangs limply when I use gel instead of mousse. Ulta and some other beauty supply stores will let you return a product as long as at least half of it is left and you are within the return time frame so don't be afraid to try new things when you have conformation you can return it if it doesn't work out for you.
"
"
The DevaFuser was difficult to use.  It was hard to attach to the blow dryer and it seemed to slip off easily.  To get it to stay on, I had to grip the diffuser around the neck, and that was just too hot on my hand.  I gave up.
"
"
Ok - I read all the raving reviews and thought that I would try this product.  OMG it is truly fabulous.  My hair just got 90 percent easier and quicker to do and looks 100 percent better.  More waves - more curls - I never have to use the curling iron now.  I love this product!
"
"
Just threw this in the trash.  Such a disappointment since it cost as much as a hair dryer and was highly recommended.As a diffuser, it is great.  Unfortunately, it only lasted about 18 months, then it started falling apart.I tried my friend's circular diffusing hair dryer.  It worked just as well as this did, so I order that today.
"
"
This defuser works but it takes a lot of time... Which defeats the purpose.. I would not recommend if in a time crunch..
"
"
My issue is it won't fit any of my dryers. It slides right off.
"
"
I've only been embracing my wavy hair for almost two years now.  I've attempted other diffuser with mixed results.  The design of this diffuser helps dry my hair while minimizing frizz and creating fantastically defined waves.  I only wish that I bought it sooner.
"
"
Too small for my dryer. Had to return it
"
"
My stylist used this on me and it was Superbly Awesome.  It truly lifts you curls.
"
"
A little big and clunky. I guess it does the job ok. I don't know if it's any better than another diffuser or a cloth cover.
"
"
I have been using this product for a couple of years but always got it from a local store. I needed more quickly so decided to try Amazon. I may be paranoid but the smell blew me away when I received it. Then my hair dried out and began falling out in clumps in the shower. And the flakes! After it dries my hair feels like straw and flakes go everywhere. I luckily had the end of another bottle (from the local store) and the smell is pleasant not pungent. I swear the Amazon version is not real?!?! I have to stop using it out of sheer paranoia. So disappointed!
"
"
I love Deva products. I had purchased a different presentation of this product and loved it so I purchased bigger container here at Amazon. The texture of the product is different, so I called DevaCurl directly and they told me that the vendor is not authorized and that I could be getting product that has been manipulated (watered  down)... price different is significant $40 for buying at manufacturer website
"
"
I have naturally thick, coarse, shoulder-length curls and my hair is also color-treated. Prior to discovering this product at a salon, I thought only very greasy products could control my frizz and define my curls, but of course I would be left with greasy residue in my hair all the time. I’m also an adherent to the Deva philosophy of using much less shampoo— at this point I condition and rinse every other day, and only shampoo about once a week. The B’Leave-In is my daily savior. It has a very fresh, citrusy smell (like lemongrass) and leaves my head smelling like the aromatherapy aisle at Whole Foods! (The scent disippates in an hour or so and won’t clash with your perfume). It is liquify and light, almost like a very light-hold gel; you won’t get crunchy hair or tight hold with this at all, but it will keep the frizz in check and keep your hair smoothed down, even in the rain! The best part is that it rinses cleanly (no oil, no silicone) and there is no build-up. Great stuff, and a 16-ounce bottle lasts me a couple months.

This product is my holy grail. I have ALWAYS struggled with frizz and undefined curls and I’ve used all sorts of different products ranging from leave in conditioners to pomades to mouse and gel. Nothing has worked for me as well as this has!A little tip for those using this for the first time: untangle your hair and part it in small sections, use only on sopping wet hair. If you have a lot of hair, apply generously until hair is wet and silky and then scrunch the excess out.After you’ve applied to your entire head, diffuse, diffuse, diffuse!This plumper is completely weightless and leaves hair smelling so good!

Do not order Deva products from Amazon!!! This product felt water downed and doesn’t work as good and you will be wasting your money. I have also tried using other devacurl products from Amazon and they have all felt the same. I went to purchase real Deva products from a lincense Salon in my area and they told me that most of the products are fake on amazon or it’s not devacurl. They have tested the difference themselves and it may be the Devacurl Bottle but the product inside isn’t. Best places to buy are on the website, Ulta or lincense Salons.

In using the product B’Leave-In by Deve Curl I have found a great love for it. Deva Curl has brought my hair to life again. Using B’Leave-In has rekindled my love of my hair. I would recommend this to anyone and it’s worth every dollar.
"
"
The pump  was broken when I opened the box:( so I was already upset at amazon but I figure I’ll make it work and try it before I return this. So I did and it left my hair feeling so dry. I hear and read great reviews on all devacurl products, but it did  not work well on my 3c/4a curls:( sadly I am returning this and I’m just gonna stick with my sheamoisture JBCO leave in:) that line works better for my hair and less expensive too!

This is a great product, I've used it for years.  What I received from Amazon, however, was definitely not DevaCurl. It is not the product I've been using. It immediately dried out my hair.  I had to throw the whole bottle out, which was a complete waste of money.  At first I wondered if DevaCurl changed the formula, but I've since purchased from Sephora several times which is the product I know/love. Purchase from Sephora, Ulta, or direct from Devacurl instead. Wanted to give this 0 starts, but it wasn't an option.
"
"
I've been using this for over a year now and my hair is healthy, soft, and looks great. The key with devacurl is to use the right product line for your curl type. There are lots of options and it may take some experimenting before you find the right product mix and amount. I think it's well worth the effort.
"
"
This is an excellent product to get and create plump fluffy curls. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because if you are heavy handed with the product (as I am with regular gel like products), it will build up and flake. Therefore, I combine this with light defining gel and get the perfect big, voluminous curls.
"
"
I have been using this product for a couple of years but always got it from a local store. I needed more quickly so decided to try Amazon. I may be paranoid but the smell blew me away when I received it. Then my hair dried out and began falling out in clumps in the shower. And the flakes! After it dries my hair feels like straw and flakes go everywhere. I luckily had the end of another bottle (from the local store) and the smell is pleasant not pungent. I swear the Amazon version is not real?!?! I have to stop using it out of sheer paranoia. So disappointed!
"
"
I love Deva products. I had purchased a different presentation of this product and loved it so I purchased bigger container here at Amazon. The texture of the product is different, so I called DevaCurl directly and they told me that the vendor is not authorized and that I could be getting product that has been manipulated (watered  down)... price different is significant $40 for buying at manufacturer website

I have naturally thick, coarse, shoulder-length curls and my hair is also color-treated.

Arrive with  broken top with some of the contents spilled all over inside the box. I've odered from here with no problem so will just use the top from my old bottle and swallow the spilled product. I absolutely love this product - my hair hold its curl without being stiff and looking wet.
"
"
If you are a curly or wavy hair girl you should try this product.  You scrunch it into wet or damp hair and let your hair dry.  Then scrunch out the crunch.  As a wavy girl who likes being a curly girl, this does the trick.  I use it daily and the regular sized tube gets used up way to quickly.  I'm thankful to find this large size as it is much more economical.
"
"
this product does a great job at holding my curls and i have soft curls that would easily ""wilt"" without this product. it holds the curls even better than the deva angel (which is also a good product).. great price too! very expensive in hair salons.
"
"
I have fine curly hair, which means most gels are too heavy for my hair.  This leaves it bouncy and springy without drying it out.  Looks great on day 2.  I buy it all the time, even though its a little expensive.
"
"
From someone who used to use a lot of products to get the style I wanted, I felt like I needed more than just the 3 step process. So I bought this and I actually like it. Not sure if it really does anything extravagant compared to the conditioner and ultra defining gel, but for my second day hair, instead of using more gel, I add some of this mixed with a little gel and my hair looks wonderful.I only bought a 12 ounce bottle of the One Condition, so I didn't want to kill it, so I share that work with the leave on. I like it, it adds volume, shine. And definition. I use it in soaking wet hair and dry hair,
"
"
I bought this after I started using other Deva curl products. It has since become necessary to my morning routine to keep my frizz taned and my curls soft and full. I apply it after the light defining gel and it makes a huge difference!
"
"
I have 4a corkscrew hair and This product does plump up my curls but I can't use it alone.  The instructions say to completely rinse out the One Condition but if I do that my hair is very dry under this product so I don't wash it out.  I use this as a styling product, not as a conditioner.  I really like the slip.  It does create foam in your hair but I just squeeze most of that down the drain.  I don't think this will be a staple product for me from the line though.
"
"
Great product, mix with gel for fine curly hair. Packaging had plastic wrap around bottle top to bottom and pressure broke the pump. Luckily I still have a bottle and used that pump, otherwise Inwould have been greatly disappointed.
"
"
Great smoothing base for hair product application! Worth the cost of buying all products together! Don’t skip this step!!!
"
"
Product is lightweight, leaves hair feeling soft. Helps to detangle, makes wet curls easy to work with.
"
"
Does hold curls all day. Won’t flake. I definitely recommend it.
"
"
This really does plump up the curls.  Use it as directed though.  It's not a hair gel.
"
"
This product is awesome. It holds my curls but is soft to the touch. It can be made into a spray by adding water if you want. Great price too!
"
"
This worked much better for me than the gel, much less stiff but still helped by fine, thin wavy curls. One quarter-size squirt is plenty for my past-the-shoulders hair. Much more natural looking than the gel.
"
"
Very cool product. Expensive but it really works
"
"
Easy to use. Great smell!
"
"
Love the stuff
"
"
Perfect! I mix this with my leave in conditioner and it gives me a great hold with no crunch!
"
"
Perfect for what i needed! Affordable and the right product! I don't use it every day but 3-4 times a week, and its lasted me for 2-3 months and I still have some left. I love this product for curly hair
"
"
pretty good, not the best curl gel I have ever used, but It does smell really good.
"
"
its good stuff
"
"
DevaCurl is a great product for curly hair. It keeps my curls defined. My hair is less frizzy. I’ve been using it for 6 years along with the DevaCurl lowpoo shampoo
"
"
It's not sticky or greasy, and you can use it generously or sparsely as your hair requires. Scrunch it in to very wet hair and then dab or scrunch dry with a cloth or tshirt. I'm now addicted to it. The devacurl products are worth every penny.
"
"
I love this stuff! It's much lighter than the an-gel. I have wavy hair with curls in the back and it gives me soft curls that hold. It's a little frizzy right after diffusing, but it tames down after an hour or so and I have the nicest curls!
"
"
This product dries out my hair.
"
"
Very pleased and will buy again if needed.  Thank you!
"
"
This is NOT a leave in conditionar, it is more of a styling gel.  Left hair feeling stiff and heavy. Love other Deva Curl products but not this one
"
"
This product works great! However, the shipping was very disappointing. The pump was fully open and unprotected. The bottle has about 2 inches of product missing. My other bottles came in a protective plastic wrap but this one didn't.
"
"
Love it! It took a while for me to get used to this product when I first started using it, but now I can't imagine my hair routine without it! By far the best lightweight gel around.
"
"
Love this item. Leave my hair soft and hold curls. Thank you fast transaction.
"
"
You only need a little bit of this if you have African American curly hair that is loose. If you put too much in, it will flake. If you can figure out the amount best for your hair, you'll love this product.
"
"
I Love this product but why has it gone up $7.00 for the same amount?
"
"
No Good!
"
"
I love this product ! It really brings out my curls !!
"
"
if you have curly hair this product is a must!
"
"
Boosts my curls and makes my hair really soft. Great for use in the winter after no-poo. I follow up with a tiny amount of deva set it up and above styling pomade to give my curls extra definition and hold.
"
"
Love this product! Use on dry hair to make curls more defined.
"

For several years I had been straightening my curly hair even though I prefer the curls. That was because it was mostly unmanageable and frizzy, and would usually start looking strange and lose its bounce by the third week from the products I used.I decided to try the DevaCurl line, and started with the One Conditioner and the Angel gel. It looked alot better than before, but the gel was making my hair dry. I was advised to switch to the leave-in and the styling cream instead of the gel.I have been using it now for several months, and it's looking healthier and healthier.I wash my hair with the low poo, then add the conditioner. I wash some of the conditioner out but leave most of it. I use a paper towel to get rid of the dripping water, or use my hands, then I immediately add in a good chunk of leave-in conditioner. I use the styling cream after and blow dry it with a diffuser (much better curl definition than letting it air-dry). Looks great for at least two days. I sometimes use the mister to put some bounce back into it on the 2nd or 3rd day.I usually don't use gels or products that make my hair feel unnatural, and when I was told to use all these products I was worried it might weigh my curls down or feel gunky, but it doesn't at all. Hope this review helps.
"
"
Another wonderful product from DevaCurl. It's a leave-in that's wet enough to use on dry hair as a finishing, smoothing product, but thick enough to sink into wet hair and make it lovely and soft. Love it!
"
"
I have used this product in tube form for years to reduce frizz, enhance curl but in this dispenser it is even better
"
"
Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!! I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time. I have recommended this products to all my curly-haired friend. So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...DevaCurl or DevaCare is it!!
"
"
Bottle arrived with broken too, no pump
"
"
I love devacurl
"
"
Best leave in ever! Keeps my curls in tact as well as retaining moisturize.
"
"
Love this product. It’s lightweight and helps define curls softly and not crisp.
"
"
I love this stuff
"
"
I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better! I use the B'Leave in Curl Booster, the Set It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition and I love all of them.I have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair. I am so glad my stylist put me on to it. WOOHOO!!
"
"
My daughter introduced me to the Deva Curl products and I was impressed. They worked great on my curls.
"
"
I'm tossed with this product, my stars are 3.5, but that's not an option. I'll have to play around with it to see what works best.
"
"
this product is wonderful HOWEVER it arrived broken and the pump does not work! i have to manually pour it into my hand. won’t buy from here again.
"
"
The point of buying such a large bottle is that it will last a long time, but this one must have already been old when it was sent to me because after 2 weeks the whole thing smelled sour and rancid, and was totally unusable. Waste of money.
"
"
Meh, didn’t work for me.. not worth the money and wouldn’t use again. This wasn’t moisturizing or conditioning at all in my hair. Instead, it got really flaky after drying. Disappointed!
"
"
Holy cow the seller shipped it fast!.. Love this product for fine curly hair.. Doesn't weigh it down at all!
"
"
Disappointed in the handling/preparation of my product! Pump opened and there was product all over within the bag which means wasted product! Pump should have been taped in place to prevent opening during shipping.
"
"
I think this was made for a stiffer hair than mine.  I love Deva products, but this one just wasn't for me
"
"
Easy to apply makes my hair look and feel great. Don’t look for a less expensive alternative. Nothing is it’s equal.
"
"
This wasn't as great as I had been reading about, but I suppose it is an okay Leave in Conditioner.I will finish my bottle but will then find another leave in. I will not buy this product again.
"
"
I have been using this product for years and love it.  I am 100% a Deva girl and swear by most of their products.  I often order my products from Amazon because the prices are better and I am able to get the product in 2 days with my Prime account.  Having done this with no problems multiple times I feel bad writing a negative review however I felt the need to warn my fellow customers.  I ordered the 16oz B'leave-in (perhaps waiting a little too long because I am now out of the product) and received my package today only to find the 6oz bottle with a 16oz sticker on it.  I dont know if this was Amazon's fault or the seller's (IVANYCH) fault but either way its a terrible inconvenience.  At first I thought they were trying to charge me $33 for the small bottle which infuriated me but I soon realized that the wrong sticker was put on the bottle which makes me think they may have placed the wrong sticker on multiple bottles.  I contacted Amazon and while they immediately offered to issue me a refund, they could not re send the correct product and told me I would have to reorder the item and send back the wrong one.  While this is not a big deal, its really inconvenient for me, especially since I need the product now and thought I would have it in time and now I have to wait multiple days.  So I am writing this as a warning to those buying this product.  Its an incredible product especially when used with the one conditioner and arc angel gel, but make sure you got the proper product (for such an expensive product you should get your money's worth)
"
"
Wow!  This made such a difference in my daily styling.  I mix it with a little bit of gel.
"
"
This is item is great for curly hair
"
"
Love this product in pump size
"
"
I had recently been introduced to these products and purchased some at a local salon after a presentation by the owner of DevaCurl did a brief seminar on ""embracing your curls"". I was happy to find these products at Amazon offering competitive pricing and a wide variety of size options. This particular product is light weight, pleasant smelling (as are all the products), and works nicely for me (fine, but thick curls). I use it straight from the bottle as well as I watered it down to use from a spray bottle and am happy with both.
"
"
Love this product. It totally calms down my crazy curls.Highly recommended for call with frizzy curly hair that want ""hey you're having a great hair day"" comments from friends. :-)
"
"
Best stuff out there:)
"
"
Arrived broken and leaking.
"
"
Highly recommend!
"
"
I didn't see any difference. Tried it at different times (before and after gel) (before and after ""towel""dry).
"
"
nice.  soft.  not sticky or crunchy.  i use all the deva care products and i like this one too.  after shower, before angell.
"
"
This is a great leave in product for curls! After washing hair, lightly ""dry"" with a t-shirt or paper towel then apply B'Leave In by scrunching it into your curls a section at a time.
"
"
Makes my frizzy hair into loose curls and ringlets!
"
"
Works just as described.
"
"
Best product out there for curly hair.
"
"
I love this product. I have fine,  curly hair and this makes my hair shiny,  gives it a soft hold,  and it smells good.
"
"
I love the Deva Curl line of products and use them often on my thin curly  hair.
"
"
Love this product and how it keeps the curls in my hair!
"
"
My hairdresser recommended this product.  I do not have frizzy hair, but straight Asian hair.  My hair doesn't get ""flat"" but stays soft and styled all day.  Great stuff.
"
"
Still learning about the products.  Impressed so.far.
"
"
Love B leave in
"
"
juicy curls
"
"
Great for adding volume and for keeping my curls!  I have been using Deva Curl products for 1 1/2 years and love them.
"
"
Great product simply love it
"
"
Love it
"
"
Works great
"
"
My daughter LOVES IT.  It reduces the frizz and the curls are in their full glory
"
"
Love the Diva Curl line
"
"
Love it!
"
"
I am an avid user of this product & this is a great price!
"
"
Product is great but opened box and 1/3 of product had spilled out because lid was not tight.
"
"
Best leave-in EVER.
"
"
It came in a reasonable amount of time, and the product was what was advertised.
"
"
I love this stuff. It makes my curls manageable, soft and hydrated. My hair looks shiny after using this product.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Seemed to dry my hair out.
"
"
I love  it the best I tryed
"
"
love it make my hair so curly
"
"
Love this stuff. Leave in and defines my curls while leaving my hair soft and not crunchy.
"
"
Makes my hair flat
"
"
I vvave been using B'Leave In  for years. It took me a while to figure out how to use it optimally. So here it is... Use a dollop when your hair is just washed and is completely wet. Then dry as per usual for beautiful, shiny and defined curls
"
"
This product was not for my hair type.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Didn't really give me the result I was looking for.  It could just be my hair texture. I will not purchase this for myself again
"
"
I love this product!
"
"
Couldn't live without this product.
"
"
I have straight hair with a slight wave if I don't blow dry it. When I use this product my waves turn to curls!
"
"
Great Product! Use it often
"
"
I love the Deva Curl system! It always makes my hair look great. It works for me and just about every type of curly hair out there.
"
"
Arrived damaged. Very difficult to use without a working pump.
"
"
Fast delivery and great product
"
"
Shampoo open leak in the bag.
"
"
This is a great product but the when I got it this time, the pump was broken. Bummer
"
"
Left my curls very flaky smh.
"
"
I used to love this product. It was more of a leave in conditioner (they called it a moisture supplement) that gave my hair needed moisture without any greasiness, AND for the most part the ingredients were no cause for concern. I just reordered the product and was VERY disappointed to see that it is now called a 'curl booster and volumizer' and the ingredients read like all the other chemical laden products I was trying to get away from. I was worried this was going to happen. A respectable ingredient list always seems just out of grasp... Sigh. I still gave it a try, and it just makes my hair feel heavy, not greasy, just heavy and not moisturized at all.
"
"
This is a confusing but great product. It has the consistency of gel and serum and it says leave in in the title but I definitely use it like a gel styler because it works so well. This product defined my curls like crazy and had great shine but i can flake if you use to much or without enough leave in conditioner. This product I will definitely repurchase as a gel styler.
"
"
I LOVE IT
"
"
The shipment was quick and exactly what I was expecting! Great product!
"
"
Let me start by saying I love Deva Curl. I have long s'wavy hair, so maybe this product isn't for me. I have issues retaining my curl after my hair dries. This product didn't really work for my hair. Rather than keep my bounce, it weighted my long hair and made it feel a bit gunky. I'll stick to the No Poo and Conditioner.
"
"
This gel is great for curly hair - adds a nice little boost but is not sticky and does not leave a residue. The pump is convenient and this is a good price.
"
"
In love! I put this on before I apply eco styler gel and my wash-and-gos are always perfect
"
"
I enjoy it
"
"
Great product recommended by my daughter.  People at work commented on it at work the first day I used it.
"
"
Great Product! And the arrive time of the product was quick!😊
"
"
Smells great but product didn't work well with my hair. Felt Gummy.
"
"
I Love finished text of my hair.
"
"
This product works very well if you use it correctly. I use with the DevaCurl Set It  Up and Above... I mix it together in my palm and work it through WET hair. It works amazingly to control frizz and define the curl. It lasts all day/ night. You have to play around with it to get the correct amount... I have very thin hair so I do not need too much.  I also use the DevaCurl Low-Poo and One Condition products which make a world of a difference opposed to using commercial products.
"
"
The product is original & brand new. Packaging was well done so there was no leakage & timely arrived. I am sure I will be back for a re-order !!! Thanks !!!  :)
"
"
Great products. My hair is now so curly, and smells delicious.
"
"
I bought this for my daughter who has very curly frizzy hair and she says this is the only thing that really works for her.  Believe me she has tried several different products.
"
"
This is a great product! When my hair gets longer, its harder to maintain, but devacurl is the best leave-in I've found for my hair so far.
"
"
nope nope.............hope this says it all, the folks that posted a good review for this product must have been paid.  does not tame my curly wild hair even a little bit........very disappointed
"
"
Crazy curl definition! A little goes a long way.
"
"
I use this after shampooing  BTW, I just use a good sulfate free shampoo, not necessarily Deva.  This  by far my favorite find of all their products.  It is what really defines my curls into nice seperate and distinct strands.  I use it while my hair is soaking wet and rake it through.  Then I scrunch with a microfiber towel.  After scrunching so that there are no more drips and drops, I apply the Gel.  I don't rake it through with my fingers.  I just seal the curls that have already been defined in place. No frizzies!!
"
"
I love this product. Very light but definitely defines your curls and tames your frizz. I highly recommend this item.
"
"
I have fine dry curls and this curl booster is great for them.  It gives light hold and moisture without making my curls greasy.  I’ve tried a lot of products, but this one is the best for fine curls
"
"
This does it's job to an extent but I get flakes in my hair when I use it which I do not like.  I've tried mixing this with another leave in and it seems to help reduce the flake situation.  It's ok but I am not too sure that I will repurchase.  I'm disappointed because I enjoy most of the deva products.
"
"
I am so happy with this product,  I literally want to marry it! I have struggled a lifetime with my fine ""boticelli"" type curls, and finally have the answer! I use the devacare conditioner as a leave-in and this as my styling product. That's it, no other products needed! just gorgeous, quenched, loose/wavy curls and no frizz!
"

My new go to leave I conditioner I wasn't using one after I washed for my wash n gos but I am glad I found this product the slip it adds to my hair is wonderful and it smells great. I use the decadence line no poo and conditioner then I add super cream then b leave in and the glaze my hair with eco Aragon oil styling gel it gives me the most defined curls I tried the arc angel hair gel but it doesn't give me the hold I like but I can get 3-4 days out of my wash n go before I need to wash again. Love the devacurl product on my 4c hair pricy but worth the money

Product arrived late and broken

Once you know how to properly use this product you'll be in love.  My stylist taught me how to use it on damp hair using a microfiber cloth. First scrunch it in, then use the microfiber cloth to scrunch.  It leaves lovely ringlets or body without being stiff.  Within minutes you can touch up your style with a curling or flat iron if needed.

Awesome loved it

I always have two of these bottles going, one in the shower and one at the vanity.  It does wonders to control my curls!!

Best leave in conditioner I've ever used
"
"
This product is amazing on my naturally curly hair, I can really tell a difference when I run out!  Seems expensive but a little goes a long way!  I have shoulder length hair and use about a quarter sized amount. My stylist told me to apply a small amount in the shower while my hair was still drenched, then scrunch it through from roots to ends using the water in your hair to help distribute.  Works great like that, before I was using when I got out of the shower and it was too heavy for my curls and I ended up with crunchy hair.  I have tried the entire Deva Curl line and found it eventually left my hair dull with a lot of build up....but I've stuck with this for about 2 years now and found nothing comparable to give you soft bouncy curls that feel product free!
"
"
perfect for my 3c/4a curls
"
"
Very drying..
"
"
My favorite gel! It gives my curls awesome definition without making my hair crunchy. It smells great and if I apply it before I get out of the shower, per the DevaCurl Method, it makes my curls much tighter. It can be reactivated the next day by dampening my hair and scrunching. I have used it when flat-ironing my hair, and it gives light-weight control to whatever style I pick for the day.
"
"
Love this stuff!
"
"
I use this quite often. I know it says to leave on, but I do rinse some of it off because it makes your hair a bit more stiff.
"
"
Liked it, but for my hair (I won't speak for my whole hair type), it just wasn't the best product. However, my sister-in-law loves it!
"
"
I wish people would mentioned the amount of white residue this product leaves on your hair... :/ not happyI basically paid $23 for a bad gel...
"
"
I like the Deva deep conditioner so I bought two  of these thinking I would love it too.  For the life of me I couldn't figure out what is flaking on my hair until I stopped using it.  Now I m stuck with 1 2/3 bottle of this expensive product.
"
"
GREAT PRODUCT!!! ARRIVED FAST!!!
"
"
Definitely has to be used with another deva curl product, having issues with the leave in still leaving my hair frizzy. Would use with the foam and it will be perfect.
"
"
I have always purchased my deva curl products at the salon.  I have used B'leave in for years and it has been terrific. When I purchased it online, it isn't at all the same as the same product in the salon.  It is watery and does not condition as well as the salon bought product. This is very disappointing.
"
"
This line of product came highly recommended from a friend, and I have to say, I'm very disappointed.  Maybe I'm just used to using natural hair products, but they all smell and feel too 'chemically' to me.  I thought the product line was supposed to provide extra moisture for your curls.  My hair has never been so dry.  Now I need to go get all my freshly-split ends cut off, and I'm trying to grow out my hair!  I'm going back to my old products and giving these to my friend.  Money wasted.
"
"
Great seller, great product
"
"
I am very pleased with the product and with the Seller.I regret not getting more at the time of purchase and if the Seller sees this, perhaps they would consider allowing me more of the same.p.s., how can I contact the Seller?Thank you.

Hello, so I recently went to the Devachan Salon for a cut.  I was asking the apprentice questions as she washed and prepared my hair with product about the B'leave in.  She explained to me that B'leave in is not a leave in conditioner even though it does soften the hair and add luster because it doesn't really moisturize.  Nor is this product a gel even though it has that consistency because it doesn't offer hold.  It is best considered a hair primer.  Just like a makeup primer it goes on after your moisturizer and before you styling product.  It provides a base for your gel to adhere to extending the results to your textured hair. On me she put deva one conditioner as a leave in for my hair then B'leave in and lastly Ultra defining gel.  I went under a dryer and then the stylist scrunched my hair to remove the cast.  My wavy/curly hair was amazing and the definition and shine lasted to day five!  Love the product now that I understand what it is and how to use it.
"
"
I've read all the reviews, good and bad, for B'Leave In.  Actually, all of them are correct.  When I first tried the product, I hated it.  It didn't seem to do a thing for my hair, and my hair felt dry and dirty.  I then read the book written by the line's creator (very good, by the way), and realized I hadn't been using it correctly.You need to use a LOT of this product, and you need to use it on wet (not damp) hair.  You apply at least a quarter-sized glob to the underside of the hair at the back of your head.  Then do the same for the outerside of the back, the sides, and the front/top.  Those amounts are approximate based on my short, very thick, very dry hair.Once I started using the correct amount, the improvement in my hair was dramatic.  It took care of my intense frizz, while leaving the curl looking beautiful.With all products for curly hair, you need to experiment to find the ones that work best for you.  All I can say is that I love B'Leave In, and love what it does for my very thick, very coarse hair.
"
"
IF DEVA CAN GET RID OF THE WHITE FLAKE PROBLEM THAT COVERS MY ENTIRE HEAD WHEN I USE THIS this product would be heaven sent! I absolutely LOVE how my curls look and feel MINUS the white stuff.
"
"
When I moved to Utah several years ago from humid Texas, I was dismayed to find my bouncy curls turn to straight straw.  Who knew I had such sparse hair???  B'Leave-In has restored the curl and really does make my hair look fuller.  Love this stuff.
"
"
I really like the product.  There is an immediate difference in the feel of the hair and definition of the curls.
"
"
This is the only leave-in conditioner that I use on my hair.  I have tried many brands and paid a lot of money for the really expensive varieties only to be disappointed and out of money.  Deva Curl products are the only products that work for my hair leaving curls defined and soft.  Plus, it's one of the lesser expensive but high end hair product I've found and have been so satisfied with.  I also recommend the conditioning cleanser and the conditioner.  So far, the prices I've found on Amazon.com for the larger version of this product is better than the beauty supply stores and salons I go to purchase this product.
"
"
I like how it moisturizers and defines. I use it with Shea butter and Eco styler and usually gets great results.
"
"
I have very long, fine hair with type 3A curls. The first time I used this, I used it like a normal gel or styling cream (I used probably about a nickel-quarter sized amount) without any other styling products. This product definitely does add boost, volume, and shine to curls but does not act as a clumping agent and doesn't have much hold on its own. I ended up with overall more separated curls that had volume but looked very limp the second day after washing. I now use this product in combination with Tigi's ""On the Rebound"" curl recall cream and it is absolutely amazing. This combination of products has given me the results I have been looking for with my curls for years. I first apply a generous amount of the curl cream and distribute just a small drop of B'Leave In evenly throughout my hair, and I end up with amazing, perfectly formed, volumized curls that hold their shape for 2-3 days. While I personally wouldn't use this product alone for my type of curls, I couldn't recommend it more when it is used in small amounts in combination with a styling cream.
"
"
I really like this stuff but think it’s  expensive for 16oz which I can use up quickly. I might be able to get a better price with a larger size but haven’t found one. In order to make this size last, I pour some of it into a clear spray bottle and mix it with water (say, 1 part conditioner to 3 parts water). I spritz it on my hair while still soaking wet and gently pat it dry with a Deva towel. It really takes away the frizz while not making my hair crunchy or flaky. (I have tight curls and lots of frizz.) Since I found this solution, “B-leave In” has become one of my favorite Deva Curl products, especially since I get more bang for my buck as well.
"
"
I have loved all of the other Diva Curl products I've tried, but this one was a waste. My hair dresser used this product in addition to the Coconut Crème product and I loved how my hair turned out. I bought this and used it without the coconut product, and it was a total disaster. This product made my hair super frizzy, and felt greasy too. Apparently it's only good if you mix it with something else (at least on my hair). I would have bought a trial size, but couldn't find it, so just went for it in the big bottle, and that was a mistake.
"
"
It works to hold my hair in place without feeling heavy or crunchy, but I get more wave than curl. My hair does it's own thing - sometimes curly, sometimes wavy, sometimes frizzy - but this product makes it barely wavy. Not what I was going for, but I generally let my hair do what it wants. We get along better that way.
"
"
Poor packaging by amazon. Poor bottles by manufacturer.
"
"
I have very frizzy 3b curly hair, and this works great! I prefer my hair with lots of big volume with as little frizz as possible. B'Leave In helps with both, and when I use it with a few other smoothing/frizz control products, I've been able to get an extra day out of my hair before I have to wash and restyle! It's definitely not a product I personally can use to wash and go, but that's almost impossible to find with my hair. I definitely recommend it!
"
"
I was a little skeptical ordering devacurl on amazon simply because I heard a lot of people saying to just watch out because these sellers can be filling the product with something else or might be a duplicate of the brand, but everything worked out great it is the actual brand and I love devacurl products in general I like to mix this with the one decadence condition in the shower to style it while my hair is wet and also to avoid making a mess outside with the hair products.
"
"
YES!  I have fine, thinning curly hair (wouldn't be my choice, but you have to play the hand you're dealt!).  After I use the No-Poo and the One Conditioner, this is the product I use next.  It gives my hair wonderful body and helps control the frizz.  Without it my hair would be an out-of-control frizzy mess  :)
"
"
I don’t think this is the real product. Has not done what it normally does to my curls and it leaves a dry film in my hair, like they watered it down with hair gel.
"
"
I've been using Deva products for about 5 years. I use B'Leave along with Deva Curl's Light Defining Gel. My curls drink this stuff up.  It has a light clean scent and works through my hair easily. My hair always looks great; soft defined curls and no frizz. Never crunchy, just lovely shiny curls. What more could a curly girl ask for?
"
"
This product has worked very well in my thick, naturally curly hair. The pump is easy to use and it's not sticky or make my hair stiff. It does help keep the curl contained and under control!
"
"
Other reviews mentioned this product produces flakes in hair, that looks like dandruff...well is true. The way this didn't happen was with the use of it with the gel, which i only use with special occasions since it causes a lot of knots in my hair and eventually a frizzy puff. I'm getting to be disappointed with this whole Deva line....
"
"
This is a light weight, non-sticky gel with little build-up.  It does impart some shine and I love the pump bottle.  I just wish it controlled the frizz better so I wouldn't have to use another product with it.
"
"
this is my favorite DevaCurl product, hands down.  It is the only one I always have on hand - the first layer before I use anything else!  I have wavy/curly spirals and they are SO fussy.  The gives them a soft cohesiveness, a little moisture and heft without being too heavy.  Love it.  Have started many other people on this product.
"
"
works great as a Volumizer and for frizz control....don't be fooled by the name it's not a conditioner and I knew that when I purchased it as a recomendation from a stylist.  I started with this a few years ago and now I use all Deva products for my curls.  It made a remarkable change in my curls....especially the Devacare no poo shampoo.  I use the Devacare one condition and the light defining gel as well.
"
"
Love my curls since I started using this! And the large(r) pump bottle is more economical than the smaller bottle I bought to try it out.
"
"
It smells nice and I love the curls it gives me BUT i must say i get these white flaky stuff like cheap gel does. Im switching to something else because of that.
"
"
The product is great. The packing wasn’t. It spilled about a 1/4 of it in the box.
"
"
this products is great it holds my curlstogether and doesn’t make it hard but i don’t like how it leaves like white stuff on my hair the next day
"
"
Light weight and not too sticky.  It gently holds  my curls  without being sticky or crunchy, and leaves them shiny with great color.  Not a dull coating on them.  I keep trying to find that perfect product for my curls, but I already have it.
"
"
Don't know what to say other than after waiting for a fair amount of time THIS is not what I was expecting. Especially not at that price.
"
"
The other comments are correct---this does dry flaky.  I had showers of flakes flying off my clean hair the first time I used it.  Now I just use very little, about 1-3 pumps, more as a finishing shield, and it is fine. It is lighter than the Deva gel and the definition is not as hard and tight.
"
"
The pump mechanism is busted and will not work. Leaks everywhere.  Seems as if it was taped down already busted.  Not happy.  Please send a replacement pump.
"
"
The absolute best product for giving me the curls I want.  Touchably soft, bouncy curls without that ""crunchy"" feel some products give.
"
"
I've been using this product for about half a year consistently and find my hair is breaking more often despite the soft curls DevaCurl gives me. I think the gel has been drying out my curls over time as well as making it coarse. Went back to Kinky Curly (knot today & curling custard) and my hair feels more moisturized.
"
"
I love the Deva Curl products.  This is the first time I've tried the B'Leave-in and I love it!  I just wish the Deva Curl products weren't so expensive.
"
"
This is the linchpin of my Curly Girl regimen as it provides the necessary moisture and shine that enables the curls to bounce and look all-around healthy and happy. I use it regularly between shampoos following the Mist-er Right to revitalize the luster in my locks.  I depend on it so much that I buy it in pairs.
"
"
A few pumps after I wash my hair and I am out the door. When my hair dries, I have soft, easy, natural curls. Combine with a gel to keep your curls in order for a few days. My natural curls fall out by day 2 if I don't use gel. Before this product all I had was frizz.
"
"
Excellent leave-in to fluff up my curls
"
"
These Deva products are so fantastic for Curly hair.  I am 53 & used many products to get my hair looking healthy & controlled & this product Works awesome.  The pricing is also amazing since anywhere you look they start at about $20.  I look forward to continuing to receive the many compliments of how much better my hair looks, Thank You!!!  ~Rev Jacqui
"
"
I've been using B Leave-In conditioner for over a year now and it's a great product.  I put it on while in the shower while my hair is sopping wet and I've found that works best for me.  My stylist consistently remarks on how much healthier my hair is and I attribute that to switching over to Deva Curl products.  My general routine is to use No-Poo, followed by a quick condition with One Condition.  I rinse that out, then apply B Leave-in.  Once out of the shower, I use Ultra-light gel.  I've recently started occasionally using Deva Curl Volumizing Foam and SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler.  This combination has allowed my natural curl to come back along with a pretty shine.
"
"
in love love love!!! holds my curl and adds shine to my frizzy hair
"
"
For my hair, it wasn't so good. My hair is really dry and it worsened with this product. I use other Deva's products, and I prefer them. I use the super cream (coconut hair styler) and the ultra defining gel, as well as the no poo and conditioner. I really recommend the super cream and the ultra defining gel.
"
"
I have fine hair (in my 40's) however in my teens/twenties/thirties it was thick and very wavy.  This product brings out the natural wave I had, even now that my hair has changed.  It doesn't weigh my finer hair down either.  My daughter has the long THICK ringlet type hair and also LOVES all the DevaCurl products.  I highly recommend this product line all the way around.
"
"
Love this product. Shipped well.
"
"
One of my favorite products in the Deva Curl line. Smells lovely, and preserves my delicate waves and curls without weighing them down.
"
"
This stuff is fab for curlz. Love it in conjunction with the light defining gel. Best when scrunched in on wet hair. Very light weight and effective
"
"
excellent
"
"
great leave in!
"
"
Love all Deva Curl products, but B'Leave In Curl Boost and Volumizer is one of my all time favorites! This does wonders for my naturally curly hair!
"
"
This product really didn't do anything for me.  My hair looked the exactly the same after using it - no curlier - no more volumized. It was disappointing, because I thought this would be the thing that would give my 2A/2B waves more definition.  I did like the smell - kind of a ""clean"" scent.
"
"
My daughter love this for her curly hair
"
"
All of deva curl products are healthy for natural curly hair and provides quick hair styling. Good choice for black American women and men and any one that wants  a natural look that is clean defined curls that  is bouncy and beautiful give it a try contact me for use and application on hair.
"
"
Heard about this product and heard some good things so I thought I would give it a try. Soooooo disappointed. It is very drying to my hair and feels like it offers no moisture. From experience I know not one products works for everyone but being a leave in conditioner I didn't expect for my hair to feel so dry even if it didn't define my curls the way I would've liked. And I am really not a fan of how it smells. Sure wish I could return it because I feel like I just threw away my money. I was looking for a pepduct to change up my routine a bit but i guess I will just stick with my Mixed Chicks that always works great for me.
"
"
Its Ok, I cant really tell the difference when I have this in my hair and when I dont
"
"
I love the product, but when i received the item the pump spout was broken! While I can still use the product, it is frustrating to have to take the spout off every time to use it.
"
"
I went CG about 8 months ago, and I have been using Devacurl products almost exclusively.  I have tried their mousse, gel, and this is the best leave in styling product that I have used.  I have very find delicate cherub curls, and the gel makes my hair too stringy, while the foam doesn't seem to give my hair enough hold.  I put a nickels worth of this on my hair, and my curls love it.  It works as well as silicone products on my hair, but without the buildup.  This is a great product for people with fine or delicate curls.  I am very pleased with this :)
"
"
HEAVEN IN A BOTTLE! I TRY OTHER PRODUCTS BUT THIS IS MY GO TO! GREAT FOR CURLS!
"
"
I have a fair amount of short, fine textured curly hair.  I used to use a combo of products to get the curls to remain frizz free and defined until I switched hairstylists and she used the B-leave in on my hair when cutting it the first time....and this was all she used.  I was amazed at how well it worked.  She didn't sell it in the salon at that point ( had run out) so I searched and found it on Amazon and thought it was pricey to start with, but ordered it anyway...I dont' normally buy salon products, but found out that the 16 oz size ( comes in a pump, not tube) lasts me almost 4 months for my short- medium hair.  You do need to use a lot for it to work well...I use 2 full pumps on my wet hair and 1 more small pump to finish it once dried w/ a diffuser. Most of the time I use nothing else other than hairspray.  If I want more of a shiny, crunchy look, then I may also apply just a quarter size amount of mousse but that's only on wet rainy days when I want extra protection.  Keep in mind this is NOT a a leave in conditioner, it's a styling product.
"
"
i love the deva nopoo and conditioner and have used arc anGel for years but this is an even better product.  stays in soft, not stiff, volumizes and leaves hair super soft and pretty
"
"
Leaves a white film on hair once dry.
"
"
I am so disappointed. I received the package in a timely fashion, which was good, yet when it arrived, I noticed the pump does not work! That's the whole point of ordering a 16oz bottle!
"
"
I am the biggest fan ever of Deva Curl products!!!! I love this gel .....  it's not heavy, and doesn't weigh my curls down. In fact, it adds volume to my curls!!! I love the texture and smell too!!!
"
"
I didn't realize that it was mainly a volumizer.  I thought it was a leave in conditioner. I have extremely thick hair, so I will not be able to use this product in the hot, humid summers of DC.  But I plan to use it this winter
"
"
I've been using this product for a few years.  My hair is curly but fine so I use this as a post-shampoo conditioner.  It's light but provides good definition and hold.
"
"
Love all DEVA products:)  Not had a bad experience yet:)
"
"
This gives me the best definition that I have ever had
"
"
I've been using Deva products for nearly three years now, and it took me a move across the country and finding another stylist to be introduced to this product.  It works wonders on my fine, curly hair.  I mix about 4 parts of this product with one part of the AnGel product, then slather it on.  Using this product alone does not give my curls enough staying power, I need the firmness of the AnGel gel too in order for them to keep their shape and not get frizzy.  I'd recommend curly girls with fine hair give this a try.  Experiment a bit with mixing it with other products, and the amount you use.  I will definitely be buying this again.
"
"
I have fine thick curly hair and I have even used this alone and it really helps tame my flyaway hair without weighing it down. I love the smell and I have used it with and without the gel.
"
"
I used too much the first two times.  My hair is above shoulder length, fine and thin.  One pump is all that I need.  Anyone tying this for the first time might want to start out using as small amount as they can and  then check results and adjust for the next shower/application.  Too much of this product left my hair  crisp and hard...even when  scrunching repeatedly after it was dry.  It's my early experience with the Devacurl line and I'm still on the fence about some of the other products.  This one  acts a lot like a gel I used to get by Revlon that was 8L in holding strength (which they stopped making  about 10 years ago).  I'm glad to fine a close replacement.
"
"
Does a good job of boosting fine hair, but does nothing to moisturize or hold hair like gel and mousse will. Great if used with a hair gel.
"
"
This is a great alternative to mousse lady's!
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Love the product, although pricey.
"
"
Great Product, Highly Recommended.
"
"
Awesome product, keeps my hair curly and in place!!
"
"
Love this! Curls popping!
"
"
I like the Deva Curl products, but I didn't experience this one to work better than the gels, etc.
"
"
it's okay not what I was looking for
"
"
I love this volumizer and it leaves my hair soft with firm curls and tons of volume.
"
"
I've been using this product for years and this was a good price.
"
"
This is a great addition to the Deva line and step.  I typically use this if I'm showering and going to bed (read: not going anywhere after a shower).  It just gives a little shine, bounce and step.  I don't use it daily - but a great curl enhancer when you aren't really looking to ""do"" your hair, but yet, want it curly! Smells great.Also, for those quick mornings I don't have time to do the whole Deva process (read: I slept in...again), it works like a very light gel.  Yet, conditions.
"
"
i use all the deva products, this one made my hair too, soft.  actually took the curl out.  as i have aged my hair has softened.  if you have tight curl and friz this would probably work well.  also, in a very humid environment it will work also.
"
"
I bought this for my very dry course hair. I tried adding it at the end of my hair regime but it makes the hair courser and frizzier.
"
"
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT
"
"
These Deva products will change your life if you have curly hair. Stop fighting your hair!
"
"
Yes it works, my hair looks better than ever and not like I have any product in it at all.
"
"
This product certainly makes my curls soft and more pronounced. I'm ordering more today! For me, it's a 5 star product.
"
"
I use this after the Deva Curl Condition One and it helps my curls revitalize and look really really great.
"
"
This product made my hair crispy although it says no alcohol.
"
"
These are fabulous!  The DevaCurl changed my hair!!
"
"
Good product...good price
"
"
Loved it.  Just wish Amazon had this product available for auto delivery.
"
"
These are the best for curly hair!!!
"
"
wasn't impressed kind of gummy
"
"
This product is amazing for curly, fine hair (mixed girl).Arrived in a flash -completely satisfiedUse with Deva Curl No-Poo :)
"
"
I love this product.  I have spent so much money on hair products in the past, and finally I have found the RIGHT product for my hair.  Smells great too! Just make sure you use it sparely.  It goes fast!
"
"
same quality product as all other deva products
"
"
I love the Deva line and using this before the gel works wonders.
"
"
This is just one of the DevaCurl products I use to get that tamed, yet natural curl look going.  I get lots of compliments on my hair now that I use the DevaCurl products.
"
"
This stuff is so great 🔑😭🙏🏽
"
"
This brand does not work as well for my hair as the other gel, light or ultra. This also has a different smell, reminiscent of baby aspirin.The delivery and price was, however, as promised.
"
"
If you are in the market for great hair products for curly hair, go for the Deva line!  I haven't looked this good since I decided to go ""natural""!
"
"
One of the few curly girl DevaCurl products I'm not a fan of. I absolutely love almost all of the other DevaCurl products. This one is superfluous if you have some of the other DevaCurl items, such as the ultra defining gel, SuperCream, Set it Free and Mister Right. Not sure where Deva B'Leave In Curl Boost and Volumizer fits in.
"
"
love it.
"
"
I love the way it holds my curl in and how my hair feels, when I use this product. My hair can get a little wild at times and it helps to keep it under control.
"
"
I LOVE DevaCurl.  Me and my hair are addicted to the products!  I have been using Deva for a little over a year and highly recommend ALL curly girls to make the change to DEVA!  LOVE IT!
"
"
Good product!!! I love it❤️
"
"
The shipping and product is amazing! I recommend this brand DevaCurl to any other curly hair beauty! This product is like a light weight serum/gloss/ leave in these 3 things had a baby and it's the deva curl B'leave in! It doesn't necessarily boost cues but it makes them look vibrant, moisturized and defined ❤️
"
"
Excellent for my curly hair!
"
"
Love this product! My hair is wavy and prone to frizz. Apply this product on really wet hair, scrunch and allow to air dry. Hair comes out SOFT, with waviness enhanced, and frizz free. Once dry the product is so light weight, you can't even tell there is product in your hair. I live in Florida, so frizz was a fact of life until I found this product. Buy it now.
"
"
Super, delivery in France very fast, very good product
"
"
I'm not exactly sure what type of hair I have. I think I have 2c hair. My hair is long, almost down to my bra strap.I first use the Devacurl Low-poo.... then I condition with Suave naturals coconut, then I use devacurl One condition. I rake it through my hair, and scrunch my hair all over. After leaving it on for 5-10 mins, I rinse it out by scrunching my hair upside down under the water. with my head still upstide down, I scrunch a few more times, to get some excess water out of my hair, but I still want my hair full of water. Then I apply the Devacurl B'Leave In.I apply it to soaking wet hair. I also put about a quarters worth to one side of my head, raking it through, and scrunching.... and then put another quarters worth to the other side... Raking and then scrunch several times. then tilt head to the left and scrunch and then to the right and scrunch and then upside down again and Scrunch!  Then I follow with Devacurl Arc Angel. Only scrunch another few times, after apply the Arc Angel or it could cause frizz. Then I immediately Plop for 5-6 mins. That's all my hair can handle.  Take out the plop and immediately diffuse. But I diffuse, very slowly and Very carely. I usually use high heat. I diffuse with my hair upside down for 5 mins - and then tilt head to the left and diffuse for 4-5 mins - and to the right, and diffuse..... then flip your head upside down again. Keep repeating the process til you have awesome Curls!! I have recently heard of a technique that I tried last week and I really like.Apply the B'Leave in in the shower with wet hair, Then Plop, then diffuse till hair is 50% dry, Then apply your Arc Angel gel or whatever gel you like... and continue to diffuse. My hair seemed fuller. I have only tried that one time, but loved it. Will try again this week.The B'Leave in is a wonderful product, you may have to play around with and find what works for you. I really do love this product along with the other Devacurl products. I bought the 16oz size, for around $21.00. That has been the cheapest price I have seen.

Their entire product line is amazing.  My hair has never looked better.  I love this product.  It really brings out the curl.

Love it!  Works better on my thin wavy curls than the Light Gel.  I use it with a little bit of the Heaven In Hair moisture treatment (used as a styling cream not a moisture treatment), and my curls turn out great.  My hair isn't weighed down at all and I have great curls for days.  When I want to refresh my curls for day 2 (and even sometimes day 3!) I mix this product with a little bit of the Heaven In Hair and water in a spray bottle.  I spray my hair all over then flip my head and use the diffuser on a low setting so set the curls again.  Works like a dream!

I have fine curly to wavy hair. I also have Celiac disease. I was disappointed to find this product has wheat protein in it which helps my hair to fall out and I also disliked the smell of product.  It did not add volume to my hair....I felt I was careful on the amount of product I used but it left my hair looking stiff and greasy.

I've been following the Curly Girl method (see Curly Girl: The Handbook for over a year, but I started out by using smaller, boutique lines before trying Deva products.  When I started getting Deva cuts last year, I started incorporating their products into my regimen -- and B'Leave In is one of my favorites in the line!My Deva stylist first suggested this for my fine, wavy hair, and it adds volume and lots of curl to my locks.  The trick, as another reviewer mentioned, is to use this on really wet, saturated hair; I have hair that's about five inches past my shoulders, and I use about three pumps all over, really scrunching it into my hair.  I then apply a lot of AnGel, clip my roots, and dry my hair.  I get nice, soft waves with a lot of definition and fullness.Great product that's worth a try if you have a similar hair type!
"

Love the product - helps my hair be curly without being crunchy!  only problem is it sometimes causes flakes in hair.
"
"
The product is great however I just got my new bottle , it arrived damaged and leaked all over ...
"
"
Terrible.  Flakes and make it looks like dandruff all over your hair - don't buy.
"

wonderful product.

I'm writing a quick review because I'm seeing some misconceptions in other reviews. I've been using this product for about 8 months. Despite the name, this is NOT a leave-in conditioner. It's a voluminizer. It's not a gel. It's a curl & volume booster than you put on under your gel or styling products. It has protein in it. So don't use if your hair doesn't like protein.For me, this is a holy grail product. I use it every time I wash. I also use it for 2nd day hair mixed with water and One Condition. I have fine, high porosity,  2b-3a curls. My hair loves protein! I keep the bottle of this stuff in my shower and rake/scrunch it in right after I rinse my conditioner. Then I plop my hair for about 2 minutes and follow up with Arc Angel before diffusing. This product gives me volume and bouncy curls on top. It doesn't have much (if any) frizz control. You need a good gel or styling product if you get frizz. I use about a quarter size of this stuff and my hair is bra strap length.Hope this review helps!

Hi I have been using this product for the first time after reading the reviews and this produts works really for my 3c 4a hair, First I have boiughtthe one conditionner and this was amazing on my  hair as a leave in so I decided to buy the B'Leave in to use it as a styler ans both together my hair is amazing ! love it !! I received many compliments it gave me shiny, healthy and  really defined curly Hair ( I have thick hair )  LOVE MY CURLS
"
"
Deva Products are all I use in my naturally curly hair. This is the first I tried this and I really like it!
"
"
As with all devacurl products I'm in love. These products changed how I styled my hair completely. It's ridiculously better now. Much healthier. I use the one condition and Arc AnGEL with this.

Good Stuff

Makes curls chunkier!

Love all Deva products!!

I have heard in the past that some people have issues when buying shampoo and conditioner on Amazon because it is not the same product usually found in stores. I've never had that happen, until now. I've used DevaCurl for at least two years now, and regularly purchase it at Sephora. This shampoo and conditioner smells nothing, and I mean nothing, like the exact same DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner I've purchased in the past. When my package arrived, I still had some DevaCurl conditioner remaining from my last bottle, and when smelled side-by-side, the purchase from Amazon smells like a toxic, chemical compound, meanwhile the same exact shampoo from Sephora smells fruity and citrusy. I gave the Amazon product a shot anyways, and my scalp actually felt like it was burning and itching, and I had to wash it out with my boyfriend's shampoo. Buyers beware, I will be ordering from Sephora in the future.

I received the small travel size versions of these as a gift. I was extremely enthusiastic about the prospect of taming my curls and even went to get a professional ""Deva Curl Cut"" at a local salon. My hair has been slightly bouncier after using these products in conjuction with the Arch Angel gel (as recommended by my hair dresser), however, I have not been entirely happy with these larger sized formulas. For whatever reason, my hair began to fall out in an alarmingly obvious amount after the very first use of this product. I actually had an anxiety attack and cried when I noticed my hair would not stop coming out during the shower. I waited a few days and showered again using these products and although not as much hair came out, I have noticed that my hair since using Deva Curl (travel size and this product) has resulted in my hair feeling extremely thin. When I quickly throw my hair into a pony tail I have such obvious ""bald spots"" and I find my hair is not as full or thick as it was. I am not entirely sure it is worth the money and might switch to another no-poo alternative.

Having my first good hair day in weeks...because I gave up on this product and went back to something else. Suspect the product may have been cut with something else, expired, or just plain fake. Did not arrive with any type of factory seal, just bit of saran wrap over the lid. The no-poo shampoo wasn't too bad, but did make my scalp itchy after the first day. It did leave my hair fairly soft and clean feeling...unforunately the conditioner left my hair feeling like straw, super dry and snarled, like I'd just used a high sulfate shampoo on it instead of conditioner. When I tried to style my hair it was crazy levels of frizzy and seemed to have trouble holding onto any type of curl.My hair is a mix of 3a and 3b curls, its big and long, but not super thick and I usually only shampoo/condition it once every 5-7 days. In between I thoroughly rewet it, rinse out most of the old styling product and add back in leave-in-conditioner and curl cream. I also usually sleep and hang out with it up in a loose bun which helps retain a lot of curl and body between styling so taking it down and fluffing it a bit still looks great. But with this product my scalp was uncomfortably itchy, my hair was far too dry, and curls too flat for this. I gave it the benefit of the doubt because the day I wash and condition my hair isn't usually its prettiest. But going back to some older products has shown me just how much of a negative difference this stuff made. Hair is still dryer than it was before I tried this stuff but at least my curls are back and the frizz is minimal.I'd like to think that this isn't Deva Curl's fault, just a fake product, as I've read all the glowing ""this stuff saved my hair"" reviews and have heard good things about this line from the curly girls I know. Was so excited to try it for myself but was amazed at how awful it made my hair look and feel. This is the second time I've purchased a fake hair product from Amazon and as much as I'd like to think that reviews like this will inspire them toward better quality control, at this point I'd say don't buy anything cosmetic here unless you already have some of the same product to compare it. Then at least you can send it back right away without damaging yourself.

This is a game changer for curly hair. Since switching to DevaCurl, my hair is healthier, bouncier, and no longer needs any product post-washing to keep the frizzies at bay. If you have naturally curly hair and don't want to deal with it, this is the shampoo and conditioner for you. I wash my hair 3 times a week and just let it air dry. The end result is soft, flowing curls that required no extra time in the bathroom to make look good.
"
"
Ok I have never written a product review before. Ever.  I have curly to wavy hair.  I have used biolage and Aveda products in the past and both have left my hair feeling simultaneously dry and heavy.  I think this is due to 1) the sulfates stripping away the natural oil produced by my scalp and 2) the paraben (wax) weighed down and straightened my curls.  I even tried to quit using shampoo altogether (gross, I know) but this left my hair greasy, and my scalp dry (dandruff).  I tried Devacurl low-poo and conditioner.  It's amazing.  My hair is clean but not dry and not weighed down....so my curls are amazing.
"
"
I've been using this product for many years since I read a book called ""Curly Girl.""  This book suggests staying completely away from shampoos containing any kind of Sodium Laureth Sulfate (often called by similar names but still bad.)  That ingredient is what causes the foaming lather we think is luxurious but that lather strips away natural oils from hair and leaves it frizzy and unmanageable.  I can always tell if I use something else = friz, dry and unmanageable!  The other really IMPORTANT thing I learned from the book is always use cool water to wash and rinse curly hair.  Using hot water can open the hair shaft and release more natural oils from your hair.  This is the ONLY product I have ever found that does NOT contain any form of Sodium Laureth Sulfate.  I love it and cannot live without it.  It seems a little pricey but you don't have to use a lot and besides...how does frizzy dry hair make you feel?  Nuff said!
"
"
Wow. I have no words for how amazing this is for my curly hair. Never EVER going back. Deva curl user for life. I used the no poo and the one C onditoner followed by the light gel. Best hair product I have ever come across. 5 stars. If you have curly hair order this, no doubt will change your life like it did for mine. I watched a deva curl videos for how to do it and the girls come out perfect every time. Ordering large size right now!!!!!!!!!!!! Totally brought my curls back to live and thriving and shiny and soft. Just Wow!
"

I have been trying to switch over to healthier products and these were on my list to try.  I have oily hair that goes past my bra and I try to limit my shampooing to twice or three times a week.  Not possible with this.  I know there is a period of time where the oil will get worse before it got better but it never got better.  Honestly, it's like using conditioner two times instead of shampoo AND conditioner.  I am now trying to use them up and will not be repurchasing them again.Something that has done WONDERS for my hair:  I use head and shoulders on my scalp only then follow it with the deva curl shampoo all over my hair.  I then use the deva curl  conditioner only on the bottom half of my hair.  The next day my hair is EXTREMELY VOLUMINOUS and SOFT!!!
"

OK I have combo 3c, 4a,  4b hair that is extremely dry. I've tried every product under the sun to moisturize and define my curls. Some products worked better than others but nothing worked great. Then I heard about Deva Curls and saw all the rave reviews so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the  decadence no poo and conditioner  and heaven In hair deep conditioner. I had seen where some people leave in the conditioner, some wash it all the way out and some leave in a little.  So,  after washing with the no poo (which my hair loved)  I conditioned and washed out all but a little. Next I went on to deep condition with the heaven in hair. I had also read where some leave it in, some wash  it out  and some leave in a little.  I  didnt wash any out.  I  didn't notice any difference in my hair,  I got the same lackluster results as when I used other products so I was pretty disappointed. A few days later I decided  to give it another  try after watching a few videos and reading more reviews.  This time I used the no poo, the conditioner ( which I let sit for a few minutes)  and then COMPLETELY washed out.  I could immediately feel the difference my curls were literally forming/defining before my eyes.  I then put in the heaven in hair,  placed my hair under a cap,  wrapped a warm towel around it,  let  sit for an hour,  then I rinsed it out completely.  Wow,  is all I can say.  My curls have never been this nourished and defined!!

I typically buy Deva Curl products from my hairdresser. Since we just had a baby I wasn’t able to make it out to my salon in time to replenish my shampoo and conditioner so I bought it here. I don’t know if I received an old product or if it’s not the actual product?? ....but both the shampoo and conditioner do not smell like products I have used previously from my salon even though it claims to be the same thing. The products I received smell like old unscented lotion. Very disappointed and I will not buy again.

Ordered this as a suggestion for a friend.  I'm rather pleased with it.  I'm mixed and regular shampoo/conditioner just leaves my hair frizzy and uncontrollable. This makes my hair easy to comb and they settle perfectly!  The no poo doesn't lather and its weird to get used to in the beginning but goddess cleans very nicely, and the conditioner smells a little like dog wash but overall i love it and would recommend.
"
"
I purchased this after learning of this companies' excellent quality and dedication to hair care without the harmful chemicals. I absolutely love this product. Excellent packaging and smells great! However, I highly recommend taking DevaCurl's Curl Quiz before purchasing. DevaCurl Low-Poo is designed for curly hair, which tends to require more moisture than wavy hair (like mine!). While I love using this product on my hair, I know the Low-Poo Delight would suit my hair better as it provides weightless moisture which is what my hair really needs. Also after reading more about the product on their website I cannot stress enough the importance of massaging the shampoo into the scalp to properly clean! Massaging is also important to properly remove the shampoo while rinsing.Overall great product that I would purchase again!
"
"
I was skeptical at first about the product...I had to do a lot of researching before going with it, but I'm so glad I did! My hair is so curly and full of volume and NOTHING seems to work for it, but then I stumbled onto this gem of a line of products and im soooo IN LOVE with all of it!!
"
"
I got this originally as a sample in a much smaller size as a sample ans paid this much so the price alone is AMAZING!!!I was nervous because some other reviews said they received fake product when they ordered from amazon, but tgis is the real deal. I have been using heat to straighten and/or curl my hair for years so my natural curls were not so happy... but to my surprise after the first wash I had some nice body & curl showing & it has just continued to improve from there. If you are on the fence about this GO FOR IT it is 110% worth it!
"
"
Like some of deva curls products but feel they are way to over priced for the amount you get. If you have very think I mean very thick curly hair, forgot it! You’ll go through this very fast. I didn’t like the cream shampoo AT ALL!! Who came up with that one? Oh right, some one who failed chemistry and was on crack in the lab... it’s awful! Doesn’t feel like your hair is getting cleaned & had to use so much at a time. If you have thin hair maybe it works different? I don’t recommend this, so not worth the money, won’t but this again.
"
"
I've only used this for 3 days so far, but so far so good.  I kept trying other non-toxic products and my hair was getting really tangled and starting to get dry and brittle.  I'm in my early 40s and have fine medium length hair.  It used to be straight, but about a year ago, I noticed it had turned a little wavy, so I stopped blow-drying and straightening it.  It's easy for my hair to dry out and for the waves to look dull.  This set had already improved them moisture and health of my hair and I don't have the horrible tangles anymore.  Time will tell if I continue to like it, but so far I love it.  The scent is not overpowering and is pretty nice and clean smelling.
"
"
This set had a weird smell to it, but I tried it anyway as it is Devacurl and an expensive product line, and I didn't want to waste my money. After a week of using it, ONLY 3 days of actual use, my scalp became very itchy and was caked with a white film. Coincidently, thousands of women online and within the curly hair community are claiming that Devacurl products are ruining their curls and their hair is falling out in clumps (thankful this did not happen to me) and they too have itchy, irritable scalps. I would recommend anyone looking to buy the Devacurl products from any vendor to wait as the company is undergoing quality control. In the meantime, I switched to Neutrogena's Anti-residue shampoo to remove the build up from my scalp and will be trying Carol's Daughters' line of curl products. Plus, once opened, this is nonrefundable and I'm out $40. Bummer!
"

My hair had lost all of its curls after years of flat ironing it. Basically, I'd describe it as just puffy/frizzy/wavy. After using this product twice, I can't say it's Aaamazing but it has helped my hair get some of the curls back. You can definitely see the curls start to get their bounce back and I really like it. It got rid of most and the frizz and now I'd describe my hair as a curly afro that I'd definitely rock in the outside world. It smells nice in my opinion, kinda like menthol? Idk. Mine came with a styling cream that smells like skittles.
"
"
It says this is supposed to smell good, but every time I use it my boyfriend complains that my hair smells like chemicals. This is my first time using this product, so I don't know if this is how its supposed to smell, but he has complained so many times that I am switching to something else. It also makes my thin, fine hair look greasy, even if I rinse out the conditioner thoroughly with cold water. I'm disappointed.
"
"
This product is the best for curls. I have been battling regaining my curls from years of damage by flat ironing. I have tried several different products that didn't to be any results. After one wash I saw a huge difference and after continous use my curls are finally back. Your hair feels light and healthy. Highly recommend this product along with the defining gel.
"
"
This product is amazing! Sulfate free, and as I learned on Netflix's ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"", fewer suds equals healthier hair. I also purchased the conditioner and a hair serum by a brand named Herstyler on the recommendation of a friend with lovely, shiny curls. I will never return to my drug store shampoos! This is so much gentler on my normally thick and frizzy hairvthat I see a difference after only 3 washings. Will definately be reordering!
"
"
Eh. I guess I am unimpressed with the whole Deva Curl experience. I had a cut this summer, and it was terrible. I had to cut it again myself at home. I decided to finally give the product a try, and both times I've used it I find my hair feeling dry and in unremarkable condition. Big disappointment for me and my curly hair. I am willing to pay for a good product that will pamper my natural hair, and this is not it.
"
"
I have been using the shampoo and conditioner on and off for a while now and I really do like the way it makes my curls feel hydrated and takes away the frizz. I didn’t notice a difference right away, took some time and also I use a leave in condotioner now so that helps a lot too. The shampoo itself does not leather but I can tell it’s still getting my hair clean and therefore doing its job. The conditioner is not a deep conditioner so don’t expect it to be super smooth and slippery, it is just a regular conditioner in my opinion.It smells really great, I would say the shampoo is like a rose scent and the conditioner is definitely a gardenia scent, so both are very floral but also fresh. It’s not overwhelming.I gave it four stars because I was not a huge fan of the conditioner being just a regular conditioner. I feel that it should be a little deeper considering it’s for curly hair.
"
"
I actually didn't like either product at all. They made my curly hair frizzier and  it felt drier unless i left the conditioner in. So I wouldn't purchase again. I have crazy kinky curls, super thick hair. I was very underwhelmed with this product and wanted to like it so bad! It worked better on my little sisters finer curls, but still not worth the money in my opinion. Pretty bummed because I really wanted to like it.

I have thick, curly hair and I had a love/hate relationship with my curls until I started using Devacurl products two years ago. Before Devacurl, I would frequently have bad hair days where my hair was flat or frizzy. Now, I rarely have bad hair days and my curls are bouncy and shiny. I also use a deep conditioner at least once a week and I use the Devacurl styling products, but these are my go to shampoo and conditioner. They're a little pricey, but these bottles last me 6 months or more because a little goes a long way.
"
"
I have coarse, auburn, loose curly hair, and this is the only shampoo/conditioner combo that I can honestly say makes a difference. My curls are so much more predictable, soft and healthy. I only wash my hair about once a week, and the frizz is all but gone (I live in Atlanta, too). I pair it with their light gel which is not crunchy at all. Love the scant. Buying the huge bottles next time.
"
"
I have been having an itchy, irritated, flaky and sometimes burning scalp and have had a lot of hair loss. I attributed it to winter, anxiety or just plain old aging. Unfortunately it’s all due to Devacurl. I didn’t have this trouble with the last bottle I bought but this specific one I have. Will not be using Devacurl products in the future.
"
"
I really wanted to like this shampoo and conditioner but I can’t.  It leaves my hair feeling greasy.  I haven’t used a brush on my hair in years as I usually just run my fingers through it when I condition, but I have found tangles and knots after using these products. I had planned on using them for at least a few weeks to give them a chance, but cannot.  Supermarket brands seems to work better than this one. I hope you have better luck.
"
"
I am loving the way my hair is turning out after using these. The Low-Poo smells awesome to me and I love that my hair isn't dried out after. I will be moving to the No-Poo after this bottle is done though. Not because it does not work, but because the DC professionals have stated that for thirsty hair the No-Poo is better. The One conditioner is a dream. I love using it as my leave in. For now I am using up my Mixed Chicks deep Co so DC One Co is my leave in after my detangling. But I will not have a problem switching to using the One Co for all my detangling needs later.
"
"
I''m not sure about this stuff. It made my hair soft and nice, but it leaves a residue on my scalp and sometimes little lesions. However, my daughter doesn't notice anything. I'd recommend trying it.
"
"
This is the best curly hair shampoo I have ever found!!  I love it!  Cleans the hair but transforms your curls to healthy and soft.  The more I used the better my hair became.  I just shampoo my hair in sections.  I bought the jumbo size so I would not run out for a while.
"
"
I did not try these on because they both smell (especially the conditioner) like strong chemical detergent. Im afraid they were tampered with. Not sure since it doesnt seem like they come with a seal but they smelled really bad.Ia going to order directly from the devacurl website and see if it smells the same.
"
"
It is shampoo and conditioner -- I have been using these for many years.  They leave curly hair moisturized and shiny -- tough to accomplish when it is naturally very curly.  All the Deva products I have used have been helpful.
"
"
I Am a repeat customer. My hair is curly frizzy now gets this under control and gets the soap crud out of my hair Love the anti frizz and holding gel too. Hint...a little goes a long way!
"
"
I have been using this shampoo on my hair for years now. The conditioner helps things from drying out, and everyone always tells me that my hair smells wonderful. So, it totally works.I used to hate taking care of my hair because no one else in my immediate family has curly hair,  and they would give me terrible advice, or be disapproving. But now I am able to manage things well, and don’t have to spend obnoxious amount of money on stuff that doesn’t work.
"
"
Great product, I have curly hair and these products work like magic on my hair.  The No Poo doesn't dry out my hair like regular shampoos, and the conditioner is really thick and creamy, great for my dry, curly hair
"
"
This product is alright. My hair feels a lot softer and is a lot less frizzy, but I don't know if it does the best job at cleaning your hair. It sometimes feels bogged down at the roots.
"
"
The smell of the co ditioner is so so strong smells like RAID!! I really want to love these products since they are so expensive but can’t stand the smell !
"
"
The original is so much better. Then dried out my scalp really bad. I had to do a coconut oil treatment three days in a row to get it make to normal. The smell is nice but it didn't do anything for my curls.
"
"
I only used this once and it did make my hair soft but had a horrible chemical smell so I returned it. My hair stylist thought it may have been expired so I ordered some samples through her to see if I like it.
"
"
Smelled kind of bad, didn't feel like it did much as far as treating or curling. I also felt like I was losing a lot more hair in the shower when using this. I prefer getting a silicone free sulfate free set from the drugstore for much cheaper.
"
"
I was sceptical trying these products, I had tried the wavemaker in the past and I wasn't a fan. Along with these products I tried the ultra defining gel, it's day 2 now and I'm thrilled with the results. I have 2c wavy hair that's usually out of control once it reaches past my shoulders (think Natasha Lyonne from Orange is the New black.) This stuff smoothed my hair out and when I added in the gel I got nice defined waves. Hopefully it continues to work so I don't have to cut it short again!
"
"
Product works great for naturally curly hair, but is not as nearly moisturizing enough. Had to add additional deep conditioner to use with this product.
"
"
Honestly, I have a hard time with the no lather shampoo. I was hoping I would get used to it, but the more I use it the more I dislike it. My hair still feels a little dirty even though I extensively researched how to apply it for best results.
"
"
The best Shampoo & Conditioner ever. I have fine thin color treated wavy frizzy hair.  I used this for 2 years a couple of years ago. Then I took a break & have not found anything as good. The place next to my home quit selling it so I came to Amazon. I am impressed. It's the real deal. Shipped perfectly. No leaks or spills. My hair is so happy again. I wash my hair every day too. This stuff makes my hair happy. Highly reccomend this seller & product.
"
"
I LOVE this stuff! I originally bought my first set at Ulta and fell in love but have found Amazon has much better deals than Ulta!! its perfect for curly hair once you try it you will never go back to traditional shampoo and conditioner! It makes you hair so soft and lightweight and your curls curlier!
"
"
I used Deva Curl Products since August 2019.  My hair began to fall out during using Deva Curl Products.  Thinking it was age or hormones I did not relate the hair loss to the Deva Curl product until a few weeks ago when I became aware of the hair loss issue with MULTIPLE people.  I've stopped using this product and I strongly suggest you do also.  There is a class action law suit being formed over Deva Curl products.
"
"
Omg.  I don’t like non-lather shampoos but this stuff really works!  Because it doesn’t lather you end up using more than a regular shampoo but this feels so good on your hair.  I only panic because it so expensive.  But beauty costs money so here I go.  Love devacurl!  Thanks Ayesha!
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and since I started using this my hair is definitely less frizzy and the curl is much more defined
"
"
I enjoyed using this product.  My naturally curly hair was chemically damaged.  I used this line of products to help my hair look better until it could grow out and be trimmed off.
"
"
I bought this shampoo because regular shampoo leaves my hair too freezy. Co washing leaves my hair too greasy after a time so I thought this low poo shampoo was the key. It was not. The shampoo doesn’t clean my hair at all. It left it stiff and greasy feeling after using it for 2 weeks. It was difficult to detangle with my fingers after a time due to the greasiness. Smells weird too. The conditioner is ok hence the 2 stars. I have wavy/curly hair
"
"
If you have even a slight curl in your hair, buy this!!! My hair has always been wavy/frizzy/curly, and after literally the first use of this, my hair was light and perfectly curled even by air drying!!! You will never regret the money spent on a good shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
So far so good! For the first time since I was a toddler I have good curls! Barely any frizz and I live in a high humidity area. For the first time in many years I am enjoying letting my hair down during the summer and for the first time my hair looks good air dried. Product does arrive in a plastic bottle that is recyclable but would like to see product switched to a glass bottle to be more eco friendly. A refilling service would also be a great eco friendly bonus!
"
"
My curls look great!! Everybody wants to know what i use to make them look so curly!!
"
"
The product is great for my hair, but the smell makes me not want to use it
"
"
I have wavy 2B hair type. Bought the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo was so smelly that I couldn't use it. It smells like old lady fake roses and the smell lasted days. I continued to use the conditioner (btw smells like sunblock). The conditioner is just okay. Doesn't seem to do anything special for my hair. I'm using it with Surface Curls shampoo. I shampoo only once a week and condition at least twice a week. I won't be buying Devacurl again.
"
"
I first experienced this stuff when at a curly-hair-centric salon in Minneapolis. The shampoo somehow cleans your hair without stripping the oils from it. It's magic, I don't know. And a little bit of the conditioner goes a long way. And they both smell heavenly, and make my hair clean and shiny like no other shampoo or conditioner ever have. For ladies with curly hair, there is no better product line under the sun as far as I know.
"
"
Do not buy this product. It caused a huge hair loss for me as many other costumes here. SO disappointed. I cried in the shower as I could not believe that disaster. I hope they fix the formula, it did not work well with California water on my hair .
"
"
I loved it! Made my hair soft and my curls poppin! Not to expensive but still got to try the products out to see if I wanted the full size. Lasted me (3c thick hair) about 2-3 weeks. I’m switching over to deva fully. And I’ve used deva in the past but I just can never get over how good it makes my hair look and feel. The smell and moisture are an added bonus !
"
"
The best cleanser for naturally curly/wavy hair ever! It's like a miracle for my dry/curly! Tends-to- frizz hair. I love it! My hair actually shines again!
"
"
I love this stuff! My hair is so different (in a good way) since I stopped using sulfates and silicone. Finally I have an easy curly hairdo in 10 minutes!
"
"
I was so disappointed when I decided to splurge on this shampoo and it arrived with 1/4 of the shampoo leaked all over the package. 🤦‍♀️
"
"
My granddaughter (12) loves this shampoo and conditioner.  She has mixed ethnic hair and this really controls it.  She gets compliments all the time.
"
"
Beat shampoo I’ve ever used hands down. Don’t be alarmed that there are no suds, it cleans your hair wonderfully.
"
"
Tangled my hair.  Don’t live it.
"
"
Makes his hair feels great
"
"
I love this product, but the no-poo original conditioning cleanser came completely broken. The package arrived today and, as you can see, the top is literally broken so there will definitely be some difficulty using it now. Like the headline says I love this product but I will not be purchasing from this seller again because I'm not even sure how you break a bottle cap like this.
"
"
Love this product! Where was this curly hair technology when I was growing up? Has made a huge difference in my curly hair. I use a lot less product.
"
"
My sister has used this for years and her hair looks great. Borrowed some from her and it made my curly frizzy hair feel great and tamed the frizz. With all the products I've used over the years, this is the best.
"
"
I love this stuff! I've had problems with my hair smelling every now and again due to a product build up that can happen with different products (mostly the fake stuff that promotes smooth and sleek hair) but this stuff fixed that as well as conditioning and not being tough on my hair. P.s I have purple hair and does not strip the color as fast as other products do. Always come back for more!
"
"
It made my hair very nice and curly, but I had so much hair fallout that it was concerning. After my first time using it, I figured it was because it was a new product  and my hair wasn’t used to it. But the same thing happened when I started it again for a second time. The costs outweighs the benefit.
"
"
So far I’ve only used the cleanser once and the daily leave in twice. But beforehand I was thinking about cutting my hair due to heat damage which I thought had take the entire front half of my hair. Upon using these products, it appears that a much smaller section of my hair is heat damaged and it seems a lot more likely that I can just grow it out
"
"
It doesn't work as well as the hype made it sound. My hair is waist length and thick. I have to use sooooo much to manage my hair. I have to use at least 2 handfuls each time. I found another brand that works better for me uses half as much and literally costs a third as much.
"
"
My product arrived damaged.  The cap was broken and a lot of the content spilled.  Disappointing.
"
"
Dried out my hair after several uses. Worked fairly well to control my frizz at first then my hair became dry after several uses. Maybe just not for my hair type
"
"
I have very curly, frizzy hair. I live in a humid climate which makes it worse. I think this works well only if you use the gel or B’Leave In Miracle plumper along with it.
"
"
This is the most amazing shampoo and conditioner for curls. And it doesn’t harm my color.
"
"
New to product line. Love the smell. Light, fruity. Shampoe does not foam up - must wet hair thourouly before applying. Love how it revitalizes my fine cury hair leaving soft and cury...no frizz. Hurray!!
"
"
I DID NOT receive this item for free or a discount. I hate that Amazon does that because I do not feel that the feedback is reliable. Knowing that I have decided to sit down an write feedback for every item I have bought as I read all feed back before buying and do not feel most is truthful.Works great on my daughters curls.  Would purchase again.
"
"
The smell was too much for me, went back to original
"
"
Didn’t think these would have worked week but my hair was really clean with no lather. Expensive but would purchase again
"
"
I have been on ""no poo"" regiment of baking soda and apple cider vinegar for 6 years now. This is the first shampoo I've been able to use regularly without getting dryness, itching, and flaking from my scalp.
"
"
I use nothing else.
"
"
OMG!!!  My curls are so much more hydrated.  I use this product with the cream and made a big difference.
"
"
Perfect for my 3A curls.  I pair this with  DevaCurl Wavemaker, following the curly girl method, and my curls have finally returned!
"
"
I do like this but I am not inlove.  I probably will not get the no poo again, as I can just use a conditioner.  The conditioner could moisturize better, but it does get the job done.
"
"
Ok
"
"
Stuff is pretty good it makes my curly hair soft I guess.
"
"
I have been buying this product for months now love it . I have thick curly hair  the shampo doesn't lather away your hair color . You use a lot more shampo then conditioner , it used to be the other way around with other brands .
"
"
I love this conditioner!  I do the Girly Curl method so use this to ""wash"" my hair as well as a leave in conditioner. My hair looks (and smells) great!
"
"
Leaves my hair super soft and moisturized. it is no doubt a great shampoo and conditioner. It's very lightweight and I have thin hair, so I like the fact that it doesn't weigh my hair down.
"
"
Ok
"
"
This stuff isn't cheap but it works great.  Bought it for my son who has really curly hair and his hair looks great when he uses the DevaCurl products
"
"
I read so many reviews and heard great things about it so thought I'd give it a try. I was so disappointed!! Gave it two weeks. My hair was thinned out and got tangled and broke easily. I noticed more hair loss than usual and no shine.I've since switched and 3 days in, my hair looks and feels better.
"
"
The cleanliness is amazing. Not really much of a scent but I don't mind that as long as the product does what it'claims to do.
"
"
My daughter will now ONLY use the Low-Poo! After years of trying new products on her natural hair, we stumbled across this. She uses it weekly and loves it. We have purchased twice now and I believe this will be a staple for a long time.
"
"
Deva curls just did not work the way we thought it would for our daughters thick curly hair, actually felt lie it made her hair worst, left a nasty gunk in her hair
"
"
Love this product! Works wonders on my curly hair!
"
"
I like the shampoo & conditioner of DevaCurl. However it came unsealed and the shampoo smelled like gum. I wanted to return it but since I had already started using I did not. High possibility of not being genuine.
"
"
Fought my curls for 50 years. Now I love them thanks to this miracle product line.
"
"
Happy customer
"
"
My wife loves this shampoo and conditioner.  Amazon has the best price always for it!
"
"
I have Spanish curly hair naturally, but this product does not work for me.
"
"
My hair felt soft but heavy.  Still had some curl.  I tried it twice and my face itched where the hair touched my cheeks.  Couldn't use it.
"
"
I like it but, i received 2 No poo original. It was supposed to be one No-Poo original and one condition. Please be careful
"
"
Love the way it moistures the hair
"
"
The chemicals irritate my scalp, the smell is so un-natural.
"
"
Sadly this just didn't work for me
"
"
This duo is great for cleaning and moisturizing my hair.  Only have to wash my hair once unless I have a lot of product in my hair.
"
"
I am still evaluating this. I do like it but I am not saying that I will continue to buy it and would be open to trying something that might work even better
"
"
Girlfriend loves it
"
"
Olor muy rico
"
"
I still don't like the way deva curl smells, but it works.
"
"
Seems to work well for my naturally curly hair! My hair is still a bit frizzy at times but much improved!
"
"
I have very unruly curly hair and turned to devacurl to revitalize,  however, after using for over one month the only difference I noticed in my hair was that it didn't feel clean.  I do love their styling products though, but I will stick to mane and tail for shampooing and conditioning.
"
"
The shampoo smelled like there was ammonia in it. It faded my color faster than any other product I have used. I also ended up with some type of reaction, dandruff and a rash on my ear and neck. My hair is also falling out in clumps.
"
"
Before I started using this my hair was dry and had alot of split ends I've been using since December I haven't yet bought a curl plumper or a monster lock in but  I Definitely will be using this product 💝💝💝
"
"
I have used Deva Curl for years. Love the product. Does wonders for natural curly hair
"
"
Unfortunately this product did not work for me. It made my scalp irritated and made my roots extremely greasy.
"
"
Finally I can finger through my hair without pulling significant strands out.  Tangle free makes me happy!
"
"
These products were a very big disappointment. Although I used them according to directions, they left my hair slimy, weighted down ,and unattractive. They were a big waste of money, and I would like a complete refund. Thank you.
"
"
Used the no-poo for over a year and am really happy that I switched to the low-poo. Nice to have lather again and to be able to feel where the shampoo is!
"
"
Love the no poo cleanse and it smells like a baby
"
"
I was so excited to order this because my sister highly recommended it.  Unfortunately, the shampoo smelled like it was old and I was not happy with how my hair came out,
"
"
Fantastic!My curls are are smooth and shineNo frizzies. I love it !!
"
"
Although it does say ""low-poo"" on the bottle it was not. I've tried the ""low-poo"" before and it smells citrusy kind of like oranges and has an orange tint to it. The shampoo I received had more of a flowery chemical smell and was very light almost having no color. I'm guessing I received the ""no-poo"". I mainly purchased to get the ""one condition"" but I would've like to receive what I ordered.
"
"
Every women with curly hair needs this product. The conditioner is awesome as a leave in conditioner as well. I feel like a goddess with this product.
"
"
My new favorite product!
"
"
Great stuff for curly hair
"
"
The package didn't look damaged when I received it, but when I opened it I found that one bottle had broken and spilled into the box.
"
"
My curls look beautiful and my hair doesn’t feel frizzy
"
"
I'm a Deva veteran.  Their products are the best for curly hair.  No heavy fragrance, no stickiness.  It's great stuff!
"
"
The shampoo is very good, but I love the conditioner
"
"
This stuff is so great - just wish it wasn't as expensive as it is
"
"
I like this conditioner but I need to use A LOT, so I go through it pretty quickly. Also works well for me as a leave in conditioner which is nice.
"
"
I felt like these worked well- but the scent was just a little off. It just didn't smell pleasant.
"
"
I tried the trial version sold on Amazon first. Loved it. While this product is packaged the same with the same name and description the smell is awful and nothing like the trial version. Very chemical!
"
"
Takes care of kids dandruff and smells great!!
"
"
Nice fragrance.  Gives my fine, thin hair lots of body.
"
"
My hair feels so light and clean!
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Low rating because I received the wrong item. I received two conditioners instead of one shampoo and one conditioner.
"
"
Love the smell of this product and the way my daughters hair felt after the first use. In general, really enjoying deva curl products so far and the results
"
"
Perfect! These were great to put in my Dopp kit for my business trips.
"
"
I use this shampoo once or twice a week but condition every day. Both products are creamy and wash out clean. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I've found.
"
"
This is great stuff for my dry, coarse and unruly hair.
"
"
Great stuff for curly hair!
"
"
Obsessed with DevaCurl and all their products but these two in particular really make my curls POP!
"
"
takes some getting used to...but overall am happy.
"
"
I have been using this product for a year now. Holds my color and curl well. Much less expensive to buy on line! Thank
"
"
my hair loves these products.
"
"
this i believe has brought back my curls even more .. just have to use the one condition a lot
"
"
Great for curls!
"
"
This product is fake. I expected the conditioner to be smooth and feel like lotion, as I've seen in reviews, but it was extremely crispy and hard. Plus, it's nearly impossible to squeeze out of the bottle and doesn't feel good on my hair. Don't buy from this specific seller!
"
"
I have been using this product for sometime now . Love it
"
"
Great product. Great price.
"
"
Awesome product for my curly hair
"
"
Deva products are awesome.
"
"
Works great for detangling and smells good too. Quit shampoo with this pack.
"
"
Works great!!  Quick ship!  Thanks!
"
"
Sadly this is not the right product for me.  I could not stand the way it made my hair feel (dirty).
"
"
The best for curly hair!
"
"
Terrible product. Dried out my beautiful curls and weight it down.  The worst part is the seller does not accept returns.  I feel robbed.
"
"
The best
"
"
If I could rate this a 0 I would. My hair became super dry and scalp very flaky. I believe whoever the seller is is adding other things in the product.
"
"
Try one time and did not get a food result for my hair. Feels soft and it smell super good.
"
"
Love love this product!  A bit on the expensive side but it do enhances curls.  It also smells great!
"
"
the no poo shampoo has a real funny, almost chemical smell to it.
"
"
prefer the original for my particular hair type
"
"
Hair did not feel clean after shampoo strong gardenia flower smellcream rinse had a horrible smell
"
"
Works great for curly hair!
"
"
This was my first time using a devacurl product. They really help to bring out my curls. I get lots of compliments, especially on the way my hair smells.
"
"
HORRIBLE Worst return policy ever Go to store again dry my hair completely
"
"
A very good product.
"
"
Curls look amazing
"
"
This product is not for my daughter or dried her hair out so bad
"
"
Great shampoo!
"
"
Wonderful product, and great seller.  I'll be buying again. Thank you
"
"
Love
"
"
Only thing that works on my curly hair
"
"
This was bought as a gift, but my gf loves this product. She's had the best result for her curly hair! This product doesn't leave her hair feeling heavy or sticky but rather light and smooth curls.
"
"
What can I say it’s Devacurl awesome product. Their whole line is amazing
"
"
I have been long searching  for a shampoo for my curly hair and I came across this product. So far I am happy with the product.Great and fast shipping.
"
"
The condition worked perfect for my  curly hair.
"
"
Good product, the No Poo is excellent. The conditioner is also good, but I think could hydrate more.
"
"
Smells good, leaves hair shiny, conditioner works well. Using it for a girl with hairs ligthly curled.
"
"
I love this shampoo. It is the best one that I have found for my hair. My hair is thin and very dry, but the roots get oily so I have to wash it everyday. This is gentle enough to use everyday and its the only shampoo that I have used that has made my hair soft. I shower before bed at night, and sometimes when I wake up in the morning my curls are shiny and detangled, so I don't have to do anything to them, and even when its not perfect, all I have to do is comb it with my fingers. It smells OK and gives my hair volume without drying it out.
"
"
Great product, keeps my curly style frizz free all day.
"
"
This stuff smells SO bad. When I first opened it, it smelled similar to dog flea medication - but I genuinely think it's worse than that. It just smells like medicine. Not only does it smell terrible, it made my hair so frizzy. My curls both smelled bad and looked awful. Would NOT recommend to anyone.
"
"
These are the only curly hair products I need (also their gel). It has made a huge difference in tangles in my curls.
"
"
This product is great for curly or wavy hair.  My hairdresser commented on how healthy my hair feels.  I also love the gels that Deval Curl offers.  Great product and reasonable priced.
"
"
Great shampoo for curly hair.  You only have to use a little so you save money.  Love the conditioner as well.
"
"
The ingredients have changed significantly sinceDeva was bought by L'Oréal. My hair doesn't feE5l near as clean and soft as it did before.
"
"
Not near as moisturing as the original deva curl products. Disappointed.
"
"
I bought this product because I've heard so many great things about the devacurl line. I was highly impressed by the amount of slippage the conditioner and cleanser provided. I sectioned off my hair and finger detangled my hair in the shower as well as used a wide tooth comb. Afterwards I used my own leave in conditioner while my hair was still soaking wet. I used cantu Shea butter line with Argan oil. This is a great product and I will be trying out more of the devacurl products !
"
"
I was expecting greater results
"
"
Used product previously
"
"
Works well for my hair.3a-b moisturizing my curls like a beach.
"
"
works perfect
"
"
Define curly hair
"
"
It's a great product  for my curly hair.  I leave plenty of the conditioner in - never wash it all out.  My curls are defined, frizz free and look really healthy.
"
"
My curls love both of these products! And it came exactly as expected, very happy with it.
"
"
I love these products! The best thing I ever did for my curls. They have so much body and definition. 😍
"
"
Description says no poo and one conditioner but was sent low poo and one conditioner.
"
"
Worst product!!!!!
"
"
Great for my long (mid back) and ridiculously thick hair.  It’s a little weird that the shampoo doesn’t suds up but you get used to it.
"
"
To my surprise I found I liked these products.  I would buy these again
"
"
Wife loves it, keeps her hair soft
"
"
speedy delivery and excellent product. Great for maintenance of natural curly hair
"
"
Leaked all over inside the box
"
"
I absolutely love this product!
"
"
Exactly as described, fast shipping!

As advertised.  Cannot beat same day shipping. I ordered at 10 am and received it before 9 pm. Both products are authentic, same as in salons.
"
"
Love it so much purchased the bigger sizes
"
"
I wish I never purchased this shampoo and conditioner! The first few washes, my hair was great, but after about two weeks my hair became flat and felt awful. My scalp became very dry and flaky and I noticed I was losing more hair than normal. I went back to my previous shampoo and conditioner (Giovanni) and my hair is healthy and flake free again.This hair product may work well for others, but not for me!
"
"
Great products and great prices.
"
"
Love it, it's lightweight, gets the job done, and has no buildup!
"
"
Best thing ever for my hair
"
"
The shampoo and the conditioner gave my curls more definition
"
"
I'm a fan. Won't use any other shampoo/conditioner
"
"
I love  this kit it's a just what I needed for my curly hair. It leaves my mangle without being stiff. I recommend it.
"
"
Item cap was broken when I received it.
"
"
Perfect for curly hair.
"
"
smell is too strong for me and it ended up weighing my hair down a little too much.
"
"
It makes my hair soooooo curly and takes out all if the friz! It smells great too!
"
"
Curls look great! (Burns my toddlers eyes though - so I have to be careful)
"
"
It works well with my hair ! It doesn't dry out my hair and it smells great too!
"
"
what my daughter needed and price is great..
"
"
Great for my curly hair.
"
"
I love this product,and have been using them both for 20 years.
"
"
Did not like it. 2 stars was being kind.
"
"
Awesome product, hair is soft and shiny.
"
"
Product is working great on my baby girl's hair! Been recommending it to everyone that asks what we are using.
"
"
good
"
"
Didn't dry my hair and allowed my natural curl to remain soft
"
"
I'm really not sure what the hype is all about. The shampoo and conditioner have a really strong scent. And both left my hair feeling really dry.  I would never flat iron my hair after using these products, as my hair felt too brittle to take anything like that.After trying out several shampoos and conditioners, I found Aveda's damage care line to be the best on my naturally curly hair.
"
"
Fast shipping, and the product was amazing!
"
"
Super products.
"
"
great combo; conditioner not heavy; reduced frizzy hair dramatically
"
"
Love the shine it gives my hair, love the no lather clean.
"
"
This shampoo is really gentle and does not dry out your hair.
"
"
I love this shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Love it brings back my curls and makes my hair super soft!!!
"
"
i had been using Hair One cleansing conditioner for years and really liked it, but i decided to try something different because it just didn't seem to cleanse as well as it used to. i thought i'd really like this product, but it left my curly hair sooooo dry and felt noticeably damaged. made my hair fall out!
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Came half empty.
"
"
It work for natural curl
"
"
It's still early days for me with this product. But I've definitely seen improvements in the last 2 weeks. My curls were so dry it hurt to touch. The first thing I noticed was just how much softer and shinier they got after 2 washes. I used the Devacurl gel along with it. If there's any drawback it's that I feel like I need to use more product, but maybe that's just me getting used to a no poo method. Definitely sticking with this for the next 6months.
"
"
I love this product!!! It's amazing for your hair!
"
"
I was in the fence about buying this for months and finally did it.  I was not impressed with the performance of this product. If anything, my hair was more frizzy. I used it for a solid month and even used the microfiber towel with it.The no-poo aspect wasn't as wierd as I thought it was going to be though. My hair was always clean after using it. Going back to my Loreal product!
"
"
It's ok. But not worth the hype
"
"
Great shampoo and conditioner for my curly hair. I have been using the product for over a year and my curls have never looked better. I will confess some days I skip the conditioner and just use the no-poo, because it can be a little heavy with my product as well.
"
"
Amaizing!!!!!
"
"
Love these products!
"
"
OBSESSED. This stuff changed the game.
"
"
Horrible to NATURALLY curly hair! Hair falls out in hand fulls!!! Have tried multiple sulfate free products and this is the worst so far.
"
"
It didn't really help. It completely dried out the ends of my hair which I'm having hard time to make it not so dry anymore. :(
"
"
I have straight hair and love Devacurl!! It does not make my hair curly which is not why I use it anyway. Since using it I am always receiving compliments on my hair. I have co workers commenting on how fast it's growing! I highly recommend Devacurl whether you have straight or curly hair...you will love it!!!
"
"
Love DevaCurl!  Works great with my perm to create those longer corkscrew-like curls.  Conditioner does not weigh my hair down.
"
"
it's a great product for those with frizzy curly hair. only product I've found that really works & smells good too
"
"
I've been using this for 20 years.  Good Stuff!
"
"
I love these products.  Having a non-lathering shampoo has been an adjustment but I like the results.  I think I need to get a certified ""Deva Curl"" haircut to maximize the benefit of this product line.  I still have some curls that don't commit into curls, I'm not sure if that is hair texture, technique or the need for a new style.
"
"
Great and arrived early
"
"
did not work for me, but it does my friend.
"
"
I bought this for my daughter's hair which is very curly and dry.  I didn't really see a difference or change in her hair when I used this.
"
"
When I use this shampoo and conditioner, my hair feels so soft and manageable. It gives my curls definition and doesn't strip my hair.
"
"
favorite hair product out there for curly hair, and amazon has great prices
"
"
The product smells great, but I'm not sold on the No-Poo Shampoo. I don't think it's an effective cleanser and have had multiple breakouts since starting to use the product.
"
"
I don't care for the shampoo, like the condition.
"
"
bought as figt and she loves it
"
"
Gentle shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my curls well hydrated and soft and bouncy!This is hands down the best set for curly hair!
"
"
This stuff makes my hair feel so greasy and like I didn't even wash it
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and have tried everything! I love this and will continue to use it! I've been using this for over a year now.
"
"
It really works, my granddaughter loves it
"
"
Product arrived with a broken cap in the box.
"
"
Can't say enough about Deva Curl. Took a while because I thought it was a little expensive so I bought everything else under the sun spending hundreds by the time it was all said in done. One day I tried a new stylist and she recommend Deva Curl form my texture (3c and really thick in the crown). She did a finger style with the additional DC products and I loved it. My new staple products.
"
"
Let me preface by saying I did not buy this product off of amazon. I bought it at my local Bed, Bath and Beyond, but wanted to share my review so that others wouldn't have to make the same mistake.I used the No-Poo and Conditioner all of 3 times and each time I noticed each time more and more hair falling out. I always shed hair in the shower, but this was and excessive amount compared to usual not to mention the dozens of hairs I lose throughout the day. I don't trust it which is sad because it made my curls look fantastic, but so not worth going bald for fantastic curls. Avoid this product if you want to keep your hair on your head.
"
"
5 stars
"
"
This is a fake product. Look at the wrong color blue they put on their fake labels.
"
"
My daughter loves it
"
"
This stuff actually straightens my curly hair. A waste of money.
"
"
I love the way my hair looks after I use this but the smell is unbearable. Smells like straight bathroom cleaner.
"
"
Amazing difference after just one wash. My curls are so soft and the frizz was cut way down. I'm going for the bigger bottle next time.
"
"
great product.

As most curly girls can agree, we’ve tried everything.  I know I have.  I’ve wasted so much money on products and have had to throw them away because they flat out, don’t work.  I started using Deva Curl Products a few years ago and although I occasionally switch to another brand due to the cost, I always come back to DEVA.  Like every great love, I come crawling back, BECAUSE IT’S THE ONE!  Both the no-poo and conditioner actually moisturize the hair shaft, instead of coating the hair in silicone giving the illusion of moisture( like other brands).  Sometimes, I don’t even need to use styling product because my hair is so soft and moisturized from this line.  If you have dry, damaged or course hair, I highly recommend this line of products.
"
"
Perfect for our 4A-4C Family!  I use the DevaCurl Shampoo and Conditioner, then KinkyCurly Leave In for 4A hair.  I use the same shampoo and conditioner, but then Shea Moisture Low-Porosity Leave In for our 4B/C curly heads.  You can feel the moisturizing process even starting with the shampoo.  It is mild enough to use several days a week with gym and swimming workouts.  I find that it works better to use the shampoo and conditioner every time.  No need to co-wash with conditioner with this ladies--the results are better using both together.  We get clean, soft, shiny, curly defined hair every time.
"
"
I love this product, it has done WONDERS for my hair. I have fine hair that my grandmother once described as ""bendy""--as in it will shape itself around something, like my ear or a hair tie or clip, but generally hung almost straight. I've had a lot of trouble finding a shampoo and conditioner that will moisturizer my hair without leaving it oily, and will clean it well without drying out my scalp and my hair. This is the stuff. Not only does my hair better follow its natural wavy tendencies now that it has proper nutrition, it also doesn't need to be washed every day. It's shiny and sleek and wavy and my scalp is not dry or itchy. I can go at least a day without washing it and it still looks fine, just toss it in a bun for the day and I'm off! It smells interesting, especially the conditioner--the grape seed oil is pretty apparent, but it definitely doesn't smell bad, just unusual. Only things I don't like are the cost and the fact that you have to use a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean. However, since I don't have to wash it every day, I think it equals out. There is a learning curve as far as how much to use, and I found that I had to be careful not to miss a spot or else it wouldn't get clean because it doesn't lather. Once I figured out that having your hair really wet before starting to shampoo helps, I was golden. Great product, definitely going to stick with it.
"

I really wanted to like this stuff, and used an entire bottle of it, using it exclusively, over the last couple months before writing this review. I have a thick head of fine, armpit-length hair that makes 'shirley temple' ringlets (or looser), and I also have bangs. My favorite shampoo/conditioner is Davines 'love' purple smoothing shampoo and conditioner, which runs about twice the price as Devacurl. I then style with redken's frizz dismiss oil and curvaceous full swirl, or ouai wave spray. So I'm picky about my hair. Unfortunately, this product doesn't live up to my expectations. I'm sure 'no lather' works great for a lot of people and I really tried to give it a go and even got used to the sensation of scrubbing sans bubbles, but my bangs were stringy, limp, and greasy as soon as they dried, no matter how much dry shampoo or gel I put in them. The conditioner also weighed down my hair, and still unfortunately wasn't enough to keep frizz from lifting from my curls throughout the day- at least, not compared to my normal routine of basically masking my hair every time I wash it. I definitely agree that this stuff is miles better for curls than any basic shampoo, but it's back to Davines for me.

I bought the travel size as a trial size before committing to the full size bottles. I absolutely love the NoPoo shampoo. It got my hair clean without making it squeaky. It felt really good to not have the lather getting in the way, this way I could more accurately feel where I had really cleaned my hair and scalp, resulting in a more thorough cleaning. In comparison, I accidentally bought the LowPoo shampoo version, and haaaaate that one as it does lather (more than a little) and I found I just cant get my hair as clean with it.The conditioner — well, it’s fine. I havent found it to be especially remarkable when compared to other similar, cheaper, conditioners (Shea Moisture is maybe $6 and does just as well).Both shampoo and conditioner do have a bit of a chemical, hair salon type smell to them. I thought this would bother me as I am generally sensitive to strong smells, but I am relieved to find that this has not been a problem with these products.Overall, I love the NoPoo and highly recommend it. The conditioner isnt bad, but I recommend a cheaper option.

Absolutely a huge fan! I honestly did a lot of research before I order these products. Be careful that you’re getting the actual diva curl brand and not knock off brand. I would pick the Amazon choice and not an alternate buy absolutely a huge fan! I honestly did a lot of research before I order these products. Be careful that you’re getting the actual diva curl brand and not knock off brand. I would pick the Amazon choice and not an alternate seller  to try and save money. The products are absolutely worth the price. My hair was so damaged that my curls were just frizzy straw. The first week I used the product I kept waiting to go bald or something because it felt too good to be true. I’ve now been using these products for a little over two months.  I barely put anything in my hair anymore.  It feels so healthy and my curls are looking great! You should still do some research on which products will best fit your hair type. If you already have very healthy hair I wouldn’t recommend any of the styling products. Just the shampoo (No-poo). You could Overland your hair with protein and make it stringy and unpleasant.

I live in a high desert, extremely dry environment, not a good climate for girls with curls.  I wanted a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but this product is heavy, like working lotion into your hair and rinsing it out.  Not a good look for fine hair.  If your hair is course and curly, this might be a good product for you.
"
"
I used to love Deva products, and while it's true that they're good for bouncy curls, they're not great for scalp health. After a few months of use I had a lot of flakes. At first I thought it was the Deva gel having dried out but quickly narrowed it down to the shampoo. When you look this up online you can see that a lot of people complain that the No-Poo causes flakes/dandruff. I then found some success limiting my use of the no-poo to no more than once per week, for special occasions or when I wanted my curls to look their best. I've now stopped using it entirely as I prefer to have a healthy, flake-free scalp.
"
"
I have been using this for several weeks and am extremely disappointed in the conditioner. It smells like it has gone bad and nothing like the actual conditioner. It’s scent is heavy in chemicals and very bland. Nothing like the fresh, minty smell the actual product should exude. It also leaves a lot of nasty build up on my hair. I can’t seem to find a link to contact the seller via Amazon, and when I called DevaCurl’s main line, they refused to help. I definitely discourage anyone from purchasing this product because I do not think you will receive what you think you are purchasing.
"
"
I have been trying everything ever since Aveda reformulated their shampoo into something unusable for me.  Curly haired people know how difficult it is to find the right product.  I'm now using this combo, and it is working for me.  I like the low-poo better than the no-poo.  It is not drying, and it leaves my curls soft and spirally. The conditioner is also good as a leave-in, and only a tiny bit is needed.  Best tip ever for curly hair:  do not dry with a terri towel, use cotton knit (like a tee shirt) - makes huge difference in preventing frizz.
"
"
I'm a devotee. There's nothing better (for my curly hair, at least) than Deva Care hair products.  I've tried everything, & as a baby boomer, I have many years of trying(!), & hands down, Deva No Poo, conditioners, light gel for after washing/conditioning--just do the trick.No additives, smell wonderful, created by Lorraine Massey, a curly girl herself, & price is right on Amazon.Simplified my life--no need to be tempted by other hair products anymore, yea!👍🏼
"
"
A little pricey, but my curls are loving it!  Got after asking for a recommendation from someone with beautiful natural curls.  Watched the YouTube video on how to make it work,  bought the sample size kit, and wow!  Amazing curls that I can finally love.  Wish I had found these products years ago!
"
"
I was so surprised how well my hair responded to these products.  After a recent highlight my hair became frizzy and now I have defined curls.  I followed the directions and found it a bit heavy (since my curls are probably cherub) so I use it my way and it works well:  wash with ""no poo"", conditioner and comb with a wide tooth, lightly rinse, followed by the light hold gel, the Deva curl microfiber towel and then let the curls dry naturally.  I even made a spray mister with 1/2 water and 1/2 conditioner and use it to revitalize my curls on the second and third day.
"
"
I have been using Deva products for more than a dozen years now and I find that the No Poo and One Condition are still my favorite go to shampoo and conditioner.  I do find that the No Poo weighs down my combination hair during the winter months so I usually switch it out for the Lo Poo until the spring.  If you have dry hair, then this would work for you year round.
"
"
This product has worked amazing on my wavy/curly hair! I also starting using the gel, foam, and clips to dry -and my hair seems to get better everytime I use it! I am 38 years old and literally just learned how to finally take care of my hair- I thought I’f you had frizzy hair that wasn’t super curly- heat was the only option. I had no idea that using the right product - and basically leaving it alone made nice frizz free curls
"
"
I don't have naturally curly hair. I do get perms though. I usually have to get a perm once every 6 weeks for it to look nice. But after using deva curl, I haven't had to get one yet and it's been 8 months. However, I prefer the no-poo over the low-poo. I feel like the low-poo makes my hair oily faster and I don't know why.
"
"
DevaCurl hair products SAVED my hair! I recommend anyone with any type of curl in their hair to use all of the DevaCurl products. They transform your curls beautiful and in a very short period of time! You can never go wrong with DevaCurl.
"
"
My daughter has the same hair I do.  She came for a visit and looked amazing!  Her stylist had turned her on to these products.  I took the quiz, bought the stuff and watched all the tutorials.  I later invested in the blow dryer and last week had my first Devacut.  I highly recommend these products!
"
"
This isn't the kind of product where you use it once and instantly fall in love. It takes commitment to using it for two weeks straight. Once your hair has had time to adjust to the product, then you will fall in love with it.
"
"
I have mixed feelings about these products but they are mostly positive. I have a mix of 2c, 3a, and 3b hair that is fine and fairly porous. Using this every day, my hair got rather dry and frizzy but with a little experimenting, I've figured out how to use these products to suit my needs.LOW-POO: Love the low-poo!! It gets my hair squeaky clean but also moisturizes and detangles really well. My hair is SO soft after using this, even before I use conditioner. I massage it into my roots in sections. I do use quite a bit, as the bubbles don't ""spread"" as easily as traditional shampoos. However, (as described in my routine below) I only use this every few days so it still lasts me a long time (from August to December thus far).ONE CONDITION: I think One Condition is not moisturizing enough for my hair. However, One Condition works GREAT as a co-wash (I think the glycerin helps with this). I ended up buying a different, heavier conditioner to add to my routine. Here's what I do now. Day 1: Low-poo + heavy conditioner. Day 2-4: Co-wash with One Condition + heavy conditioner. Repeat! My hair is now super soft, shiny, healthy, and frizz-free. Woohoo!!Overall, I would definitely purchase the Low-poo again (although there are cheaper sulfate-free options out there). However, I don't think One Condition is worth it for me as it is pretty expensive, and I go through it too quickly using it as a co-wash almost everyday. I now buy a cheaper light conditioner for my co-washing needs and spend more money on a good heavy conditioner instead.
"
"
I have heard such rave reviews about this product that I finally splurged when I got a gift card for Christmas.  I am not as happy with either product. It cleans my hair well but I need a better conditioner.  My curly hair doesn't seem any more manageable (or curly) than when I am using my organic sulfate free products from the natural store.  Probably won't re-purchase.  I may try another set from their line as maybe my curls just need more moisture.
"
"
I wanted to try this product and I have gotten 4 washes and still have more product.  Just ordered the larger sizes.  Love them and what they do for my curly wavy fine hair.
"
"
If you haven't found a deva trained stylist, do it. Curly hair needs special treatment. My daughter struggled for years with frizz and this stuff actually works. Especially if you get a good cut and get shown what not to do with curly hair.
"
"
I bought this for my daughter upon recommendation of a friend with curly hair. I went on YouTube for instructions on use of products. I saw a real difference in my daughter's hair in about a week. She is falling in love with her hair for the first time.
"
"
Great for my 4a/4b textured, dry hair. Conditioner is awesome as rinse out, leave in, and detangler. Pricey, but quality product. I find myself reaching for DevaCurl the Most.
"
"
Be careful. I don't think this product is authentic. It has a much different texture than the devacurl products purchased from devacurl and does not work as well. I learned my lesson and will be spending a little extra money to buy from licensed/reputable sources or directly from DevaCurl from now on.
"
"
My husband has course curly hair. He says this is the product he has been looking for his whole life. I have noticed his curls are more healthy looking and shiny when he uses this. It just so unfortunately expensive.
"
"
It seems to work great. My hairdresser recommended this product to bring out fhe curls I didn’t know I had. It is a little on the pricey side though.
"
"
Was super excited to try this set based on reviews and didnt feel that they were worth the price. Ive seen better results with suave professionals than this! Highly recommend the tigi catwalk curl boosting set
"
"
Have used ""no-poo"" in the past. This is a ""low-pow"", so I believe it has some shampoo. Really helps dry hair. Do need the curl gel to put in your hair after, if you want to hold in curls.
"
"
My hairdresser recommended that I get to use for my new perm. They have work so well! My curls are now defined and never frizzy, they bounce better, and the volume is great. I really recommend this for anyone with curly hair
"
"
I loved the shampoo. I was losing handfuls of hair everyday using my old shampoo. I began using this shampoo and noticed a huge difference the first day. I have been using it a couple of weeks now and barely lose hair and it doesn't dry my hair out. I will definitely purchase the shampoo again. The conditioner is ok and probably won't purchase it again.
"
"
I got this for my daughter , she does have curly hair , and she loved it so much they she can’t leave without, makes her her gorgeous .
"
"
Didn't see much difference in this product. Quite expensive for something that I did not notice was better than other products I prefer that are cheaper. Will not purchase this item again :(
"
"
I love this stuff. I feel it has improved my curls. Highly recommend.
"
"
I like the deva products in general. I try others but keep going back to this brand. I have 3b-c curls and the system keeps the frizz down and the style in check during humid georgia wheather.
"
"
Fantastic product!  This product doesn't foam up so no buildup in your hair. The clean and softness you'll get is amazing.
"
"
Works great on my curly gray hair. Friends think I actually work on my hair and that I have “great hair.”  Ha!  I just want hair instead of cotton candy or dryer lint—my norm. Little effort, works great.
"
"
I ordered this product because at work a bottle broke and it smelled amazing ,this one I received stinks so I am returning it. I hate this because i really looked forward to trying it.has anyone else had this experience? I think I got a fake product.
"
"
Great product for my grandsons. Doesn't strip the hair of natural oils.  Helps loose soft curls!!
"
"
This shampoo (and conditioner) has been amazing! I am in the process of growing out my hair after two years of serious, unexplainable hair loss after my last pregnancy. I have tried a ton of products but this one has brought my curly (thin) hair back to life! It is worth the money! I love it!
"
"
This stuff is wonderful for my dry curly hair. The shampoo alone really softens and smooths my hair. I use a clarifying shampoo to remove my product from my hair and then immediately follow up with my no poo decadence. No need for me to use detangling spray!
"
"
Didn’t do anything for my hair and the smell is chemical. My roots looked greasy and my ends were dry
"
"
Love the product, hate the bottles.  I have to take the tops off in order to get anything to come out. Your first squeeze makes a dent in the bottle and the solutions refuse to come out even with shaking.
"
"
I’m not sure about this product, to me the smell of the product was off. My husband even commented on how it smelled like perm solution.
"
"
Use on very dry hair.  It was not harsh and did not strip the hair or remove moisture.  Very good product for natural hair.
"
"
This is a great shampoo and hair conditioner if you want to get off the regular shampoos. It's great for curly hair.
"
"
Greatfor my daughters curly hair.  She’s been getting compliments ever since I purchased this shampoo.  Smells awesome too.
"
"
This stuff is all my daughter will use on her curly hair now! It smells good, too. It's pricey, but it lasts a really long time!
"
"
I've used this before and loved it. Bought the combo, the conditioner did not smell at all like the original. I still had the small size and smelled both, there is no way these are the same thing. I tried using it, and my hair doesn't feel the same. I do not honk the shampoo is original, but not the conditioner.
"
"
Great definition without striping natural oil.
"
"
My hair reacts very different to every thing that I put in it.  I have heard great reviews about this shampoo, but it just did not work for my curly hair
"
"
Product works well on very curly hair, but seems expensive and not too many washings
"
"
Love this product for my wavy/curly hair
"
"
I have mostly straight hair with a bit of wave and a combo of dry and oily scalp. After one washing this cleanser and conditioner have made my hair soft, full, and generally amazing. My only wish is it wasn't so fragrant. I don't like how my hair still smells so strongly of the product.
"
"
Out little girl has very curly hair and this shampoo and conditioner is the only thing we've found that drops the tangles out easily and keeps it looking great.
"
"
Been using  this for a couple of months now, and my wavy frizzy hair is so much more manageable!  Also it smells great!
"
"
can be drying
"
"
Best thing to happen to my curls! It leaves my hair super soft.
"
"
The ""no-poo"" feels more like a conditioner. It leaves my hair even greasier than it was before ""washing"" it. The conditioner is awesome and I love it.
"
"
My hair looks great when I use this product line; however, my scalp gets itchy and scaly.
"
"
Where have you been! Superb Product for Curly Hair!First time use my hair felt wonderfully soft and amazing curls!!!!!
"
"
Arrived completely sealed. No leaks and clean bottles.  This is the right product and it was just what I ordered. I will continue to order from this carrier in the future!  I love this product for my curly hair!
"
"
Great
"
"
This is the only product I will use on my hair.
"
"
Great product for a girl with curly hair.
"
"
Love this stuff! My curls are so bouncy and spiral like crazy. I get a lot of compliments on my hair since I've been using Deva line. Love it!
"
"
Amazing shampoo and conditioner. Best ever
"
"
This product was not for me.  Made my scalp burn and I don't like the smell.  It works for my friend that recommended it to me though.
"
"
I have used these products for over 3 years & they work great on my super curly hair. They smell good & work great. What I received in this order smelled terrible, was awful on my hair and wasn't even the right color in the bottle. Extremely disappointed.
"
"
Smelled absolutely wonderful, but left my hair feeling dry and brittle.
"
"
My hair feels SO soft after using these products!!  I am addicted to this line!  Cleanses and hydrates my curls without weighing them down.  Love love love!!!!
"
"
first time trying devacurl and I like it. I will still probably stick to my more inexpensive products but it was great to try.
"
"
Cleanses hair adequately
"
"
Got this shampoo and conditioner for my granddaughter. It’s amazing stuff
"
"
It dried my hair out so much and gave it a weird feeling.
"
"
Love these products. Conditioner has a strong scent. Nice but better for a woman than a man

I love this product; however, the second bottle of conditioner that I received seemed much thicker than the first.  I had to take the cover off to use it as it wouldn't go through the cap hole.  I recommended the product to a friend and she told me she liked the shampoo, but didn't like the conditioner as it was thick and gave her hair a heavy feel.  Did they change the formula?
"
"
The shampoo smells like Windex. The conditioner smells a generic bar of soap and cheap sunscreen. Maybe these scents are appealing to you. I do not want them in my hair. It seems to clean okay, but my hair is just as poofy as ever.
"
"
Only shampoo and conditioner I will ever use on my hair.  This product is amazing.  I recommend it to all my friends.
"
"
Great price and speedy delivery. The product speaks for itself. Great for curly hair. Makes it soft and shiny and not frizzy!
"
"
Great shampoo and conditioner for curly hair. Cleans hair without stripping and the conditioner is just enough to keep hair silky without weighing it down and helps control the frizz. A little of each goes a long way and the price is right.
"
"
This stuff is great. Helps tame the frizz

This is an edit to my previous review.  When I first bought this set with high hopes, I was unimpressed. I have naturally wavy hair.  It seemed like it was drying my hair out and causing it to be frizzy.  So I stopped using it, moved on to super moisturizing my hair and over the past few months have re-visited devacurl.  Now I'm starting to love it.The shampoo has a very light scent, but the conditioner has a strong earthy smell. I had to get used to this, but now I like it.  After trying it again and using it regularly, I can honestly say that my hair is responding well. The curl is more defined and lasts longer than before.So, if you are unsure, give it a try.  I still think the conditioner needs to be more moisturizing, but they may have one better suited for my needs.  I use this with the devacurl gel, which I love.
"
"
Was using the wen, which was good, but this is better.
"
"
The conditioner is great.  I'm not a big fan of no-poo for my wavier curls.
"
"
Perfect for curly hair!
"
"
I have purchased thee products before and love them. Keeps my hair healthy and soft. Thanks for the awesome price.
"
"
My curls are better than ever w no build up on my scalp
"
"
The smell causes me to reference the air freshener in public restrooms (that fake grapey smell). I'm also not finding that it quenches my curls enough. Works OK as a co-wash.
"
"
It was recommended by a friend and totally love it!!! My so uses it too and likes it too!!! Bonus, it's environmentally friendly!!! Thank you!!
"
"
I love this shampoo and conditioner!!!! I think it even helped my hair grow... HOWEVER! not so great for volume. Since there is hardly any lather while washing hair, you don't really feel like your hair is clean. Also, when I used it with Deval curl light defining gel, my hair was kind off lifeless, the curls where not very spirally, it became tangled very easyly and it my hair iched by the second day. Now, when I didn't add any additional products to my hair, my hair looked so healthy BUT since I need something to keep my curls looking defined and neat, I can't just do shampoo and conditioner. I have recently changed shampoos, because supposedly you have to do it in order to give your hair a break or not get too used to your shampoo (something like that) to the ArtNaturals Argan Oil Hair shampoo and conditioner and I can't wait to switch back to my DEVACURL NO-Poo
"
"
I've been using Deva Curl products for 6 years now and will never go back to anything else. It has made such a huge difference in my thick, curly hair. My curls are defined and not frizzy. I get compliments all the time. Of course, using the full product line and having a good cut is also important.
"
"
Great curls, but I'm hypersensitive to the scent used.  I gave it to my sister who loves.
"
"
Good sulfate free shampoo and silicone free conditioner.  I tend to use One Conditioner as a leave in vs a rinse out.  Unique smell - you either love it or hate it.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Love, love, love.  So glad I found these products and tried everything out there.
"
"
It's ok. With all the raving about it I was wondering if it would really live up to the hype but for me it's just ok.
"
"
Love!!! After chemo my hair grew in curly. I couldn't manage it. Now everyone compliments my curls!!
"
"
Great product! Love them both. I will definitely reorder.  It does wonders for my fine curls with weighing them down.
"
"
price good
"
"
Works and smells great. Luv their products
"
"
Love how this smells and I was shocked at how soft it made my hair. SERIOUSLY soft!  I'll order again.
"
"
Great product for naturally curly hair
"
"
this product is great! makes my hair feel soft
"
"
Very good stuff
"
"
Fav brand of hair produces. Leaves curls bouncy and perfect texture
"
"
I hate it. Both of them. They won’t come out of the bottle. I have to dig the product out!!!
"
"
I have very curly - naturally curly hair.  These products are great.
"
"
Love this product!!!
"
"
I love it!!! A product that is actually true to the name!!!
"
"
I love this product! comb hair with finger, air dry and watch the curls show up..
"
"
Happy with this. Makes my hair really soft.
"
"
This is great product. I would buy it again. Leaves my hair clean and soft. Great for tangles.
"
"
Honestly, it didn't work on my hair. I have very thick, coarse curly hair and I thought it would make my curls more manageable, but it did not. However, I loved the smell.
"
"
This is the only time in my life when ""no poo"" is a really good thing. The no poo ""shampoo"" does amazing things for even my crummy hair.
"
"
I literally stop to tell curly haired strangers of the DevaCurl miracle.
"
"
nice product
"
"
Don't care for the product line
"
"
I really love these products for my and my 4 year old daughter’s hair. I have curly, high porosity and fine color-treated hair and my daughter has thick, low porosity, wavy/curly hair. Both or hair is on the drier side right now due to dry cold in the Northeast.  Since we starting using Devacurl both our curl patterns have improved significantly. I also do not feel the need to wash my hair everyday since I started using this line of products because it’s easy to fix my curls each morning with water and alittle bit of added product. They also smell awesome. I would definitely recommend this line to anyone with curly hair. I had used this line a few years back and changed products to try something new that my salon offered but, I don’t think I’ll be straying again!
"
"
Best products ever!!
"
"
Love the No-Poo Shampoo & conditioner as well as the gel!
"
"
Love the way it makes my hair feel.  Love the scent also.
"
"
This really dried out my 3a curls. They became limp and super frizzy. I have fine hair that forms banana curls.
"
"
I like these products.  Just wish it smelled better.
"
"
The consistency of the conditioner is thin and watery, much different from what I've purchased at a salon previously. I had to mix it with some leftover conditioner I had in order to make it somewhat useable-- needless to say, I probably won't purchase it again from this seller. This is my first time using the low-poo and it seems to feel like what I'd expect a shampoo to feel like, it doesn't dry out my hair at all. I'd buy this again.
"
"
These shampoo is definitely the best product I ever used.
"
"
Dries my hair little peanut brittle
"
"
love this product
"
"
This shampoo/conditioner combo has been great for my hair. It has added moisture and defined my curls. I will definitely be ordering more.
"
"
created too much build up :-(
"
"
My item arrived broken and spilled in box
"
"
Great for curly hair!
"
"
Love the product
"
"
My hair really is way curlier, and i just have wavy hair normally.  I love it! Such interesting, tight ringlets!
"
"
If you have curly hair and haven't tried Deva Curl products yet, you are missing out! Adds moisture to dry locks without weighing them down. This combo in particular is perfect for medium coarse to slightly coarse hair. I find that the Heaven in Hair conditioner works better for coarser, drier hair. But the whole Deva line is great and affordable for high quality products. Their website has a bunch of useful tips for curly heads too, especially  if you're having a hard time figuring out which product will work for your particular type of curls.Also, sulfate free, paraben free, and smells great but not too perfumey.
"
"
Smells great, keeps the curls and reduces fizz. Personally I like the shampoo much more than the conditioner. Sticking with this!
"
"
Oh my gosh this is the best hair care product!!!!
"
"
If you have natural wave or curl, this is a good shampoo and conditioner to put on it.  I started using it after my stylist used it on my hair.  Since then there are a lot more curly care products out there but this is still a staple for me.
"
"
This shampoo is absolutely amazing. It's completely transformed my hair. It has made my curls much more defined and manageable. Definitely recommend for anyone with curly hair.
"
"
Have been using these product and the system for about a month now and I have noticed a big change in how my curls stay and without the need of a ton of gel during the humid summer! Do not expect suds from the shampoo, it is a no-poo, it does not make bubbles. I am using a little more than what I use of regular shampoo per wash, but that might be the getting used to the no suds. So far, I am happy with the product and the system outlined in the book.
"
"
I liked it but it wasn't sealed and that bothered me
"
"
This worked but I think my hair favors the One line.
"
"
I like it good, the poo is very low. Would give it five stars but that seems like a lot. The end.
"
"
I really like these products, I have been using them for over one year and I plan on continuing.
"
"
Great shampoo and conditioner for my wavy/curly thick hair. Awesome value.
"
"
Great price be fast delivery!
"
"
absolutely love this product!
"
"
My favorite shampoo and conditioner!
"
"
Great Product, works great.
"
"
If you curly hair these are thr best products to use. Love, Love, Love them!
"
"
Have only use this product once so far but I'm hooked. I had been using another brand cleansing conditioner product for a few years. I enjoyed the softness of my hair but my curls lacked definition. I used the devacurl no poo and condition one with the styling gel and allowed my hair to air dry. I woke up this am to amazing defined curls. I had forgot my hair was this curl. It's soft and shiny with none of the frizz I had before. It's like a new head of hair all together. I encourage all curly haired girls to try this. It's super easy to use and amazing. I will continue to use this product!
"
"
Great product fr curls
"
"
Product works nice with hair but I am not a fan of the smell. Boyfriend seems to love it though.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Makes my hair a little bit dry.
"
"
Wonderful! We love it! My daughter has very curly hair and these products make it easier to manage while leaving beautiful conditioned curls.  Highly recommend it!
"
"
Love this hair product. My hair is always soft afterwards and the fragrance is so nice.
"
"
A great product for people with naturally curly hair
"
"
Best product for curly hair. Does not dry out hair, keep curls soft and manageable.
"
"
Second purchase if these products!  They work great with my curly, salt and pepper hair!
"
"
Best product!
"
"
Thought I ordered the no-poo and one conditioner. The result is not the same.
"
"
Love this brand.  This duo was a great buy.
"
"
Product smells bad
"
"
works great. Love it
"
"
During the first shampoo, a golf ball size of hair came out during the shower, and that has never happened to me before. I have wavy, thick Caucasian hair. I have had straight perms, and this stuff smells like that chemical relaxer. After I got out of the shower, my scalp burned a little, and I got freaked out, so I re-washed and conditioned my hair with my usual stuff immediately. I won’t use this again. I don’t know, maybe it’s expired or counterfeit product. I was so excited to try, but I’ll never use it again.
"
"
Great find!! Absolutely loved it!
"
"
Doesn't do a great job of cleaning hair.
"
"
Literally life changing. My curls are so much better.
"
"
Love it, and its animal testing free!!
"
"
Great product, really improved my curls by hydrating them.
"
"
Awesome product. You will notice and feel the difference instantaneuosly! and it only takes a very small amount to make it happen. Be sure to massage your scalp very well when using the cleaner shampoo and for the conditioner use only on the ends of your hair.....Plan to buy this product again and again
"
"
smells ok, probably works great, but I had to use so much of the shampoo to get my hair clean that investing in this as a daily shampoo would be cost prohibitive (and yes, I have to wash my hair daily or it is disgusting). The conditioner doesn't really do much for my hair. After a few days, the set makes my hair somewhat flat. There are products at the drugstore that work just as well, if not better.
"
"
Very disappointed I'm out of my return range time. I wanted to finish my current 32 ounce I had just opened before opening this one. When I opened it, it smelled like nail acrylics. The color appeared similar but the smell is horrific. What a total waste of money for a phoney product. Deva curl work amazing for curly hair and this was NOT devacurl
"
"
I like these two products for my curly hair. It gives my hair more spiral than most shampoos and conditioners. It leaves my hair with a softer feeling than most. I like the smell just fine. It doesn't feel the best when you put it in your hair, but leave the conditioner in just a minute or two and it does well. I am a white female with very thin (individual hairs), that are kind of fluffy.  It helps control my hair.
"
"
I don't usually write reviews -  only if I feel very strongly about a product one way or the other. Well this product is truly awful. It actually does the opposite of what it says it does. Deva Curl left my hair dry, frizzy, and out-of-control. On top of that it left my scalp itchy and actually left flakes in my hair. I wanted to give it a chance so I tried it for three days in a row but I just couldn't use it another day . . . I was so unhappy with the way it left my hair.
"
"
To be fair, I really haven't given the No-poo Shampoo a fair chance to assess it's value as a curly hair shampoo. I simply cannot stand the smell which is so much like Ponds cold cream and it totally turns me off. The One Condition Conditioner has a nicer lighter fragrance and I have continued to use it.
"
"
Really good shampoo even though it says ""no suds"" it actually foams-up, my hair squeeks when rinsed clean, smells refreshing not over powering or like perfume. The conditioner is amazing, its light and leaves my hair really soft and my curls (3C super fine)  coil with less frizz! I use it as a leave-in. Its pricy, but I dont have thick long hair, so it last long for curl natural wash-n-go.
"
"
I love this product. My naturally curly hair is so thankful! I have tried numerous products that were not good for my hair. I was impressed with the moisture retention. I was also impressed with the quality of the product. I would recommend this product to anyone with curly hair.
"
"
I am a male with curly hair. This is the ONLY product I have used that will help tame them and not leave me with a frizzed out afro. That said, I really wish there was an option so I didnt literally smell like roses following using the conditioner.
"
"
Works great! Because I was using sulfate shampoo before this, it took a few days to build up in my hair, but now that it has my hair is non-frizzy, soft, and curls beautifully. I have thin curly hair from the German side of my family, so usually products for curls weigh mine down too much. But my curls are bouncy and well defined, and no trace of stickiness! I will definitely be reordering.
"
"
awesome for curly hair. Makes your hair silky. The only  thing that helps with my frizzy hair.
"
"
Can't get used to no suds. Leaves hair feeling greasy.
"
"
love
"
"
OMG, I cannot believe what an incredible difference this makes in my curls. I was VERY skeptical when I was initially told about it but figured I would give it a try.  I have tried hundreds of other products/combinations to get the most out of my curls and just figured my hair was no longer as curly as it used to be.The Lo-poo gives just enough suds.  The conditioner is not too heavy for my wavy/curly hair.I cannot not stress this enough.....THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!!!  Pricey but soooo worth it.  I use it with the ultra defining gel. I got my best friend to try it next.  Can't wait to see how incredible her hair will look!
"
"
IDK what it does but the wife loves it
"

Not good

To start off, I have relaxed hair, and my natural hair is soft and slightly kinky.My hair dresser (hair dresser in the cold climate) recommended this product to me when I move from a warm humid climate to a cold dry one. In the new climate my hair started  to feel thin so I thought, why not try it. At first it made my hair felt fuller, but the ends still felt brittle. After the second wash my scalp started to itch after 3-4 days. I then tried using the No-Poo along with a dandruff shampoo to get rid of the itch.During the 3-4 weeks that I used this product it just made my scalp itchy and irritated. My sister and I then looked up a reason for why it was irritating my scalp. Bottom line was that the No-Poo was trying to remove the layer of elements that regular sampoo leaves on your scalp to keep it healthy and then replace it with it's own later of minerals (which I'm sure would keep your scalp itch if it didn't irriate it). All of this irritated the hell out of me and I stopped using both the No-Poo and conditioner. About three weeks later my hair started coming out more when I washed it, and the ends we're thinned out (the second part might of been because of my hair dresser's Brazilian blowout hair drying technique --side note, that can pull out your hair--)I would never recommend this product to someone, for one, I almost feel like the product needs a warning label, or some kind of recommendation for what hair types can use it.
"
"
I love this kit. I have type 4 a/b tightly coiled curly hair. It can be hard to tame. I love the noo poo, conditioner, coconut styler, and set spray. It isn't too heavy like other products can be. It does not sit on top of the hair. It really penetrates moisture. My curls are always soft and never dry/brittle.
"
"
It makes my curly hair feel soft. Sometimes I'm not sure how well it cleans my scalp over an extended amount of time. I'd probably do this most of the time with a break with a good shampoo to get rid of built up oils.
"
"
Does not change hair color and leaves hair like u just paid for a $200.00 conditioning treatment at a spa!
"
"
My stylist advised me to try Devacurl no-poo.  I have fine, straight hair.  Is this product only for curly hair?
"
"
I love this product. You really should buy it from your Stylist but I was desperate and Amazon saved the day.  Beware of fake products!  This was the real deal though!
"
"
Typically use this after a shower, mixed with a bit of oil. I let my hair air dry and t adds natural bounce to my wavy/curly hair.Also regularly use as a touch up throughout the day. Love it
"
"
Warning.... not CG approved!!!
"
"
If you have wavy or curly hair this product is essential for you. It refreshes your curl and holds the natural wave or curl.This light moisture spray calms down the frizziest curly hair problems that occur when wind and rain, or dry hot weatherplays with the natural moisture in your hair.
"
"
Works ok. For the price it wasn’t great
"
"
I love ALL Diva products.  This one helps to keep the moisture in your hair.  The smell is so clean and fresh and doesn't weigh my fine thin hair down.
"
"
I like using this between washes. It revitalizes my curls. Great smell.
"
"
My favorite hair care product for my naturally curly hair. Have sworn by it for years.
"
"
I have coarse curly wavy hair. The curls have different tightness randomly on my head. Didn’t experience anything special with this spray. Used it after I styled as normal and even sprayed and styled with my hair wet.
"
"
I use this product mainly for my roots.

I have mildly curly hair and live by DEVA products.

I have thin hair, but lovely curls. This product really bring out definition and eliminates frizz without weighing my hair down and making it look thinner than it is, as other products I have tried. I use it in combination with Leave In Conditioner by Curl Friends.
"

Hair looks greasy and dirty after i apply this product even when it's freshly washed
"

This spray is a curl saver!  Next day hair,  just spray and run fingers through to smooth

Spray really helps tame frizziest curls

Makes my hair curly,untangled and soft.
"
"
I Love this product.  I use it  all the  time...Having curly  hair, it makes it so easy to keep it from getting frizzy!!  And there is noresidue, so it leaves your  hair soft and shiny!!
"
"
This product is great to revive curls in between washes.  I've been shampooing less to preserve color and I read that curly hair tends to be dryer so we shouldn't shampoo daily.  Works for me!
"
"
This product made  did not work for me. It seemed to dry out my hair and did not help with the Friz.
"
"
Highly recommended for curly hair!
"
"
love devacurl but I'm not sure how they can make a product that isnt curly girl method. sigh.
"
"
This is the hairspray for curly hair. Great hold. Limits frizz, not crunchy!
"
"
İ like it
"
"
I do not like the smell
"
"
The only thing that could improve this product for me is a bigger bottle.  This is for people to need to add some weight to their hair and reduce frizz.
"
"
I've loved all the deva curl products I've tried so far except for this one. It does not do anything for your curls but make them a big, knotty mess. If  you want dreads, this is for you.
"
"
Good product. I tend to use it on my second day curls that need help reshaping or for a little extra moisture after the shower on humid days. It's light and doesn't stiffen hair
"
"
Get this item immediately! It is AMAZING at tanning frizz and really helps my curls stay beautiful till wash day. I have looked for a product for years that could get rid of my frizzies and definitely highly recommend it. I have super thick hair with medium size curls.
"
"
The original product was damaged in the mail but a replacement was sent right away.  Not sure why but they had me return the original package that was leaking (bottles had been smashed) but I did so and apologized profusely to the people that returned it.
"
"
Works well for my hair,  sets my waves and curls nicely but after a few days or immediately depending on how much you use,  there will be a little sticky residue felt on the hair.
"
"
So... I just started to come to terms with my curls and this product is absolutely a must have if you want well defined curls without the crustiness of gel!
"
"
This is my favorite finishing spray. I have curly/wavy hair and it gets dry and frezzie. This product takes the wildness. I really love this product. This is my second time ordering it from Amazon and my third time buying it in general. Great product!
"
"
I think they changed the formula in this product.  The trial set I had used previously was awesome.  I was a little disappointed in the new version..  Not the same quality and results I was looking for.
"
"
Love this product! Great fro setting my curls to prevent frizz and great fro refreshing
"
"
Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas as she uses Deva Curl products.  She loves all of the products for her extremely curly, curly dry and frizzy hair.
"
"
Leaves my hair looking Great!
"
"
very good moisturizer for curly hair and helpful in styling it in the mornings when I am in a rush
"
"
I love this oroduct! Works so well to moisturize & refresh my curls.
"
"
Love the smell!
"
"
Since discovering DevaCurl I use their products almost exclusively. This is a great product but it takes some getting used to. It isn't a gel, is more like a cream or lotion consistency. Great for shaping curls.
"
"
This helps control my naturally curly hair in the hot, humid summer months.
"
"
Good to revive your hair.
"
"
just as ordered. this is one of my fav products.
"
"
I'm not a fan of the ""Set It Free Moisture Spray"".  It made my hair feel greasy and heavy.  Didn't work for me.
"
"
Have used nothing but Deva for 8 years! Never going back.
"
"
Works for my sorta-curly curls, once the ends frizz I use this to get them looking good again.
"
"
BEWARE!! This product is FAKE!!! It came opened and the original product is a thick green conditioner mask, this stuff is white and chunky and smells like NAIR!!! OUTRAGEOUS that Amazon allows for vendors to sale fake products. Super unhappy. I hope someone reaches out and makes this right.
"
"
Last summer I bought this mask despite the reviews which said that it was a fake product. I bought it and loved it but it was my first time trying it and I was still wondering if it was authentic.  So since I was running out and I loved the mask, I decided to repurchase but this time from Devacurl's site.  The mask I bought in Devacurl looks the same, feels the same, smells the same and works the same as the one I bought las year in Amazon, so I'm confident to say it is authentic. My baby-fine, low porosity, 2c-3a hair LOVES it so much, it is my very favorite hair mask and believe me when I tell you I've tried them all!
"
"
I purchased this in Oct 2017 and only used it a couple of times. It made my hair so completely unmanageable with horrible texture and tangles. I final ordered a sample from the DevaCurl website, and realized that the real stuff actually works! As much as I liked to save a few dollars ordering the products from Amazon, it's not worth the damage from counterfeit products in this case.
"
"
Wow what an expensive product and it doesn't even provide enough moisture or slip to detangle and such little product I ran out after just 5 or 7 washes or so. I much much much prefer Shea moisture masks those come in bigger sizes for way cheaper n many of them are extremely hydrating n provide great slip....I had to use sooo much product to get any hydration and slip and even then not enough. This is probably best for hair that is in excellent condition but curly hair even virgin is dry so really who this is for I can't tell maybe very very fine curly hair but if u have thick curly hair that needs moisture look elsewhere and save your $ as this won't cut it whatsoever.
"
"
My hair is very thin, I color it every year, and blow dry it every day so I get split ends, breakage, and brittle hair! This matcha butter conditioning mask save my hair. Love its smell and it did a great job to moisturize and repair my damaged hair. It brings my dead hair back to life, my hair start to become silky and shiny again!
"
"
Love Love this over shea moisture masks!!! I will never buy shea moisture masks again!!
"
"
Im one of the percentage of ppl who just comes back to leave a review if the product DIDNT work!!! This product did the opposite to my hair, after using it my hair was dry , rough didn’t help to untangle my hair . I had a hard time in the shower when i used it. And since my hair was more tangled after applying this mask, i tried washing it off with my regular shampoo and conditioner and it was hard for the conditioner to do it’s job .
"
"
I thought I would love the DevaCurl brand vs lower end products, but was wrong.Does it get the job done? - YesCan I get the same results for more than half the price? - YesCurrently using and loving Shea Moisture's Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Mask along with a weekly treatment of Shea Moisture's Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate & Repair Intensive Protein Treatment.

I love DevaCurl products and they made my hair look and feel amazing.  Unfortunately, I am severely allergic to something in the DevaCurl products.  When I use this product on my hair, it burns my scalp like acid.  Afterwards, my scalp began to break out with a rash and severe itching. I stopped using the product and my scalp has gotten better but not completely healed.  This has resulted in a substantial about of money spent going to the doctor and on prescription for shampoo, pills and creams.  Also, I had the same problem when I purchased from Ulta and when I purchased on Amazon.

This mask smells like a tropical vacation. I kept telling my husband that. So deliciously good! And not strong at all. It has an almost gel-ish/creamy consistency. It goes on smoothly on the hair. The smell is not overpowering once you have it in your hair. I usually leave it on overnight for the extra moisture. When it’s time to rinse is out, it comes off instantly, as if it were never on your hair - no greasy residue. It gives great moisture and shine to my curls. I LOVE!!!’

BEWARE!! This product is FAKE!!! It came opened and the original product is a thick green conditioner mask, this stuff is white and chunky and smells like NAIR!!! OUTRAGEOUS that Amazon allows for vendors to sale fake products. Super unhappy. I hope someone reaches out and makes this right.
"
"
Last summer I bought this mask despite the reviews which said that it was a fake product. I bought it and loved it but it was my first time trying it and I was still wondering if it was authentic.  So since I was running out and I loved the mask, I decided to repurchase but this time from Devacurl's site.  The mask I bought in Devacurl looks the same, feels the same, smells the same and works the same as the one I bought las year in Amazon, so I'm confident to say it is authentic. My baby-fine, low porosity, 2c-3a hair LOVES it so much, it is my very favorite hair mask and believe me when I tell you I've tried them all!
"
"
I purchased this in Oct 2017 and only used it a couple of times. It made my hair so completely unmanageable with horrible texture and tangles. I final ordered a sample from the DevaCurl website, and realized that the real stuff actually works! As much as I liked to save a few dollars ordering the products from Amazon, it's not worth the damage from counterfeit products in this case.
"
"
Wow what an expensive product and it doesn't even provide enough moisture or slip to detangle and such little product I ran out after just 5 or 7 washes or so. I much much much prefer Shea moisture masks those come in bigger sizes for way cheaper n many of them are extremely hydrating n provide great slip....I had to use sooo much product to get any hydration and slip and even then not enough. This is probably best for hair that is in excellent condition but curly hair even virgin is dry so really who this is for I can't tell maybe very very fine curly hair but if u have thick curly hair that needs moisture look elsewhere and save your $ as this won't cut it whatsoever.
"

My hair is very thin, I color it every year, and blow dry it every day so I get split ends, breakage, and brittle hair! This matcha butter conditioning mask save my hair. Love its smell and it did a great job to moisturize and repair my damaged hair. It brings my dead hair back to life, my hair start to become silky and shiny again!
"
"
Love Love this over shea moisture masks!!! I will never buy shea moisture masks again!!
"
"
Im one of the percentage of ppl who just comes back to leave a review if the product DIDNT work!!! This product did the opposite to my hair, after using it my hair was dry , rough didn’t help to untangle my hair . I had a hard time in the shower when i used it. And since my hair was more tangled after applying this mask, i tried washing it off with my regular shampoo and conditioner and it was hard for the conditioner to do it’s job .
"
"
I thought I would love the DevaCurl brand vs lower end products, but was wrong.Does it get the job done? - YesCan I get the same results for more than half the price? - YesCurrently using and loving Shea Moisture's Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Mask along with a weekly treatment of Shea Moisture's Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate & Repair Intensive Protein Treatment.

I just received this today. Initial review after the first use is not good. This went on smoothly, felt really nice, and smelled pretty good. I left it on for about 15 minutes and when I went to wash it out, I noticed that my hair felt like straw. I rinsed and attempted to comb, my hair had knotted horribly from this product. I have really fine, dry, curly hair, so using Devacurls description, this would be the one for me. I will attempt to use again and update if there is a change. All in all, this product did not do what it says it will.
"
"
My stylist used this on me and this stuff is simply amazing! (For my kinky-coily natural girls): my hair texture is a mixture of 3c in the front and some 4a/b textures in the back). I like the scent (it’s not too strong)... and although it’s pricey a little goes a long way with this product. The price with this seller is better than any in-store I’ve seen.
"
"
Best conditioner I've ever used, hands down.Love my DevaCurl products but this has to be my favorite. I'm an African American woman with natural hair, probably 3C/4A
"
"
I've now bought two of these for my curly hair and find that it makes a huge difference in keeping my hair soft and reducing the number of times per year I need to trim my ends.
"
"
Reading these reviews I was concerned that this product was a fake. It behaves identically to what DevaCurl sells and I've been using theirs for years. Next order will be the larger size for even greater savings. Happy.
"
"
I got this product at the start of my curly journey. This product is marketed as a deep conditioner, but when i used it my hair never felt moisturized. It felt really dry.I always felt as if i needed to condition it again after using it. I did NOT like this product. I folowed the directions and attempted to use it 4 or 5 times because this was supposed to be a great quality product and was not cheap by any means.
"
"
DevaCurl is by far the best leave in curl conditioner I have ever used! This product brings my wild curly hair to life, no frizz, perfect everyday curls!  It smells like I just left the salon and looks like it too! The only thing that I found an issue is it leaves a slight greasy appearance after use. Leaves my curls silky and bouncy! Love this stuff, not to mention the cost on here is so much better than at your typical beauty store.
"
"
This is the best hair mask I have ever used !! I even use it sometimes on a daily basis as a conditioner. Makes your hair silky smooth like butter !! I have fine chemically treated blonde hair and it doesn’t weigh it down !!
"
"
I would normally say the price was a little high but it works! I want to get one of the other products from this company. Your hair feels so soft when you use it.
"
"
Deva curl has only been such a satisfaction, but this specific product only caused dry, brittle hair. It was very difficult to de tangle. This caused me to pull out a lot of hair and cause breakage. I really would like to return it but I missed the dead line thinking giving the product time to work would help my hair adjust to it. It has a very strong chemical smell and just layers more on your hair then moisturizes. I end up having to use a large amount of my one conditioner to de tangle  my hair. All in all ruining my hair, wasting my product that I love from deva and preventing me from truly caring for my hair. Very disappointed. Definitely had high expectations.
"
"
This conditioner is  unbelievable and leaves my hair moisturized, soft to the touch. I use it as a deep conditioner and as a leave in on my natural curly hair to keep it moisturized.
"
"
Love this product. The expense is quite much though. Curly haired girls like myself have a LOT of hair and a company that doesn’t prioritize the experience and necessity of larger sized products for the same price just don’t sit well in my mind. The smell is eh, but the product is very nourishing.
"
"
This adds so much moisture to my hair and makes it feel and look so much healthier. I really love it. I apply it in the shower before I start washing my body and so it has time to sit in my hair then wash it out at the end of the shower. It's great. :)
"
"
AMAZING! One of my favorite purchases for my hair! It allows me to have daily moisture. Great price for so much. My hair feels and smells better than when I use other leave in conditioners. I wish I had found this before.
"
"
Great moisturizer but the devacurl line made my scalp itch really bad.
"
"
I used this on my 4A/B fine hair. It has a luxe feel going on and a great, fresh scent. The moisture left as soon as I washed it out. My hair was very dry the next day. It was returned.
"
"
Beware. This product will do the opposite of what it says it does. My hair knotted up so bad after using this that my daughter had to cut giant clumps of knots out of my hair. Made it feel like straw. Do not use anything by DevaCurl. This absolutely will mess up your hair.
"
"
Based on other reviews I had high hopes for this conditioner but it didn’t work for me.  It left my hair feeling rough and def didn’t help my curls.
"
"
This product really helped tame my curls and added so much moisture back into my hair! I use a small amount weekly as a leave in conditioner. I will buy again.
"
"
My hair LOVES this conditioner. I have tried every deep conditioner you can find in a beauty store and none of them even came close to this one. It leaves my hair so soft and moisturized. It's definitely worth the money. I'm not crazy about the matcha smell but it's not overpowering or anything.
"
"
This ""moisture"" product DESTROYED my hair. I experienced extreme hair loss and my hair was excessively dry following use. DO NOT USE this product.
"
"
The price has increased by almost double.It may have been worth it when it was under 40$ a bottle but not anymore.That being said, after use my hair feels great and looks great. Adds moisture and does what it needs to but at that price I could buy better products than just this.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Over night, super soft hair; in shower not completely rinsed out, bouncy happy curl all day
"
"
This makes my hair feel like I’m brushing through butter! Its so smooth after using this. I leave it on all night and rinse it out in the morning.
"
"
Love this product. It smells amazing and leaves my hair super moisturized and soft. Definitely has made a big difference with my hair definition.
"
"
This stuff is AMAZING!  Best deep conditioning mask out there for curly hair!  One use and you see a difference.
"
"
brought my hair back to life
"
"
Love this!! My new favorite deep conditioner! Smells amazing! Not too thick or too thin. Goes on really good.  Hair feels so good afterward.  Will buy again!
"
"
Great product that brings out the waviness in my hear when I let my hair air dry. Really a good product!
"
"
This is a great hair mask. I have curly hair and it does wonders for my hair
"
"
Very moisturing.
"
"
Love this product, can be used as a quick conditioning treatment or overnight. I finally tried over night and loved the rest. My hair has never felt better.
"
"
It doesn't leave my hair as moisturized I would've liked. But once I style my hair looks great!
"
"
My has been using the devaCurl products for over a year and love them.
"
"
Good
"
"
Did not work
"
"
Got me zero moisturize...not worth the money. I threw it away.
"
"
My hair lives this product!!
"
"
Works really well for taming and smoothing my curly hair. I use it twice a week and it makes my hair so soft and silky. The smell is also really nice
"
"
Buen producto
"
"
Absolutely love this stuff my hair has transformed
"
"
Not fake!!
"
"
YESSSSSS finally a product I can use on my daughters thick long curly hair. I will be ordering more.
"
"
This mask is AMAZING, your curly hair will thank you
"
"
Deva curl you can't never go wrong
"
"
Moisture, moisture, moisture!
"
"
Pricey, but works well.
"
"
Gives my curls lots of noisture
"
"
Smells really nice, kind of a sweet scent.  It’s a super buttery texture unlike any other hair mask I’ve used. It left my wavy hair super soft and moisturized.
"
"
Doesn't really do anything special for my hair, and is not worth the price.
"
"
I have fine hair, and this is AMAZING....
"
"
Didnt notice anything different than any other conditioners I have used
"
"
Rejuvenates your hair and gives it Volume and curl definition..Worth every PENNY.
"
"
Awesome product...I apply heat the keep it in overnight ... My hair loves Deva products....it is super expensive though.
"
"
I don’t know what happen with this product, I bought it because have amazing reviews for curly hair, I used it and my hair is more deyer, I can’t dictangel may hair and I lose a lot of hair while I was using it.
"
"
Delicious mix. Made my hair softer and with a wonderful smell.
"
"
It's thick and I love the smell and it does what I bought it to do: moisturize my crazy curly hair.  That's about all, folks.  Buy it.  Worth the money.
"
"
This is a decent hair mask but there are better ones out there, especially considering the price. Smells really good though!
"
"
didnt do much for my 4B coarse hair. Heaven in Hair is better
"
"
I was able to wear this overnight and when I washed it out the next day my hair was so soft and it was really easy to style.
"
"
Do not purchase, the product arrived today and the container was half empty.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
wonderful products- too expensive
"
"
Perfect companion to deep sea repair --use together --works wonders
"
"
Works great!
"
"
Ordered from here. It's not fake!Excellent product.
"
"
This is fabulous stuff.  Makes my hair feel soft.
"
"
My hair loves it
"
"
Very good product
"
"
Left my Hair really soft! I love it.
"
"
My new favorite hair mask. Brings my curls back to life.
"
"
My  hairdresser  recommended  this  for  my  mixed race 3b Botticelli curls but I don't  like.  It  makes  my  scalp  itch  and  my  hair  feels  straw  like.  I've  tried  it  both  as a leave  in  and  I've  washed  it  out.  Waste of  money  for  me.
"
"
Excellent conditioner!!!
"
"
Worked wonders on curls that were dried out from hair coloring.  I finger curled with a dab on each.  My hair :  3b/c,  medium density, moderate porosity.  It will become a staple.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 starts is because it does feel heavy as a leave in, even using a small amount.  Kinda feels like I am wearing a hat.
"
"
I used this once and threw it away. My fine curly hair felt damaged for days after I used it. Tangled, dry, less curly. I use some of the Deva Curl products on a regular basis, but this one is horrible. Any drugstore conditioner is 100 times better than this ridiculous ‘‘matcha butter’.
"
"
Love love love ! Deva Curl you never fail me !
"
"
I did not purchase my products from Amazon, I purchased from an authorized retailer, but they aren’t posting my review so I am posting here too. DO NOT buy devacurl products! I have lost probably 1/3 at least of my hair from these products, my hair is damaged, it hardly curls anymore, my scalp was itchy/burning and I had a major dandruff problem while using these products. A simple google search will show you the controversy going on currently with devacurl. Don’t waste your money and don’t risk this happening to you! I believe at one time their products were good and that’s why the reviews are mostly good, but something has changed with their products and they aren’t what they used to be. Their reviews should reflect these changes. There is a current class action lawsuit forming against them for the damage they’ve caused to at least tens of thousands of people. Probably more. Don’t risk it happening to you too!
"
"
Before you purchase this product look into the current class action lawsuit against Deva Curl regarding ALL of their products. Save yourself the  heartache, hair loss and damage. Take 5 min to look on YouTube to see what is happening to other users.
"
"
Didn’t buy mine from amazon but still wanted to come on here and say this is hands down the BEST thing to ever happen to my hair. Got a trial size at Sephora and use as conditioner every time I wash my hair for the last 5 months and my hair is incredibly soft and has completely changed. Also the bottle is huge you don’t need much each use.
"
"
This seems to be the same formula as their Heaven in Hair, which was awful. I love their products, the ones I’ve used. I haven’t tried the seaweed repair one.I will never use this mask again. My hair was dry and brittle and tangled!
"
"
Melt into Moisture does just that: my hair gets very dry but after using MIM it is very soft. I've left it on all day, not just over night, and my curls love it!
"
"
I needed a moisture product like this one and the price is reasonable.  I wash my hair everyday, blow dry, hot irons regularly.  This product gives my hair shine, manageability and fullness without frizz.  I recommend trying it.
"
"
My hair is dry brittle and damaged because of traveling and using hotel shampoo and conditioner way to long. I purchased this item in the hope it would restore my hair and rewind my bad choices. I opened the bottle and I felt my noise was assaultes by a perfume store. The smell was so overwehemling I had to sit down. My stomach is still upside down from the smell. I have a very sensitive noise when it comes to smell. I wish I knew this product would be like that because I wouldn't have purchased it. The product is a greenish color amlost like a face mask color and consistency. I used the item as instructed. My hair feels amazing! It feels silky smooth with amazing body. Unfortunately i will not buy this item again because of the overwhelming smell. This is such an amazing product but wow I can't get over my migraine from it.
"
"
This product has to be fake. The real dea is a sea foam green and also $36

I have always had curly, frizzy hair.  I began using other devacurl products about 3 years ago, however just discovered this butter.  It makes a world of difference!  The product recommends 3 possible ways of using this:  a) shampoo and leave in overnight, rinse in morning; b) shampoo and leave in for up to 20 minutes, then rinse; or c) shampoo and leave in for 3 minutes.  I have found that the first way (overnight) gives the best results in remoisturizing the hair.
"

I have been a loyal Deva Curl client for five years! I loved their products, techniques, and even get the DevaCut. I used to love how my hair looked and felt with the products. Even when the change of ownership came and their products started to get marked up, I figured it’s still worth it. Then, for the past few months especially, I’ve noticed changes in my hair and scalp. I had been using the same products for years, no-poo shampoo, one condition, styling cream, believe-in, and ultra defining gel or the arc-angel gel. However, my scalp became itchier and itchier, dryer and dryer, and now I have dandruff I can’t get rid of. What’s worse, is my hair! It became dryer and coarser. The worse it got the more products I used and the more I washed it. I tried different techniques and brushing it differently. Always slept with a silk pillowcase AND silk bonnet. Then I figured I should get DevaCurl’s Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask. It just made things worse. My hair shed to new extremes, making my hair look flat and thin, my scalp got worse with dry patches that felt tight and hard. My hair was so dry and coarse even after washing my hair, at the end of the day it was matted. Keep in mind I have 3A/B curls, it takes quite a bit to have it matted. not tangled, MATTED. Which of corse meant I had to wash it more, and brushing through it made it fall out more! My curls werent taking shape like they used to. My curls looked more like matted, dry, haystacks that slightly waved. My scalp became sensitive to brushing, it was a nightmare! I stopped using DevaCurl in just a week and I’ve noticed a huge difference already. My curls haven’t fully recovered, but I’m hopeful they will. I will not buy DevaCurl again unless they address this and change to fix the issue. So disappointed, five years of spending money one overpriced products and this is how they repay me. I honestly just want them to go back to how they used to be.
"
"
Don’t waste your money on this. I’ve tried this 3 times on separate occasions & found that when detangling your hair with this, it isn’t great- not much slip. But once you’re done detangling & let it sit in your hair, it’s smooth when you wash it out with running water, but once it’s out of your hair, it’s worse than tangled/wet Barbie doll hair! Finger combing is impossible with this, you have to use a brush, but guaranteed that brush will be filled with your hair. I just spent over 2 hours trying to detangling my 3a/b bra strap length hair & lost a significant amount of hair just trying to detangle with a brush. In comparison, I use Shea butter’s Jamaican castor oil line up & it doesn’t take more than 15 minutes to detangle my hair in the shower. Every time I use this product, I instantly regret it when I detangle my hair. I can’t tell you how close I came to just cry at the sheer frustration I’ve experienced finger combing & brushing my hair in the shower & out the shower with this (you’re just creating more knots). I always have to bring out my trusty “knot today” leave in which instantly provides the slip I need to quickly detangle my hair WITHOUT PULLING HAIR OUT!
"
"
My hair did not do well with this product. I have 3B hair type. Soft curls but they go all around (spiral).  I did not feel the softness. I actually felt my hair like dry straw as I was rinsing it out.  Love Deva Curl product but not their conditioners.
"
"
So far, i like it. I used this and the seaweed repair together. I just did the same amount of both finger-combed it through my hair and then rinsed out completely. My curls looked more defined and so far I am pleased with the product. I exclusively use DevaCurl products. I use the No Poo, One Condition, B'Leavin, Ultra Hold Gel. And on occasion, when my hair needs it i use the Micellar Cleansing thingy, and now I will be using the Deep Sea Repair and Matcha Butter Conditioning Mask on a regular basis but as needed. I also use the hairspray occasionally and I use the No Poo dry shampoo cleanser.
"
"
So I got a really generous sample size of this in my ipsy subscription bag and I fell in love, I don’t have curly hair but I have super long hair that goes down to my behind and this made it so soft and manageable, so ofcourse I wanted to get the full size and I found it here for about $20 cheaper then sephora and Ulta, I don’t know what the deal is I had no issue with sample but this bottle had horrible effects on me, my skin would itch and every time  I used it I would have the most horrible headaches, it took me a little bit of time to figure out that this was causing them, as soon as I stopped using it my headaches went away, I was bummed because it wasn’t cheap and the sample worked so well so I tried it one more time just to be sure and as soon as I did the headache returned!!! Awful
"
"
Oh come on now!!!! My hair is now even drier. I bought this because of a tester pack given to me by Sephora and it was lovely. So what’s the deal? I kept thinking I’ll just try it again, and so I missed my window of opportunity to return it. I’m disappointed and dissatisfied with this product.  Perhaps it’s better to buy this brand elsewhere. —3C hair type

"
This is the best conditioner for curly hair! Be aware if you’re still using silicones in products in your hair, trying to use silicone free products will result in disatisfaction with this product. The silicones prevent the botanical ingredients from penetrating the hair. Silicones create a plastic coating around your hair. It can be extremely difficult to remove. Some long term users of silicone products have to actually grow out the hair that has been treated with silicones. If you follow the curly girl method then you’ll love this product.
"
"
I have very curly, dry, coarse hair that always looked like a pile of straw. I have used DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner for over a year, but my hair was still dry. One day, I discovered this product on Amazon, and decided to give it a try. Even after the first use, my hair was soft and manageable again. I now use Melt Into Moisture at least once a week, and such a difference. I now get many complements on my hair. I love this product!
"
"
The only thing I dislike is the price! But, I do see a significant difference in my low porosity, fine, dry and frizzy hair.  I use it in conjunction with the deep sea repair conditioner once a week for both moisture and strength.
"
"
I use this in conjunction with Deva Curl no poo shampoo/conditioner and styling products, and I love it!Personally, this is one of my favorite smelling products. I breathe deeply every tine I open it!Use: I’ve been doing a once weekly 1 hour deep condition (I just hang out with this in my hair wrapped in do-rag). Once a month I sleep with it in my hair overnight.
"
"
All this talk about Devacurl products, I expected much more in this moisture hair mask.  Didnt see much of a difference after using 2 times per week for 2 weeks.  Even used it under a old-fashioned shower cap the second week - nothing.Favorite Devacurl product (on wavy 2b hair):  Devacurl Light Defining Gel works great and leaves hair soft once air dried and scrunched.
"
"
This conditioner works its magic on my 3a curls. I leave it in overnight and wrap my hair in my Turbie Twist, and shampoo the next morning while it's still in my hair. When I rinse everything out my hair is renewed! I use it once a month, so even though it's pricey this tub will last me about a year I would guess.
"
"
My 9 yr old has combo hair that I have to combat. Lol on wash day it is 4c when shampoo is added. Now I am in love with this conditioner it literally just MELTS INTO THE HAIR SHAFT!!! It makes detangling a little easier for the both of us. SHE doesn't break into tears, my heart doesn't break because I have to detangle her hair 😭and her hair doesnt break. Win, win and the results softer, moisturized hair.
"
"
LOVE this moisturizer! I have shoulder length, regular fullness, color treated hair, loose curls/waves. I tell everyone how awesome this product works. My hair is left soft, not greasy or weighted down and my curls look fabulous.  I use it about 1-2 times a week for 5 min each time. It smells great, too!
"
"
I really wanted to love this as a longtime Deva girl with a pro DevaChan haircut and all. While it does moisturize well, it is no good at facilitating detangljng of my very curly (3b type curls), fine, long hair. In other words, it has poor ‘slip.’ Bummer.
"
"
This is a wonderful deep conditioner. You can go wrong here. Just be mindful of how long you leave it in though, even thought thebinstructions day you can leave it overinight, it might not work out for some types of curls! Love the smell, too!
"
"
Don't use this. I bought it thinking it would work and it has dried my hair and I lost definition to my curls. Checkout the lawsuit if you have experienced these issues!
"
"
I have all the Deva products a curly girl needs, so I thought, until i bought this and B'Leave In.  Sooooo Amazing.  Love them both.  Made a great difference in how my hair is behaving, how it looks and feels.
"
"
literally the best conditioner I have ever used. I use this more then once a week, and leave in my hair a lot. The only problem is now I feel like the regular conditioner isn't working. It is heavy, so if you do not have extremely dry hair I would not leave it in. The smell is amazing, and I highly recommend this conditioner.
"
"
It didn't work for my hair. It makes my hair extremely tangled and dry.
"
"
Dried my hair I used it twice and stopped
"
"
I didn't try it yet but it was leaking and opened
"
"
Been using it once a week for a few months now, and I'm pleased with the results. Keeps my hair soft and full of volume, looks healthier and it's easier to manage.
"
"
my hair is so soft and moisturized! u even use it as a styling creme, has a great hold! (note: when used as a styling creme, it leaves a slight sticky/ tacky residue.)

"
I like this product but all the rave reviews and the steep price tag raised my expectations and I’m sorry to say that it’s not as great as I expected it to be. It’s good but not great in my opinion. I’ve used it twice but I’m still waiting to be blown away.
"
"
Not as easy and convenient as is shown in videos and the result is no where close to what is seen in adds.
"
"
makes my hair, so, so soft, but detangling with it is difficult
"
"
A good hair moisturizer for curly frizzy hair! Makes my hair feel super silky after use.
"
"
I am sooooooooooooo glad I found this product. After every use, my hair just feels ALIVE and so soft and bouncy after. Can not go wrong with this.
"
"
one of my new favorite hair products; fast shipping and awesome packaging; thank you!
"

magic for curls
"

my new favorite deep conditioner its left my hair so soft the price is good for the amount of product you receive  i will be buying again

Best product i've ever used
"
"
One of the best hair masks i have tried
"
"
Life saving conditioner
"
"
Don't buy this if you are expecting miracles. I put this on under a heating cap and my curls completely shrunk up. I had to wash my hair to get them to stretch out again. Perhaps it is made for straighter hair. I have 4C curls. As far as moisture goes, it did look quite moisturized at the beginning of the day. But, at the end of the day my curls were crispy. I ended up getting better results with a regular conditioner and using a mixture of coco, mango and shea butters I warmed up and applied to my hair while they were in liquid form. These usually don't work well, so perhaps the melt into moisture product work as a kind of porosity treatment to allow other products to penetrate. It is impossible to say, however, because I washed my hair twice between these 2 moisture treatments.

AMAZING HAIR MASK. TRANSFORMED MY HAIR!
"
"
Amazing deep conditioner!!!
"
"
Smell is a bit off putting. Works okay.
"
"
Great product
"
"
felt that it dried the hair not moisturid.
"
"
Hair smells lovely and feels lovely after use. Not life changing but a nice conditioner.
"
"
The price right.  I never saw this in pump form.  Nice to find a large quantity.
"
"
Love, love, LOVE!
"
"
Buy far my favorite deep conditioner. The way it leave strands silky and smooth is amazing for an at home treatment. I do not have curly hair, but very dry and damaged ends. This is the best prep for a smooth blow-out! I only wash my hair twice a week, but I use this every time.
"
"
Deep condition for sure - however when I leave it in my hair for extra condition - as I always do - it definitely causes a strange buildup and the coconut/ shea butter/matcha butter smell goes rancid/old after a few days. Like my hair smells bad after a few days. Or the next day. Doesn't happen with the heaven in hair... so I will be using up this pot but not buying more.
"
"
Not only does this product smell AMAZING it also added a ton of moisture to my hair, leaving it soft and touchable. After using it for a month, I've definitely noticed a difference. My hair feels healthier and more hydrated. The one down side is that it seems to be leaving some build up, as my hair isn't curling as tightly as it used to. I'm going to get the Deva Curl Buildup Buster to see if that helps. Of course, this may just be a side effect of having healthier hair.
"
"
I have fine, VERY DRY, curly, delicate, color treated hair and this product made my hair extremely stiff, tangled and matted. I tried twice on clean, wet hair. I think the matcha powder ingredient s to drying for my already dry hair. I like the one decadence conditioner for hydration and everyday styling.
"
"
it works so good!
"
"
This product is for me. All deva curls product works amazing for my hair..
"
"
It leaves my curly hair extra straw feeling.  There is ZERO slip with this conditioning mask.  At no point was I able to comb my hair with a wide tooth comb.  Not while the mask was on or after rinsing.  My hair felt like it hadn't been moisturized in a year.  My regular conditioner provides 100% more slip and a more moisturized feeling.  I tried using this on two separate occasions, one time after using a clarifying rinse and a second after just using a regular shampoo.  My thinking was it just couldn't handle clarified hair by itself.  I was wrong, my hair felt just as dry even without removing everything from my hair prior to its use.
"
"
smells great. works with great slip. left my hair feeling hydrated and happy.
"
"
It leaves my hair feeling dry and brittle. It happens when I leave it in overnight, when I sit under the dryer, or just use it quickly in the shower. Same result. It smells good though.
"
"
Loved it! Finally tamed my frizz😍
"
"
This is a great moisture mask that helps with detangling while it really moisturizes. Heaven in Hair was okay, but this is much better. I have 2b/3c curls with a lot of hair loss from adrogenic allopecia (getting better), so I need detangling, hydration, moisture, and frizz reduction all while not weighing down my hair. This does the trick.
"
"
If I could five this product zero stars, I would. I have been using DC products for one yr and love the products. I have tried melt into moisture, heaven in hair, and the protein mask on soaking wet hair. Fail. In damp hair (low porosity hair tactic). Fail. Sat under a hooded dryer, with a plastic cap, for 30 minutes. Fail. Sooooo, I tried. I really prefer to use the same prpduct line for deep conditioners. But these products made my hair feel dry, brittle, and no slip. I could not detangle my hair at all. I quickly put in Decadence one conditioner. When my hair dried, it was SUPER dry. Felt like it would break off. The next day I immediately clarified my hair using Mielle Organics exfoliating shamppo and then Mielle protein free deep conditioner.  It was excellent! Use on wet hair though, not damp. Since this conditioner ironically stripped my hair of moisture, I will co wash once a week with the decadence one conditioner, wash once a week with decadence no poo, follow up with b'leave in, and then ultra defining gel to elongate my coils (really hydrates my hair). And keep using Mielle Organics protein free deep conditioner.

I've liked other DevaCurl products, but this one wasn't a ""matcha"" for me. See what I did there?I was excited to try it based on past experience and because the terminology ""melt into moisture"" and ""butter"" really spoke to me. I thought it was going to be awesome.It is green with a creamy texture, and I didn't find the scent off-putting or terribly strong. However, I felt I needed a little more of this than I do of other products to get full coverage of my fine, thin, wavy hair.I can usually get a good sense of how a conditioner or mask has performed once I rinse it, and this one didn't rinse out to leave my hair feeling silky. In fact, once I stepped out of the shower to towel-dry it, my hair was actually kind of stiff.I guess my hair looks okay after using this, but I feel like it's anything but moisturized. It honestly feels dry and a little weighed down. I'm going to use what I have and then move on to something else.
"
"
Transformed my hair.  I'm putting a huge strain on my hair currently - trying to get some blonde in it - and it's drying my curls out.  My hair  Loves the Deva products so I looked to see if they had a deep conditioner.  I bought the seaweed mask and melt into moisture.  overnight it transformed my hair back to healthier looking curls.  Thank you.
"
"
I purchased mine from Ulta for 36 dollars.I left it in for 30 min with a plastic cap and over that a micro fiber towel.My hair did look healthier and softer with a shine,curls looked moisturized a bit.. However, it did not do what another mask can not do.I like it but the price is way too expensive.For that price I expected bouncy curls and movement and a lot of shine and much more softness.Hair still frizzed a bit.
"
"
I started off using the Heaven mask from Devacurl and I liked it but this... this is on another level I love this mask!! It is ultra hydrating just like it says my hair hasn’t been this soft in a while and it made detangling easier also it’s nice and thick thicker than the Heaven mask and smells amazing I highly reccomend it!!!
"
"
Definitely 3 out of 5. Left type 4b/c hair type with a stiff feel after use. Left my curls with a medium hydration. Definitely not the go to for my coarse hair, but very reliable as a back up plan.
"
"
This towel is hilarious. Man, I tell ya. Curly hair methods just aren't designed for gals with long hair. This towel is the ""bigger size"" and it looks like the size of a hand towel. My hair is down to my lower back. I have very thick 3B hair. And if I had bangs, maybe those would fit in this towel. But the rest of my hair...Ha! I can hear my follicles mocking me for spending $20 on this oversized wash rag. If your hair is long, ladies...save your Jacksons and go through the thrift store bins and find ya a good oversized t-shirt for $1.25. Works like a dream.
"
"
This is a great towel. I got it and used it the same day. It's great for the plopping method. It did cut the frizz in my hair took about a hour to dry (so if you're looking for a quick dry this isn't it) ONLY issue I had with the towel was the loop it broke and unraveled in a instant leaving me to use the ribbon tied around it in the box as a new loop (cut it doubled it and sewed it on). Overall I think the towel is good just needs a stronger loop.
"
"
I absolutely love this towel. I have curly hair that sops up water. It was taking all day to dry and if I used my aquis towel I could cut it down to 10-12 hours. I tried blow drying and it was laughable. UNTIL this towel. It’s amazing and after using my hair took 2 hours to air dry and when I decided to blow dry instead of air dry it only took 20 minutes! And I finally got a cast from my hair products! Thank you for saving my curly hair.
"
"
My hair is naturally curly long and very thick. Takes forever to dry. This towel definitely cuts drying time but didn't alleviate frizz or define curls. Wish the towel was longer.
"
"
On my curly hair journey I have found that I like flour sack towels cause less frizz than microfiber so I'm a little sorry I bought this.  But It's still a nice large towel to drape on my shoulders and if frizz is not an issue for you it's big enough to plop your hair in which is a plus.
"
"
So much better than the original version. I’ve had the original white one for several years and now keep it in my travel bag so I can use this thicker and larger one at home regularly. This new gray one is large enough to plop or wrap my hair after washing it and really shortens the amount of time I have to expose it to the heat of the diffuser because it pulls so much more water out. Love it.
"
"
I love this towel. I have waist length, wavy hair that frizzes easily. This towel eliminates frizz and helps keep my waves defined. The absorbency of the towel cuts down drying time significantly.
"
"
It’s a great feel and dries the hair. But why can’t it be as long as it is wide? Or vice versa (however you look at it) it’s a weird rectangle, that would make a better square.
"
"
Ive never had a hair towel I liked this much. The size perfectly fits my hair! I have 3A/3B curly hair down to about chest length, and the towel can perfectly wrap around my head. Theres this handy little loop to curl the towel into too, very nice touch. My hair still had some frizz, but nothing is going to be perfect. I am very pleased so far. :)
"
"
Excellent quality,  easy to use with long hair .  ExSorbs excess water quickly  leaving flight moisture and your curls.

"
Totally a life changer for my curly hair! No more frizz, but I also bought some of the other deva curl products too. Using that towel and the products my hair is amazing instead of a frizzy dried mess
"
"
Lives up to its claims and is large enough to wrap my hair. The attached loop is a nice addition for hanging towel to dry.
"
"
Works really well.  Nice size and I like the loop in the back to secure the towel in my head.
"
"
Saw a difference in the amount of frizz in my curls after using this. Amazing product!
"
"
Love this! It look a while for me to figure out how to properly wear it, but it helps absorb water and reduces frizz.
"
"
This is a pretty good towel.  It makes my curls defined without the frizz.  It’s thin enough so I can pack it when traveling.  I have a lot of hair and it covers all of it when I use it as a turban.  It doesn’t get heavy while it’s damp.
"
"
Just started the curly girl method and am really enjoying using this towel.
"
"
helps hair dry without getting frizzy (still need to use product).  this is lightweight and so much better than wrapping a bath towel around head to help dry.  would highly recommend this product and it pulls moisture out of just washed hair without getting it frizzy.
"
"
Works great for curly hair. Great size. Gentle.
"
"
Bought this towel because I am trying to get the curls to come back to my hair. It is a thick microfiber towel. Plenty big enough for a flop or to just scrunch the water out. It leaves my hair slightly damp by wicking the moisture away, but doesn't dry out (damage) the hair. Say goodbye to frizz.
"
"
I needed a bigger microfiber towel since my hair is longer. This towel works great....leaves my hair shiny, Bouncy and still a good amount of product in my hair.
"
"
I love it and use it daily.
"
"
Part of transforming my curl ritual from just ok to amazing curls! must buy!
"
"
Love for my curls
"
"
Works really well for my hair!
"
"
I really like using it! It’s great for my hair.
"
"
Too small. I read the reviews but I had to try for myself I have about neck line hair or shorter also curly hair so I was hoping it would be a good fit I wanted something smaller than a t shirt but this was just to small & too thin upside does it job.
"
"
Never believed the right towelcould bd this great on my curls
"
"
Just got this the other day. Washed and dried it first (cold water) and it came out fine. Used it twice so far and its soft absorbing and I think maybe it tamed a little bit of frizz but not sure. Im glad I purchased it.
"
"
The towel is not cheap feeling and I have curly long hair and whenever I get out of the shower it is so annoying to have wet hair and with this towel just a few pats literally and all the water is gone. GONE! I wish I would have had this starting when I was 10 years old!
"
"
Works great, perfect larger size and plush hand feel. Does a beautiful job giving me no frizz curls.
"
"
Love the towel for my curls!
"
"
The towel itself is nice but the loop you are supposed to tuck it into broke after only 2 uses.  It is difficult to tuck the towel under due to its size.
"
"
Great for scrunch drying my curls in no time!
"
"
This towel works well with the Diva products.
"
"
perfect for curly hair! reduces frizz for sure!
"
"
I love this microfiber towel. It’s thick/plush and does a great job. Makes scrunching my long curly hair easy and reduces frizz.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
This towel is great for my curly hair. I have an American Wave and this helps the curl form whole drying without adding frizz.
"
"
This towel absorbs the excess water in your hair, keeps your curls on lock, and prevents frizz.  My curls never looked better!
"
"
So soft and absorbing. No frizz, just soft waves.
"
"
Love love love!!!! Keeps my curls frizz-free!
"
"
Absorbs the water, less drying time!
"
"
Works fantastic! I have 3C 4A curls and it's a must in my regimen.  It absorbs excess water not needed
"
"
It is great for my hair. Can’t go anywhere without it.
"
"
weight.! Towle is flipping magic. It absorbs water from my hair SO quick I need 20 of them
"
"
Love this product
"
"
It is great! My curly hair sets better with this no frizz towel.
"
"
The best my natural hair loves it.... A must have!!
"
"
Been using and it’s great !It does dry my hair without making it frizzy, I love it .
"
"
Love my Deva Curl microfiber towel!! It’s so soft. And big enough to wrap around and secure on my head
"
"
Amazing product for drying curly hair! Really absorbs water without the frizz :)
"
"
Love this towel! I use it often - at least 2 to 3 times a week along with the devacurl shampoo and conditioner.  It dries my hair quickly and I no longer have frizzy curls...highly recommend for mixed hair types!!
"
"
Towel works great, but the loop broke after two uses and now the stitching on the side is breaking apart
"
"
The fabric and quality of the towel are great, but it is much too small to wrap around your head!...so, what to do with it?
"
"
Too small - couldn't wrap it around my head :(
"
"
The size of a napkin - can't even wrap it around your head - total waste of money
"
"
This “new” towel is no different than the older version. The size is the same, the smell (even after washing and hang drying is the same, and the ribbon hanging loop always breaks off.
"
"
Not quite big enough for my preference, but still a decent product.
"
"
Best towel ever for your hair.
"
"
I received a towel as a gift and I liked it so much I ordered another one! I highly recommend this towel if you have hair that is prone to being frizzy.
"
"
Very soft and perfect size it can fit all of your “thick” hair in it.
"
"
Just an ordinary towel
"
"
Soft
"
"
If you expect to sell this, you can't charge $83. They aren't worth more than $20 and everybody is aware of that.
"
"
I recently embraced the DivaCurl brand. My hair has been getting curlier and curlier for the last decade, and I struggle with keeping the frizz down to a minimum. This towel is large enough to dry my hair by scrunching or by wrapping my wet curls, and does a great job of keeping the frizz down. It's lightweight, so I can wear it while I get ready, and it dries quickly, even in high humidity weather.
"
"
I like this better than the previous Deva towel because it's large enough to wrap around my head. But I'm not a fan of the color grey.  If there were different color options I would give it five stars
"
"
It's small but the perfect size for using on your hair. The only problem is that it makes my hair frizz just as much as using a regular bath towel. I only use it to drape over my shoulders while I'm applying product or letting my hair air dry if I need to protect what I'm wearing.  I would say that scrunching with it a bit does give more definition to my curls, but they frizz so badly afterward that it's not worth it.
"
"
I purchased this for my curly girl method of absorbing water from my hair without creating frizz.  The towel is a great size and very absorbent.  I scrunched out the water and hung it to dry by the convenient attached loop.  I also used it to wrap around my plastic hair cap when I deep conditioned my hair to help create heat.
"
"
The microfiber towel is large enough to do the job of scrunching the water out of my curls. It is larger than the original DC towel, but if it were just 3 -4 inches longer, I could wrap it around my head and let it stay there. I have shoulder length hair that is very thick.  I may just sew on a few inches of regular fabric to the 2 short ends to  help me wrap the towel.
"
"
This towel is great for my wavy hair.  It dries fast, and I'm able to launder it with the other towels.  It is SUPER soft, and seems to have helped calm down the frizz.  Also, it's super compact, so easy to take when traveling.
"
"
My curly hair is in heaven with this towel. It’s a great size and amazing at drying my hair n not making it frizzy an no damage either. Love it! And totally recommend it, not just for curly girls but everyone.
"
"
I've used this every day for 2 months and just love it. It works exactly as it should. Absorbent, easy to hang, eliminates frizz. All good.
"
"
I wish it was a tad longer, even an inch or two with a good way to attach or close it so that it would stay wrapped on my head even just long enough to get my makeup on. I still use it, but it is not convenient and just falls off. I actually just prefer a regular towel.
"
"
I bought this for my daughter’s hair holds water and is so hard to dry. It was amazing how much water it took out of her hair and saved on drying time!
"
"
Just the right size. Really helps my curls stay separated. Put those oversized cotton Ts away. I highly recommend!
"
"
Too small maybe if your bald it’ll work but I got thick long curly hair so this is basically a napkin
"
"
Awesome buy. Definitely a must have.
"
"
The towel works great but I have long hair and this towel is small and won’t cover my whole hair
"
"
This towel has worked so well to dry my curly hair. My hair has had less frizz than when I used to use a regular towel.
"
"
To expensive, could have used a lot less expensive and had the same results
"
"
Really helps my curly hair dry and not become frizzy.  A little expensive but worth the price I think.
"
"
Wonderful towel to control friz. Try it. You will be pleased. Fast delivery!
"
"
Bought as a gift for a friend, but she had been eyeing this up for awhile.
"
"
I love my Devatowel so much I bought another one.
"
"
Very good to decrease the frizz! I am surprised
"
"
Too small. Didn't do what was promised. Disappointed.
"
"
Not big enough to even cover my head.
"
"
To small.This looks more like a dish towel.
"
"
I love this towel!
"
"
I love this towel and it has cut my drying time quite a bit.
"
"
Im sorrynthat i have to report extreme itching from this product. The end result curl was Ok but the itch was so intense i had to get up and take a shower to wash my hair
"
"
DevaCurl is the best product I have ever used on my curl hair.  Nothing has made my curl last so long without frizz.  I am constantly getting compliments on my “beautiful curls.”  These are the perfect travel size too!!
"
"
Just bought this for my niece who has extremely thick, curly hair, and it works great to define the curls and keep them shiny!
"
"
I have super curly hair and this product enhances my curls and control frizz.
"
"
Works great! Hair feels wonderful and soft and curls are defined and no frizz. Only complaint is that I bought this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas and the packaging came covered in stickers. Bar codes etc.
"
"
Best product I have ever used. Gave my curls a new life. So much easier to wear my hair natural.

Original product and packaging.  Great full sizes for shampoo and conditioner. The others I would say are travel size or testers but still nice to have for the price. I've used the product twice and my hair feels good after but for me I still need more product in my hair to get my desired look.  For the price it's worth a shot, better deal than I have found in any store.
"
"
A lot of slippage, very hydrating. well defined shiny curls popped with first use on low porosity 3a-3b hair.
"
"
It’s so hard to get the stuff out of the bottles. The written instructions require a magnifying glass to read.
"
"
So far I am very happy with the hair product! It's a bit pricey but it's cheaper on Amazon then any big box stores I've checked !My daughters hair is moderately curly but it knots up often causing a lot of issues when brushing. So far after fallowing all the steps on the box , I haven't hardly has to brush it at all! I can run my fingers through it no issue!
"
"
I love these products!! I have always had natural curly hair that was almost impossible to manage but little did I know I was taking care of it all wrong!! I’ve had so many people ask me what I did to my hair to make it look so healthy and my curls so bouncy! I’ve even managed to get my mother, mother-in-law and my grandmother to buy it and love!
"
"
Love the Devacurl Decadence No-poo. It thoroughly cleanses without stripping. The No-poo and One Condition are both great for detangling my 4A hair. I prefer the One Condition as a Leave-in over Devacurl's official leave-in that comes in this kit. I haven't tried the Wash Day Wonder as I have shorter, high porosity hair which detangles well with a coconut oil pre-poo.
"
"
Very happy with the products. This was my first time using devacurl and can definitely see the difference since I started using them. Not a big fan of the conditioner, i wasn’t able to de tangle my hair with it at all so I’m not using it at all, but love all of the other products in the box.
"
"
I’ve used devacurl before and I can say this is 100% authentic product, same smell same result. Leaves my curls so defined, soft and smells amazing. I’ve recommended this kit to everyone!
"
"
Bang for your buck. 2 full size products and trial size styling products.
"
"
It unfortunately did not define my curls at all.

Very happy with the products. This was my first time using devacurl and can definitely see the difference since I started using them. Not a big fan of the conditioner, i wasn’t able to de tangle my hair with it at all so I’m not using it at all, but love all of the other products in the box.
"
"
I’ve used devacurl before and I can say this is 100% authentic product, same smell same result. Leaves my curls so defined, soft and smells amazing. I’ve recommended this kit to everyone!
"
"
Bang for your buck. 2 full size products and trial size styling products.
"
"
It unfortunately did not define my curls at all.
"
"
My curls are in love!
"
"
We love their products
"
"
I thought it was going to be bigger but it wasn’t they are great products but not exactly for my hair and the shampoo cleaner was a little bit open so some of it spilled out
"
"
Deranged my child’s hair great! I don’t feel it gives enough moisture, with the leave in conditioner and styler.
"
"
Deva curl is under investigation for causing hair loss and dry scalp
"
"
This purchase exceeded my expectations. The price, products, and the packaging was worth every penny!
"
"
Wil definitely buy again
"
"
It’s amazing!!!!

Loved it

Another awful scent failure by Deva.  If you like the smell of stale baby bottom products this will be great for you.  If you would like to avoid headaches from smelling nasty baby changing products all day long this is probably not for you.  Not to mention how creepy people look at you when they smell this nasty stuff on you.  It is like you bathed in diaper changing lotions, just vile.

I'm always worried when I buy discounted high end products from Amazon. There's the stories that the product is half gone or not as described in the a knock off. This was the real thing, not used, in original packaging, and just like you would buy at a local store.
"
"
I got this my coworker for her birthday who's said she's always had unmanageable curls that just frizz without much of a form to them. After using the trial pack for about a week or so, she said it's the first time in 30 years she feels confident enough to wear her hair down. Her frizz has massively subsided, ringlets are forming and the products aren't heavy and don't leave a greasy or oily residue. I've attached a before and after picture to show the difference!

This set introduced me to products that my hair loved so much that I’ll now make part of my routine.  The standouts are the coconut supecream (smells great and creates lovely, shiny spiral curls) and the washday wonder (use pre no-poo to loosen those tangles).  This set has made wash day fun again.
"
"
Good product and great value set. Having issue with getting product out of bottle for conditioner. But beside that works as advertised.
"
"
It made my hair so greasy. I went down to using nothing but the shampoo. Didn’t matter. I don’t think it’s good for white person wavy hair.
"
"
It really is light weight and curls my hair nicely.
"

If you have very long, lightened, curly hair I would say this product line isn’t for you. Over a period of 2 months I have lost around 8”-10” of length of my lightened hair. I sheet you not. Please don’t use this unless your hair is super strong and healthy. Not good for bleached hair that was FINE & growing normally before using this. I used the entire line for 10 weeks and got massive breakage.Buildup buster, pre-poo, low poo, 3 of the conditioners, the detangle spray, all 3 gels, mousse, you name it, I am back to my old stuff trying to deal with the massive loss of hair.I’ll say that if you have strong, non porous hair this would be great but not good on white girl lightened curly hair!

My hair is wavy/curly, thin, dry, frizzy. I used Pantene shampoo and conditioner until I stumbled upon a “miracle” DevaCurl no poo cleanser and One conditioner. I was hoping to get rid of frizz and make my hair healthier. I’ve been using DevaCurl no poo and their one conditioner for about 3 weeks now, twice a week. My hair seems to be even drier and frizzier then ever before. I also noticed it gets tangled very easily and is very coarse to touch.  It is a mess, I am going back to regular shampoo and conditioner.

I learned of this product by going to a Devacurl hair specialist. The specialist taught me what products to use and how to use them properly on my hair. I have to say it is a process but well worth it. Since I've used this product, my hair has come back to life. I always get compliments for my hair and that it smells so good! Love it! You need to know what your curl type is whether you have wavy, curly or super curly hair. This product runs by three different types of curls which are, wavy (light green bottle lid), curly (green bottle lid) and super curly (teal bottle lid). My curl type is curly so I purchased the (Green bottle lid).Process: While in the shower I used my No-Poo(Green bottle lid) and massaged my scalp and crunched it at the same time. When rinsing my hair I allow the No-Poo run down to the tip of my hair until you rinse completely. I then use the Devacurl Conditioner (which I was delivered the wrong bottle, Teal bottle lid for super curly but I didn't bother to return it because I really needed a conditioner for my hair) and massaged the scalp. As I began to rinse my hair I allowed the conditioner run down to the tip of my hair and began to run my fingers through my hair for any tangles. (You can use a wide-tooth brush for the stubborn tangles but only while you are in the shower with conditioner on your hair!) You can leave some conditioner on your hair when your rinsing. When done with rinsing, lean your hair over, begin to use the Devacurl gel and begin to crunch your hair. Then get a microfiber towel and continue to crunch the hair. (I recommended you to NOT wrap the towel on your hair to dry!!) It's best to crunch as it stops dripping wet.  As you use the towel your hair begins to dry. Please use a MICROFIBER TOWEL!! It helps with frizz control. I purchased one on amazon and it's amazing! I then used curl clips (Bought from Amazon) while my hair air dries and get myself  ready to allow some volume when I get ready to defuse my hair. When I'm ready to defuse my hair I first remove the hair clips and use the Devacurl defuser which I love!. Totally recommend and begin to defuse your hair. After getting used to the process it will get easier for you.  I still want to try more products from Devacurl and when I do I will let you know my results.
"

Maybe it works well, but I find the smell to be so awful that I can't bring myself to use it very often. As som have pointed out it does smell like roses, but like cheap, fake roses ... it's an overwhelming smell.  I am somewhat sensitive to scent, so it could just be me, but I won't be purchasing this again.
"
"
I used this once.  My hair is thicker and looks great.The problem is, my scalp is burning all day the next day.  I can hardly wait to wash this off my head.Also, ""No Poo"" usually means no chemicals or soaps...just, for example, baking soda.  I don't know what it means here.  The ingredients aren't listed, and it is clearly a chemical fest.
"
"
I was pleasantly surprised at how soft my hair was after using it and it seems to have more body, but I am noticing a slight residue on my scalp. Not enough to bother me, but I didn't have it with the no-poo I usually use. Decided to try something different than my old stand-by bc my hair was beginning to lose body. Will probably start alternating it with my usual.
"
"
I’ve been using No Poo for about 6 years now and it is still the best stuff for curly hair. I’ve tried sooo many things for my super curly, color-treated hair, but No Poo still is THE best. If I use regular shampoo, my hair feels as is someone poured glue onto it; it gets all stuck together and hard/dry feeling in the shower. Yuck!!No Poo is life changing!! I comb my hair with a wide tooth comb while i leave conditioner on it, then rinse as I comb. NO MORE combing after that or you will disturb  the curl pattern and have stringy lifeless curls!PS - unless you have a Cosmo discount, buy off of amazon!
"
"
Being sulfate-free, this product produces zero lather, which feels really strange at first.  However, this is BY FAR the BEST line of hair products I have ever purchased in my adult life.  I've been through Redken, Mixed Chicks, Miss Jessie's, BioSilk, MoroccanOil, Pantene and who knows what else, but I honestly don't think I've ever been happier.Even after the first wash, my curls have more structure, bounce and vitality, and the ends are no longer brittle and dry.  I have less frizz and my head no longer smells like a salon, but like floral/mint/tea tree extract.I used this shampoo in combination with the One Condition Cream conditioner and the Heaven in Hair Moisture Treatment for my current results.
"
"
This DevaCurl No-Poo is great for my wavy ""locks.""  It also smells so divine -a clean fresh smell.  I've been using this product for around 9 months and combined with other DevaCurl products.  There is a conditioner and a cream for styling in the curl that are all great together.  I also use a micro-fiber towel to place over my hair and scrunch my curls.  This has been so beneficial to me and my ""Curly Girl' curls!
"
"
I have mixed feelings about this shampoo. On the one hand, it's more economical than some other nonlathering shampoos, so you won't go broke trying it. However, the smell is just too much. I believe it's mint and rose -- an odd combination. It's the mint I object to. Virtually EVERY nonlathering shampoo is ""minty"". Why? I think it's an attempt to ""compensate"" the user somehow for the lack of lather. Like if you don't have lather you might not think your hair is clean, so let's dump in some mint to mimic the ""clean"" feeling of toothpaste. The bottom line is that if you use this shampoo you will smell *strongly* like a cough drop. The other issue I have with this stuff is that it actually doesn't make my hair curl at all. I have wavy hair and this shampoo actually made it look straight, frizzy, and dry.  I have used Suave Shea Butter Conditioner (less than $2 at Safeway) as a ""nonlathering hair cleanser"" and my hair is shiny, wavy, and smells really good. I think this nonlathering shampoo craze is just the latest marketing ploy by manufacturers who think women are stupid.
"
"
If anyone I knew had dry hair, I'd definitely recommend this. But I went from one extreme to the other, which is why I think this didn't work. I used to shampoo once daily (sometimes more) with a daily clarifying shampoo. I wanted my hair to be thicker and healthier, and for it to stop getting greasy mid-afternoon. So I gave DevaCurl a try and started shampooing every other day. It's been about 2.5 months now, and my hair is greasy even immediately after I shower. If you're using harsh shampoos on your hair right now, maybe go to a sulfate-free shampoo every other day before diving into this. Otherwise, you'll be like me and spend months with greasy hair wondering when it'll go away. I'll certainly hold on to the bottle to use every now and then, but I'll be purchasing a sulfate-free shampoo, as DevaCurl just didn't work for me.

I have curly hair and I used Bumble and Bumble products for a long time. I started to get dandruff from dry scalp so I tried this product as a way to get the oils moving. I wash my hair every other day, and I wash my hair using Devacul no-poo shampoo for two or three times in a row, then use a shampoo with detergent. My scalp feels refreshed and my hair is really soft, and my dandruff problem is almost gone after using this shampoo for a month! My scalp does get a little too oily after 2-3x of washing with this shampoo so using another product is important for me. I hear from friends who went no-poo that once your head gets used to it, you can keep using no-poo for a long time. Maybe I'll get there too. But even if I don't, this product is a winner!
"
"
I use this in-between shampoos. I typically wash my hair every 3-4 days but work out daily and use this to feel clean after a workout when I don't want to wash my hair again. It definitely makes my hair feel clean and is very moisturizing, sometimes to the point of being greasy. Still, I prefer this to killing my hair by drying it out with over shampooing. As far as the curling aspect, I have wavy hair and I haven't found that this affects my hair texture at all.
"
"
Smells fantastic, and cleans my hair without stripping it of moisture. It’s can be a bit pricy, but a little goes a long way and I only have to use it 1-2 times per week (type 3B curls)
"
"
Creamy, gentle, moisturizing cleanser, perfect if you follow the curly girl method.  No silicones, sulfates, parabens, etc.  Great for when you need to refresh your hair but not intended to remove product buildup or very dirty hair.
"
"
If your hair is curly or wavy, as mine is, this is a great product. It just takes some time to get used to the no suds feel, and I mean it's absolutely no suds. It's like you're washing your hair with conditioner, but it does leave your hair clean. The trick is to really use your fingers and massage the scalp as you wash. Also, make sure you really rinse well. This  will leave your hair with nice curl and no frizz. It's very conditioning which is what curls need. I definitely recommend this product. Use it with the One Condition for best results.
"
"
I usually wash my hair in conditioner, and use this No-Poo once a week to get it cleaner. It's a bit drying, but not as drying as shampoo.I have medium-length highlighted fine blonde hair and have to wash chlorine out every day.Smells kind of minty, which I like.
"
"
I can’t get enough of this shampoo when I’m cleansing my hair. From the smell to the minty feeling on your scalp when you wash - I just love it! I definitely recommend this shampoo.
"
"
Using this product now for several hears.  It is a non-lathering, sulfate free shampoo that assists in retaining my highlighted color and helps with the natural curls.  I shampoo only twice a week and air dry after applying a curl lotion to help the very damp curls.  I recommend first shampooing in the shower and leaving it on for few minutes before rinsing.  I don't use conditioner as my hair is very fine and makes it limp. The shampoo lasts a long time.
"
"
I've read a lot of good reviews of Deva No Poo. Wish more of them had mentioned the scent.  It smells (to me) like I'm washing my hair with cold cream. Ick.Of course, scent is a very subjective experience, and your mileage may vary.  But I personally can't take the stuff.  I'm going back to using Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Creme, which smells FABULOUS (to me), but admittedly isn't available on Amazon Prime.As for how this worked, it cleaned well without stripping.  My hair dried all FRIZZY, but I can't very well blame that on the No Poo after just one use (frizz happens).
"
"
I love this conditioning.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I used to struggle straighten my hair; it would turn frizzy wiping an hour with the high humidity level that we experience in South Florida.  With this conditioner, my hair stays straight and non frizzy.
"
"
It's amazing in that your curls really do react differently with this shampoo.  I have not had great success styling my hair with these products but am not ready to give up yet.  I think it will just take more time to figure out what works best.  I have not had success using the additional conditioner and gel to style my hair.  Overall I do like the shampoo and if you have curly hair you really should try it.  The formulation really is quite amazing that a shampoo can cause your curls to 'behave' differently!
"
"
For the first couple of weeks of use, this product seemed like a miracle worker on my extremely dry, chemically damaged hair because it is intensely moisturizing and gentle. The scent is fantastic and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and looking great. However, this product doesn't clean my scalp properly, causing a buildup that leads to irritating bumps, mild dandruff, and annoying itchiness. I normally don't experience any scalp issues, so I would really caution against using this if you already have problems with your scalp. As a no-pooer, I cringe at having to strip my hair with sulfates found in ordinary shampoos, but this sulfate-free product just does not clean your hair whatsoever. It really does feel like you're just putting more conditioner on your hair every time you wash (It's kind of like if you were to apply moisturizer on your face for days without washing it.. yuck!). But all of the conditioning sans stripping probably explains why it makes your hair look great. I really wanted to love this product because of the all natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals but I'm forced to use a more clarifying shampoo soon after using this to avoid furiously scratching at my head all day. Also, although I only apply this to my scalp, I found myself having to use loads of this product on my medium thickness hair which makes this a bit pricey even for the great deal you get on Amazon. Will not be purchasing again.
"
"
I've been using Deva Curl products for a year now & it is the first line of products that work & still continue to work.  I've used so many products, i'm sure like a lot of us curly haired ladies have. I had my collection of products under the sink that worked for a time & then just didn't.  But I'm really impressed and although they are a bit pricey I will by them at different times & when I see good deals & just stock up, but the this shampoo is really great. I've using some ""non sulfate"" shampoos and either they stink or they make your hair feel weird, or they actually do suds up. This one smells great & I never have any product build up, it really cleans your hair and you don't have to use a lot of it.  It's a great product
"
"
I started using this about 5 months ago and my frizzy, unruly curls have had a new chance at life :) Smells great and does exactly what it advertises! I even went to a new salon last month, recognized the scent, and they use this shampoo/No Poo as well.
"
"
Love these products. Can't buy them where I live so I stopped using them and tried other stuff, not a good thing!  My color is Demi and Red and this product does not fade it out, it also keeps my hair cleaner longer because I need less products. You need to get used to no suds when you first use it, but the feel of your hair will keep you using it!
"
"
I have wavey hair, it's always frizzy after I wash it, but looks good the next day. After the no poo it's far less frizzy, but pretty flat and easy to control. The only thing that really bothers me is the smell, it smells like the cheap soap that's in some rest stop bathrooms. They try to mask it with a floral smell, but the one that lingers is the cheap soap smell. It's a trade off.
"
"
Hair smells bad within a day when I normally wash my hair once a week.
"
"
Works great!! Love it on my daughters hair.
"
"
I didn't know until recently that this was the culprit but it is. I'm glad I was finally able to pinpoint the issue but I wish I had figured it out sooner, I've lost so much hair.
"
"
I swear by this stuff. Great for naturally curly hair like mine.
"
"
I was very excited to finally try this product after reading so many great things about it, however, I found this product to leave my hair feeling unwashed and greasy. The only redeeming thing about it is its great smell.
"
"
I'm still getting used to shampooing with no suds.... I was doing the no-poo challenge but was having difficulty with my hair being incredibly greasy after just a few hours. This really seems to do the trick! Just be thorough rinsing it out from you hair, since without suds it's difficult to tell when it's fully rinsed out. A friend of mine with curly hair also uses it and we've both noticed less frizz.
"
"
Great co wash it you want to stop using detergents in your hair which is what most shampoos on the market are currently made from.
"
"
I really love this product! I had only just heard about it and never tried it before until i purchased it on Amazon. it has exceeding my expectations! my hair looks and feels more purely healthy than i ever thought it could! I had to buy the conditioner too! I would not recommend using one or the other. use them together and your hair results will be better than you can even imagine! shipping was prompt and without incident.
"
"
I love deva curl.
"
"
Awesome No Poo Shampoo! I have been using this for over 18 months, and I will never go back to a shampoo/conditioner! I use this a couple of times a week, and have never used a conditioner, One bottle lasts me about a year, so it is good on the pocketbook! I have had friends try it, and they also will not go back to their pricey shampoos.
"
"
shampoo without the lather takes some getting used too. But I love the scent of this shampoo and the squeaky clean feeling of my hair after a good shampoo!  Makes my hair more receptive to conditioning product as well.
"
"
Okay, I have never tried a no lather shampoo and to be honest, I was pretty skeptical. I didn't think it would be possible for a shampoo that doesn't lather to properly clean your hair. Well, this has proven me wrong! It cleans you hair perfectly. You just have to make sure that once every 2 weeks you use a lathering shampoo to avoid any build up. This product has really helped get a lot of shine and health back to my hair. Great product.
"
"
I love this stuff. When I was a little girl I had beautiful curly hair. When I was in my 20's I couldn't keep my hair long because of the frizz, so I would perm it. When I got married I stopped using perms because I could see more damage from the perms chemicals.I was sad because I wanted the curly hair I had when I was a little girl. I thought I would never have it again because of the damage and the frizz. What I didn't know was the shampoo I was using had detergent in it that damaged my hair too. When I let my hair grow shoulder length I would wet my hair and use stiff paste to keep it from frizzing. Then my hairdresser introduced me to DevaCurl. No more hard, crunchy, dry, frizzy hair. I was so happy. I use all the DevaCurl products. My hair is so soft and shiny and healthy. The curl is beautiful. Just like when I was a little girl. Thank you DevaCurl.
"
"
This stuff and their normal no-poo cleanser is the best stuff for curly hair!!! If your hair is really fine, though, you might want wash with their low-poo sometimes so there is no buildup. I never have a bad hair day since I switched to their cleansers.
"
"
best conditioner I've ever used!
"
"
Love this product and buy it all the time.
"
"
Nice shampoo for curly hair. Keeps the junk down in your hair
"
"
It stinks so bad and makes my eyes burn!!!  I have used Deva products for years.  This is not normal!
"
"
love
"
"
This is the best smelling shampoo ever. Definitely kinda smells like a grandma’s perfume, but I LOVE IT.
"
"
Love the smell and the way it makes the hair feel.

I'm giving this product two stars because it appears to be a genuine DevaCurl brand product, it works, and I'm not so dissatisfied that I'm returning it... Returning is just too much of a hassle sometimes!However, the product described and pictured is not the product I received. DevaCurl has a number of specific lines within their brand (DevaCurl, DevaCare, Deva Curl Decadence, etc.) I specifically ordered the DevaCurl original, the one in the green bottle that is pictured in the image for this product.I received the DevaCare No-Poo. Yes, it is made by DevaCurl, but it is in a different colored bottle (white with green writing instead of the other way around) and it is a different product entirely because it is from a different line. The fragrance, formula, and intended user is different than the original DevaCurl No-Poo. This DevaCare product is formulated for individuals with chemically processed hair. I have been informed by stylists that it can be drying to the hair overtime because of the added Vitamin C that is used in DevaCare (not used in the DevaCurl line.)So, yes, it's a bit confusing... DevaCurl by DevaCurl versus DevaCare by DevaCurl, but the picture and description made it clear that the product was not DevaCare, and yet that is what I received. Nonetheless, it is working okay and I will finish up this bottle, but I don't think I would trust this particular seller in the future.

I've used this shampoo for years. I love the way it smells and it leaves my hair feeling clean without a lather.
"
"
Product was recommended by my stylist, love it!  The whole line is a process and when used the result are awesome!!
"
"
Thanks

I have curly hair and live in South Florida (humid!!!!). Deva Curl products live my hair frizz less, defined and soft...I have so many complements on my hair. Tip: Read the Deva Curl book to learn the right technique base on your curl type.
"
"
As a curly-haired woman who's tried pretty much every product on the market (well, not quite) I can say this & DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel are my favorites.  I get lots of compliments on my hair, mainly from other curly-haired women.
"
"
I have thick wavy hair that has a lot of curl in the back and I've never been able to control the frizz until I discovered DevaCurl No-Poo and the Conditioner. I only wash my hair twice a week and I get tons of compliments! If you can get over using shampoo that is creamy and has no suds, you'll end up loving this product. I hair no longer feels dry. Go DevaCurl!!!
"
"
The shampoo works perfect with the conditioner. My hair was really clean and moisture.
"
"
I have been using the DevaCurl products for a while now.  I use the No-Poo followed by the One Condition.  After washing my hair, I use the leave-in conditioner and then the light gel.  I do think my curly hair is better managed with these products but I don't think I have the technique down perfect yet.  I did try the Lo-Poo and didn't like that at all.  For my hair, the No-Poo works much better.  I think everyone's hair is different and the trick is finding what works best for you!
"
"
I love this product and have been using it for almost 10 years
"
"
good
"
"
Does not smell or work like the real product. I am left with tacky, frizzy, not curly hair. Does not even smell like the original.
"
"
This is by far my favorite 'shampoo' to use on my hair. I'm a curly girl 2C.
"
"
It was too heavy for my hair and i couldn't stand the smell.  I do still use the conditioner on occasion, but using both in one wash left my curly hair looking very greasy.
"
"
Love this shampoo, it makes my hair soft and not stripped ,i can shampoo my hair 3 times before it started feeling stripped .It lasts me about 6 months !
"
"
Nothing like it for curly hair
"
"
I got hooked on the DevaCurl line after my stylist recommended and used them on me.  I have fine, very curly hair that hates me and the rest of the world.  This is the only stuff that makes me look like a normal person.  The No-Poo was a little strange the first couple of times since it doesn't produce suds, but I adjusted quickly, and my hair is definitely not dirty.  The lavender smell is divine.  The price I got on Amazon beats anything local (I can't afford shopping local principles right now) and even in Alaska I received it pretty quickly.
"
"
This is the only shampoo I use for the best outcome for my curls
"
"
I've been using it for years and will never go back to shampoo. Even co-washes aren't as good. No lather, just creamy cleansing that doesn't dry out your curls.Leaves your hair clean and soft.
"
"
Nice product. Specially with the diffuser. But the packaging for the bottle was unsuccessful. Big part of the shampoo had spilled. The cap was loose and no seal underneath. Too bad for the wasted part. Please please make better packaging
"
"
I ordered a NO POO and I received a conditioner?!
"
"
The cap on the bottle was broken when I opened the package and a good amount of the product had spilled out. I'm pretty disappointed.
"
"
If you have curly hair you can't go wrong with DevaCurl.  I only use DevaCurl No-Poo on my hair, maybe twice a week, and it keeps my scalp clean, my curls bouncy, and helps prevent frizz.  I have been using No-Poo for over 10 years now, and I'll never go back!
"
"
I ordered this product and was very disappointed with it.  It did not work well at all with my hair texture.  I would tell others about this product but warn them to test it on a small section of hair first.
"
"
I only recieved one, though I paid for a 2 pack. 😡 I do love this product, but expect to get what I pay for.
"
"
I don't mind the smell at all. Some other reviewers said it smelled bad but I don't see why. It doesn't lather but it's still a great way to wash your hair and my hair was super clean afterwards.
"
"
I wasn't sure that this would actually work to get my hair clean and must admit that sometimes I still feel like I need a real shampoo. But on the whole this has been great for my curly, thin, and dyed hair.  Very gentle
"
"
I'm not a fan of the smell, but this shampoo does seem to clean my scalp without drying out my hair.  Doesn't seem particularly moisturizing, but it is definitely non-stripping.
"
"
I had the rong product delivered and I didn't like it.
"
"
Great product came in box only issued the cream spells a little.Delivered on time.
"
"
Love the product. Don’t love that the bottle was not closed and it was all over inside the bag it was delivered in.
"
"
This is the best shampoo, I wish that it didn't smell like roses and chamomile but that is not enough to deter me from using it. It's by far the best product I've ever put on my hair, way better than Wen!
"
"
To keep my hair from frizzing, I leave conditioner in. This I can't leave in, so I sent it back. I prefer the separate shampoo and conditioner.
"
"
I have curly hair and find that this cleans it and keeps it in it's natural state.
"
"
I don't care for the rose smell, but that is only because I prefer spice smell over flower smells.
"
"
I have really curly hair & have always struggled to find good products that don't dry out my hair.  I have been using this for about two months now & I don't know how I ever survived without it.  I plan on buying this in bulk to stock up on in case of a catastrophic event this will be the first thing I pack in my survival kit!!!
"
"
love this
"
"
Works just as described. Arrived quickly. Love!
"
"
For the last 3 months I've used NoPoo, Deva Curl One Condition and Frizz free Volumizing mousse because they perform so well. But throughout that time I developed a low-grade cough/chest congestion that the doc said was an allergy and have been sensing the smell of dried smoke or firewood that seems to be around my hair (scent and smoke-free home). I recently skipped the Deva regimen for a couple of days (those were bad hair days!) and the problem cleared up. Hard to say definitely that it's the products in this hot, humid summer when our HVAC and swimming pool and indoor allergens could be causing it. I hope it's not an allergy to Deva - I love these products. I'll repeat the test a few times.
"
"
This product is good to have, but it's not really worth the money.  You could use a conditioner from the drugstore that is silicone free that would be just as good for the purpose of cleansing.
"
"
I have a natural wave to my hair and I love this product.  My sister gave me a bottle of DevaCurl No-Poo last year for Christmas and I simply love it.  It cleans my hair well, is good for the environment, has no sulfites, and I don't have to use a conditioner.  What a product!
"
"
My favorite thing about this product is that I can detangle my hair while washing it. It's like magic.
"
"
sadly it has wheat amino acids and I have celiac....more than allergic.  Love this product but can't use it sadly.
"
"
this is a must have along with the one condition product. it smells wonderful and you don't need very much to get the job done.
"
"
It softens and moisturizes and helps to enhance curl pattern while refreshing the senses with a surprisingly clean smell with the odd rose peppermint fragrance.
"
"
Unfortunately this product didn't work for my hair type..
"
"
Cleans without drying.
"
"
My hairdresser recommended this no sulfate shampoo for my curly hair and I use it daily.  Buying it online saves me money from the salon price.
"
"
Doesn't dry your hair out and pretty much the only conditioner that doesn't give myself dandruff. Would buy again (Think I'm on bottle number 3).
"
"
I absolutely love this shampoo, my hair does not get weighed down, and boy does it curl!great if you have a perm and want curls not frizz
"
"
Great product
"
"
Great for curls. I have a perm and it is great, especially when the perm is new.
"
"
Nice product. Doesn't lather much though.
"
"
Loved it
"
"
Great softening, cleaning, conditioning, and manages to keep my hair in great condition.  Glad I found it in time to help.
"
"
I can use this everyday and it doesn't strip my hair. My fine hair comes out with added body and no frizz.  Love this shampoo! It only takes a small amount, so it lasts a long time.
"
"
Not great, I have thin blond curly/wavy hair. I used as directed and my hair was weighed down and too oily to skip a shampoo for a day. I have been using Alterna for a year and wanted to try a more affordable product. This product might appear cheaper by the ounce but the amount you have to use is almost three times as much product. It takes forever to rinse out, and I lost clumps of hair every wash. I switched back to Alterna and after a few days I'm back to beautiful shiny hair, that doesn't break every time I wash it.
"
"
I was recommended this product from a friend to control my frizz. I use it to co wash my hair every 2-3 days and Ouidad shampoo once a week which using Too Shea conditioner in between. It does a great job of getting build up gunk from my hair making it light again while not activating my frizz issue. It also has a nice minty smell to it. Once my regimen in the shower is complete, I rinse my hair out, leaving it nice and soft again. Must better than any of my old products. Give it a try if you have curls or bad frizz =]
"
"
use second day after low poo and it works well
"
"
This tames my nappy curls-its the only thing that works for me.
"
"
Muy bueno
"
"
expensive but it does work
"
"
I was very surprised how quickly the product came, but was disappointed to see the top broken in off of the Deva Curl No Poo...I'm sure the vendor didn't send it off like that and it became broken in the process of delivery.  Overall, I would say the product is good so far.  I need another month or so to truly evaluate the results of this product.
"
"
I love the smell of this product.  Gentle on my hair.  Follow with Conditioner from Deva Curl. No more frizzies.
"
"
I'm a guy, and avoided growing out my wavy hair because I didn't know how to go care of it.  This stuff convinced me to like my longer hair :)
"
"
Love this stuff.
"
"
I wasn't crazy about the smell but I have to admit that I love this stuff. I have wavy, corse frizzy hair and this makes it very soft especially the second day. The smell dissipates after a while. Now to find it in a bigger bottle since my hair is so thick I use quite a bit.
"
"
This no-poo cleanser makes my curls so soft. It smells really good, and my hair actually feels clean/refreshed after I use it. I tried the baking soda method, but I gave up on it because my hair always felt weird and never clean. With this cleanser, my hair feels clean again and super moisturized.
"
"
It was okay. I bought this because it was recommended by Curly Nikki but I wasn't right for my hair.
"
"
Best non-stripping shampoo I've tried.  Wish it was a little cheaper but I guess you get what you pay for
"
"
I love this product! I mainly use it, but once a week I use the Low Poo. They're a great combination
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and wanted to try this shampoo because I thought it would help hold my curls and keep them looking better throughout the day. After using this shampoo for about a month I have found my hair always feels like there is a film on it. This shampoo doesn't seem to get my hair really clean. The other thing is that the shampoo smells horrible. Some people might like the smell, but not me!
"
"
Works and smells amazing
"
"
first time my daughter's hair had shine
"
"
Great product. I’ve been using it for years.
"
"
So far - so goo!
"
"
I had worn my hair curly until my forties, now at 53, I have been trying to straighten my thinning hair and the result was a lot a frizz and a lot of work. A coworker recommended DevaCurl and I am hooked. I have gained back about 30 minutes of my day and I am told my curly style makes me look younger!
"
"
Very odd that it doesn't lather, but still cleaned my hair fantastically - and smells great!  I wanted it to be the last product that touched my hair because of it's smell, but was happy that the other DevaCurl products smell equally as great - thank you DevaCurl!
"
"
As advertised
"
"
Worked great on conditioning his hair!
"
"
I was very satisfied with my results. Will buy again. It didn't make my hair feel dry. It was very soft.
"
"
The product is great but the smell is awful . I stopped using it after only one use
"
"
Leaves my hair clean and healthy!  Don't worry if doesn't lather; it is working.  It gives my hair more body.
"
"
I'll admit it--I am very hard on my hair. It's baby fine, wavy and I bleach the hell out of it. Since it's so fine, I typically have to wash every day, which is wreaking havoc on the condition of my hair. A co-worker who has the same problem suggested this to me and I figured it was worth a shot. I've only been using for a few weeks, but can already feel a bit of a difference. The biggest thing you have to get used to is the lack of lather. I've been conditioned to think lather=clean, even though I know all those damaging sulfates are the only damaging my hair further. Due to this, I have a tendency to overuse the Deva Curl. I figure that will figure itself out with time. This stuff smells great, too. Overall great product.
"
"
The first time I used No-Poo, I had to pick the bottle up again to make sure I hadn't grabbed conditioner by mistake. I have *always* needed heavy conditioners for my colored, Botticelli-type curls. No more! This shampoo is so gentle and moisturizing that I can use a regular conditioner and be absolutely fine. Now, it doesn't suds up, which took some getting used to. Small price to pay for my hair being in vastly improved condition! At $18/12 oz bottle, it's a little pricey, but very worth it to me.
"
"
This is an absolute product for anyone who has curly hair.  I am so grateful that I was told about it.
"
"
this shampoo has no lather and you wonder if it really works, it does, noy hair feels and looks clean and what it does for my curls they look great!
"
"
Great product for naturally curly hair, but don't expect a lot of suds. Wonderful scent. Use with other Deva products.
"
"
It's a really nice product for dry curly hair. It hydrates curls and is even more moisturizing than the one condition surprisingly! After a few days the smell is making me sick though...
"
"
i absolutely love it, makes my hair feels real clean, need only small amount, not for people who think they need a lot of lather to get their hair clean
"
"
Hate the smell but it does seem to be both effective and gentle.
"
"
The fact that it does not lather is hard to get used to, but the hair washes nicely and does not over dry like regular shampoos.
"
"
This shampoo did wonders for my naturally dry, coarse, curly/wavy hair! I tried the no-poo baking soda/vinegar method for about four months, and finally getting fed up with the dandruff issues, I tried this. No more dandruff and my scalp and hair feel so clean and soft! I highly recommend this for anyone struggling with the no-poo thing. I now use this with the DevaCurl One Condition, and I'm never going back!
"
"
I have extremely curly hair and always have difficulty finding good shampoos. DevaCurl No-Poo has been a great find. My hair is much less frizzy, and the curls are much better defined. My scalp tends to be dry, but it is much better with this shampoo. The peppermint fragrance is really nice too.
"
"
Love DevaCurl products. The shampoo and conditioner are the best I have found for my naturally curl hair. Best curls of my life.
"
"
Amazing product! Highly recommended for anyone with curly hair.
"
"
Wonderful for curly hair, but I also use it when I plan to blow my hair out straight. It adds lots of body!! This shampoo leaves my hair in great condition!!
"
"
I was really worried with all the other comments about this product being fake but once I smelt, felt and used it, it was just like the one from the salon. The texture is perfect and not watered down, the smell is minty and I love it!!
"
"
I have very fine, very curly hair and recently jumped on the no-poo train. I started out with cheap Suave natural conditioner which was ho hum. A friend encouraged me to try this and wow what a difference. I love this stuff so much that I bought 2 - one bottle to keep at home and one for my gym bag.
"
"
My hair feels much softer after every use. I love this product.
"
"
Does not smell right at all and I have been using this shampoo for years now
"
"
Shampoo is a sham.  And poo.  Finding this product taught me that.  Like many, I was intrigued by the Wenn commercials, and like many, I wasn't keen to deal with Guthy Renker to get it.  DevaCurl No-Poo changed my life.  It makes my scalp tingle, makes my hair smell good and smooths my course, dry, frizz-prone hair beautifully.  A couple of things:* It's not just for curly girls.  I don't wear my hair curly, and it works great for me.* I find that I don't need the conditioner with it.  I have it but never use it.  I just use a leave-in styling product and I'm all good.* Since I've been using this product, I only have to wash my hair every 4-5 days.TRY IT.  I send sample sizes to my friends all the time, so I can be their hero.
"
"
Love this shampoo. Amazing how my hair looks. I have blonde straight medium length hair. It looks softer and very shiny. I will never buy another drug store brand.Recommend to everyone.
"
"
Makes my hair feel soft but not as clean as with a foaming shampoo. Will try the conditioner next
"
"
Everything DevaCurl makes is fantastic! My curls have never felt so luxurious!
"
"
I love love love love this product. It didn't dry my hair out like regular shampoos and my hair starting to curl as soon as I washed it. Great Product!!!!!
"
"
Will never use regular shampoo ever again.
"
"
I used to have the frizziest hair, EVA! I had no idea that it was my shampoo drying out my hair! Now that I stopped shampooing and started using No Poo, my hair is no longer frizzy! I have even thrown away all of my de-frizz products (of which I had plenty!!)...
"
"
I have very curly, kinky, frizzy hair and this wasn't for me.  on my curly days, my hair looked and felt weird and weighed down.  on my straight hair days, it didn't feel clean.  i think the no-poo route isn't for me.
"
"
This shampoo is absolutely fabulous. I love using it and just purchased the conditioner as well. Thank you Deva Curl.
"
"
This is the best smell ever! Almost like roses but not really. I love devacurl products so much that I’ve ordered them twice now. I’ve just started my curly hair journey and these have made the transition easier for me. I just wish they were more affordable.
"
"
I was so impressed by reviews I read about this brand that I ordered the whole line.  The only product that works well is the one condition conditioner.  I am very disappointed.
"
"
Have been using product for several years.
"
"
The best and only shampoo for curly hair!!!!!!!!
"
"
It was sort of odd washing my hair with shampoo that doesnt lather. It doesnt feel like your hair is getting clean and it takes much longer to wash the product than regular shampoo. I found that this made my hair feel very greasy. It may have been because I didnt remove all of the product...it did make my hair feel really soft. But the bad out weighed the good here for me. I have very long curly/wavy hair.
"
"
Finally my curly hair isn't stripped of all its moisture!  I absolutely love this product and does a great job for curly frizzy hair.  The lack of lather was concerning to me first because I'm so used to it but it left my hair cleaner than any other shampoo.  I really recommend this and I find myself having to use less product after showering to revive my curls.
"
"
Not Deva, not sure what this is. Returning for refund. Offensive smell
"
"
I can tell that this shampoo is detangling and moisturizing my hair when I use it. It doesn't smell great, but it does have a bit of a tingle on my scalp which makes me think it's cleaning my scalp since there are no suds.
"
"
I only wash my hair once or twice a week, after dancing for 4 hours in a smoky lounge, etc. Most regular shampoos blow up my hair shafts (because of coloring/streaking with foils every month?). This one doesn't have the nasty detergents that strip your hair. I use here and then when I've already used regular shampoo the day before, for ex. Mostly, I just massage my hair with the shower water most days. If you don't use lots of sprays, styling gels, etc., this is fine.
"
"
I think it controls the frizz but sometimes I just use a regular shampoo to feel totally clean.  I would be happier if it had no scent.
"
"
Awesome stuff1
"
"
it's okay
"
"
This product, like the conditioner is ok. Has a tingling sensation from the menthe which is nice. It doesn't lather and its not supposed to and that is weird to get used to. All in all ok.
"
"
Too bad I can't get my money back because if I could I would. I bought for my daughter & she hates it!!  I heard great things about this product & a friend sells it in her salon so maybe this isn't the original formula? Not sure, but I am sure my daughter hates it.  Waste of $30.00  Should've bought her the WEN, atleast I know it works & what to expect.
"
"
I use this on my 2 yos hair once a week.  It makes her smell like a grandma with too much perfume
"
"
My hair is less frizzy with this shampoo but the smell is toxic! It makes my hair smell like it has just been dyed at the salon. I had to put my hair up and away from my face because I was getting dizzy.
"
"
It is a nice shampoo, but I thought it would be especially good for naturally curly hair.  This week I tried using it on one side of my head and Suave ($2 for 12 oz!!) on the other side -- and can't really see any difference.
"
"
My stylist recommended this product to me several years ago before moving away from the area but I only recently decided to try it out.  Maybe the formula has changed since she recommended it because while I'm sure the ""no poo"" aspect of it would work out great for my naturally curly hair, the strong rose scent caused an instant headache.  I have scent sensitivities, especially with flowery scents, so the amount of fragrance in the product would have been helpful to know in advance. I would have chosen a different product.
"
"
I've been curious about Wen ever since I saw my first infomercial, but I did my research and found a lot of mixed reviews which scared me off.  I didn't want to go to the trouble of ordering and be disappointed.I saw a no poo formula by Salon Grafix and tried it thinking it might give me an idea of what to expect from a conditioning cleanser.  Horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  My hair was a nasty, greasy, tangly mess.  That scared me off the whole concept.Then my hairdresser suggested DevaCurl No Poo after I asked her about Wen.  She'd tried DevaCurl and liked it.  Her sister, also a hairdresser, uses Wen and likes it but uses No Poo if she runs out of Wen between shipments (they sell it at their salon).  I bought a trial pack and loved it immediately.  I was told I might have to use it for a while before the buildup washed out and my hair began to respond but for me the switch had instant results.  My scalp and hair felt clean, it smells wonderful, my hair is silky and not tangled...My hair is baby fine and tangles easily.  I have just enough curl in it to make styling a pain - I get either a rogue wave or a shirley temple curl within hours of straightening, and I'm prone to frizz especially in humid conditions.  With No Poo, the curls that surface are actually waves I can be happy about.  I even let my hair dry naturally and the ensuing curls were soft and looked intentional!I like One Condition also except it doesn't smell like the No Poo.  No Poo smells awesome, One Condition to me smells weird.  No idea why.I strongly suggest giving this a try if lather shampoos and other non-lathering conditioning cleansers have left you disappointed.  A small trial size is enough to find out if it will work for you.The difference may be the absence of silicone - it seems like a lot of the other cleansing cremes are full of chems including silicone, and silicone is a pretty greasy substance, something I would think would create buildup instead of remove it.Incidentally, I recently ran out of No Poo and tried the SG again and within two days the same results.  It went in the garbage.

I bought a sample size of this at ULTA. I initially thought that the perm smell in my shower was actually from the perm I'd recently gotten. But when my hair had dried I took another smell of the shampoo and it smells exactly like the chemicals from a perm. I'm not sure if it actually hurt my hair but it makes me a little wary to use a full bottle of it on my head. To be fair, I used the entire basic system on my curls and loved the results... but I am a little nervous about using it again. It was just a really strong and alarming smell.
"
"
I've been using it for two weeks now and will never use another shampoo again.  My hair is very short and not oily.  I bought the travel pack and experimented with all the products, but I ended up just using the shampoo and nothing more.  It feels great knowing I'm using a product without harsh chemicals.  My hair is finally soft, shiny and clean.Also, this is the first time EVER in my 45 years that I haven't had to use a conditioner in order to brush my wet hair without tears.  I can COMB my wet hair and I have zero tangles.  For you curly haired people out there, you already know this in itself makes this product worth it.If you want clean, fluffy hair with NO tangles, use just this product without the other products.  In my opinion, the other DevaCurl products are not needed and only add weight to your hair and make it feel heavy.EDIT 2-28-13:  I've now been using this for well over a year.  This week I had a sample of a lathering shampoo that I tried and my poor hair was so tangled and rough feeling.  I'm going home after work and wash this mess out and use my No-poo.  I hope it works as good for you as it does for me.  I'll never ever try lathering shampoo again.  Yuck!
"
"
I'd been doing no poo, meaning not using shampoo for quite a while.  I started doing this out of desperation, regular shampoo would dry my scalp and hair out, then turn my scalp greasy hours later.  My scalp was always itchy with shampoo, this stopped when I stopped using it.  When I started working out, I needed something to make my scalp feel clean.I love this product.  It smells wonderful.  It gets my scalp clean, I can feel it.  It doesn't strip all the oil out of my scalp or hair.  My hair is soft and happy.  My scalp is happy, too, no itch and no dryness.I do not have curly hair, I have very fine, thin, wavy hair.I love this product.If you use regular shampoo now and want to switch to this, give it a month before you decide if you like it or not.  The change away from harsh detergents can cause your scalp to seem extra oily - it's used to being stripped of all oils and needing to overproduce more oil out of desperation to protect itself.  Once it adjusts, you'll discover that you don't actually have an oil problem.

I've recently switched back from synthetic to human hair wigs, and I've found the thick, wavy texture challenging to keep in the right condition. Shampoo lightly to retain the curl, and the waves droop and look greasy. Shampoo too much to get it cleaner and it tangles something fierce, which leads to hair loss in an expensive wig.This non-foaming shampoo cleans the hair gently but completely, and leaves it silky-soft. The waves perk up, the hair shines, and everything swings naturally. I follow up with Lace Therapy's Detangling treatment and a quick spritz of either DevaCurl's Set it Free or Global Keratin's Hair Taming spray. It's like putting on a new wig every time I wash it.

I have really fine curly/wavy hair and the shampoo just weighed it down so much it looked greasy and weird.  I tried to use without the conditioner and it still left me with flat wavy weird hair.  I'm sure it's fantastic for someone with much thicker hair, but it just didn't do it for me.
"

Once I got over the awful eucalyptus smell I loved how the product controlled my frizz. After about 2 months of use my hair started falling out in big clumps. I went back to my previous product and after a couple of days the clumping stopped. I'm going to have to get about 8 inches chopped off my hair to fix the damage. A girl who I work with had also tried this product in the past and told me that she had the same issue.Not sure if I was shipped the same product as all the higher star reviewers or those reviews were posted prior to long term regular use but I would advise that the moment you notice some irregular clumping, immediately stop using this product.

This cleanser works very well on my 2b/c hair.  In the past, when I have tried to go without shampooing for a day, my hair became greasy and flat on top.  This cleans my hair & scalp very well, without harsh detergents.  I can skip conditioner after using this, because it is practically a conditioner itself.  My only quibble is with the fragrance.  It smells like roses - an old-fashioned scent I associate with my grandmother.  If the scent was nicer, or it maybe came with different fragrance options, I'd give it five stars.

I had been using typical drug store brands to where my curly hair was becoming a frizzy mess and not really curly anymore. I had done a lot of research and DevaCurl had a lot of really good reviews, so I picked some up. I wasn't impressed after the first few washes - I was wanting something that would have my hair hold out for a few days before washing it - but continued to use it anyway. After about a month my hair was still looking dirty on the second day when I normally only wash my hair every other day, which I continued to do anyway. It was somewhere around the month mark that my hair started falling out in clumps when I rinsed out the shampoo. More would come out when I worked the conditioner through my ends. Few more weeks and this continued, so I threw the rest away. I use Redken Curvaceous now and love it so much more.

PROS:* I LOVE this cleanser because it seems to clean AND moisturize without weighing my hair down or making it look super greasy - I've literally never used a product that manages to accomplish all of these things. (I have 2B/C waves - fine hair, a tendency toward both frizziness and greasiness) In short, this product makes my hair look absolutely fantastic.  Curly, tame, and not heavy or greasy.CONS:* The smell is hideous and strong.  Smells like a chemistry project.*  Build-up!  I do not use any styling products at all and only rarely use the One Condition (the No-Poo conditions enough for my hair) so it's not coming from anywhere but the shampoo!  I've never used a project that creates this much build-up.* Pricey!Also, I have no idea when this happened but it appears the formula changed?The DevaCurl website shows the ingredients list as follows:Water (Aqua, Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Laureth-4, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Propylene Glycol, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Triticum Aestivum (Wheat) Peptide, Avena Sativa (Oat) Peptide, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Peptide, Melissa Officinalis Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Menthol, Citric Acid, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Fragrance (Parfum)However, this product page shows the ingredients list as:Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Cymbopogan Schoenanthus Extract, Humulus Lupulas (Hops) Extract, Melissa Officinalis (Lemon Balm) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Flower Extract, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Laureth 4, Grapeseed Oil, Peppermint (Leaf) Oil, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Amino Acid, Soy Amino Acid, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben, Menthol, FragranceI wish it was still made with the older recipe because it is a much more artificial product now.I might go back to my old routine.Acure Organics Lemongrass + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo - moisturizing AND clarifying, smells divine and is a high quality natural productBeautiful Curls Curl Enhancing Shea Butter Leave-in - it's natural and smells like an absolute dream but requires a daily wash.

I've used over literally hundreds of different hair products. Deva curl no-poo is one of the few I have yet to change out of my rotation of different products. This is the only product so far that has kept my curls looking natural and full of life - as they should. My hair is always super soft, shiny and feels silky, just from this- Not even with the conditioner yet. Highly recommended to all curly hair types.
"
"
I have curly hair and have been ready to shave my head many times trying to deal with it! I FINALLY found a product that is wonderful! The girls at my salon told me to stick it out for a few weeks because I might not like it at first. The first time I used it-I hated it because my hair just felt greasy-but after a few more times and finally getting rid of the buildup that I had in my hair-I LOVE IT. My hair has never been so clean, bouncy and healthy. I use it everyday because it is gentle and I just scrunch it and let it air dry and my hair looks fantastic. WONDERFUL-try it.
"
"
DO NOT BUY THIS!!! This is a fake DEVACURLSHAMPOO IT SMELLS SO BAD AND DOESNT WORK. Your hair will feel the difference
"
"
Love this stuff! I️ have fine hair and I️ use this in between regular shampoos! Not crazy about fragrance but my hair is much healthier!!
"
"
I have herd about the Deva salon for over a year and have always straightened my hair because of the frizzy dry curls I was having. Eventually after being convinced by my mother to go to the Deva salon in White Planes and seeing what a difference it makes in your hair, it was hard not to buy the product. Every day I will wake up and use a little bit of this No-Poo product and message it only in the scalp of my hair to not make the ends dryed. Even though Deva is a product which is sulfate and sodium free you should never put a drop of shampoo on your ends, instead use the Deva conditioner after to hydrate you hair from top to bottom and feel your silky hair. I don't know what this brand puts in there products but what ever it is seems to be working amazing! For the first time in my life I finally have silky shiny hair while using this product,, definitely recommend. :)
"
"
Only used it once so far, but my curls are bouncy and shiny.  Also used their conditioner and foam.  Normally when I wake up in the mornings my hair is a frizzy mess. slept three nights in a row and my curls are still there happy and shiny.Love love love this stuff.
"
"
I started using no poo and within a month I had a scalp crust problem. My hairdresser told me that if you have wavy hair, or S waves, rather than denser curly hair this may not workFor you. My hair is medium oily and wavy this was not a fit for my hair. I really like loo poo,however and deva curl conditioner.
"
"
I really cannot say enough good things about this product. After years of battling my frizzy, dry curls, I had all but given up wearing my hair in anything other than a ponytail on a day-to-day basis. I saw amazing results after the first time I used this product-- my hair is soft and shiny and my bouncy curls look like I just stepped out of the salon, even after letting them air dry! Cannot recommend this enough to anyone who has given up on their curly hair.
"
"
I have dry, wavy hair with a lot of frizz in the summer months.  This product has worked wonders on my hair on all fronts.  My hair is soft, moisturized, and I dont have frizz or tangles anymore!  Its always good to buy one of devacurl's low-poo hair cleansers with the no-poo in my opinion.  Why?  Because after a few weeks of using just the no poo, my hair would start to feel a little heavy and weighed down.Why the 4 stars then you ask? The scent is a little strong, and I am still not used to it!  Its turkish rose and peppermint, and it seems to stick in my hair all day long. (low-poo has a lighter more fruity scent!)
"
"
Strange smell does not work well
"
"
If you have curly hair, this shampoo line by DevaCurl is a MUST HAVE. I have not tried the ""no poo"" yet, but I absolutely LOVE the low-poo! The scent is great, my hair and scalp are healthier than ever, and it's affordable! Tell your friends, too...they'll thank you!
"
"
After using DevaCurl cleanser and conditioner for almost 3 years, I of corse have an addiction because those make my hair really really soft, but my hair start falling a lot, of course everyone complains about this problem but I always had very nice hair, dryness was sometimes a problem but hair lose not.  Now after using this product for almost 3 years I noticed that half of my hair are gone it's almost twice as less as it used to be, even people around me will notice. I am absolutely healthy and now I keep wondering if the reason could be those DevaCurl products, or it's just  I just some kind of coincidence, I like my hair texture, but hair lose became a problem so I just wonder if anyone else is experiencing this kind of problem with this product. Thanks

My hairdresser got me a sample pack and urged me to try it. I was determined to hate the stuff - I thought I needed suds - and had to eat crow when I determined that I LOVE this stiff. I have naturally wavy/curly hair but never before could I make a daily style work - my curl was unreliable and could get frizzy. That all changed and after using the product for 4 months, I know I can never go back. Not only is my curl amazing now, I do not have to wash my hair every day like before. I can feel perfectly confident with the cleanliness of my har on day two. To top it off, I was experiencing acne style bumps in my hairline around my face which have all disappeared. I talked to an estetician and her explanation was that since my scalp and skin around the hairline were not being stripped of natural oils, they were not working overtime to replace the necessary oils which in turn let my skin settle down. I highly recommend this to anyone curly hair or not. I can't believe the compliments I get on my curls. My hairdresser even gets inquiries about getting a ""perm"" like mine. She replies that if she could perm like that, she would be a rich woman. Thank you Deva Curl and thank you to my hairdresser for forcing me to give it a try.

Does nothing for my curls
"
"
so great for curly hair
"
"
I've always had dry frizzy hair. With this product my curls have form and movement. I don't even travel without it anymore!
"
"
This product is affordable and smells great, but it does not work for me.  My curly hair tends to be oily at the roots and dry at the ends.  After only two days of washing my hair with Low-Poo, it had become weighed down and sticky.  If your scalp does not produce much oil, this product could work well for you, since it's very gentle on curls.  Otherwise you need a stronger shampoo.
"
"
I've had difficulty finding a good co-wash for my wavy hair. At first I was unsure because it left my hair feeling greasy underneath, as though it just wasn't cleaned at all. I figured devacurl was just way too heavy for my hair. After some googling, I realized that counterintuitively, I actually wasn't using ENOUGH of it when I was washing. I began using a whole palmful of it and my hair was left feeling clean and bouncy! If your hair feels weighed down and oily after use, I'd actually suggest using more during your wash and spending several minutes thoroughly scrubbing it out. I'm deducting a star because at the amount I have to use to clean my shoulder length hair, this stuff is getting very, very expensive. I have to use triple the amount of a regular shampoo, and this bottle is pretty tiny.
"
"
I bought this by mistake because Amazon made it appear that I purchased this item before. My bad for not checking. So, with a bit of hesitation, I decided to give the product a try since I use a lot of other Devacurl items. This by far is the worst. I don't usually wash my hair everyday because my hair gets dried out fast. I have naturally curly hair and my stylist knows how to cut it to enhance the curls, which I LOVE!  So, I started to notice that my curls were looking flat and my hair was getting straighter. I couldn't figure out what was going on, no matter what I tried to do to perk up the curls. I stopped using this product and went back to the Low-Poo Original Cleanser and my curls started coming back.  Sometimes it's trial and error with curly hair, but this product is not good for my curly hair, and I won't make this mistake again..
"
"
I purchased this because I was having to wash my hair everyday after exercising and my hair was getting really dry and looked unhealthy. My hair stylist suggested Deva Curl No-Poo (even tho my hair is straight & no curls), so I bought a travel size just to try it.I liked it so well I ordered the 12 oz. size and now I'm ordering the 32 oz.  I noticed my hair looked so much better when I used this I started using it more often and my other shampoo occasionally. You have to get used to no lather. I rub it in well and let it set a minute, then rinse it really really well. My hair has never looked healthier or shinier, I also don't have to use a conditioner. It just proves to me how much other shampoos dry out my hair and the ones I use are supposedly ""gentle"".  Probably won't work for everyone, but definitely worth a try.

I had a gift certificate from Christmas and really needed some new hair products.  I bought this, the conditioner to it, and the curl holding creme.I have very processed hair.  I dye it regularly and high heat wave, curl, or straighten depending on my mood.  It's shoulder length or more and somewhat thick.The shampoo does not lather.  It's not supposed to.  It's cleansing your hair.  If I didn't know this ahead of time, I'd  probably have freaked out and sent it back.  You work it through your hair and rinse.  I usually do this twice.  I don't care for the smell, but it doesn't matter because the conditioner smells great.  You work the conditioner through and leave it on as long as you need it.  A minute or ten, doesn't matter, it just depends on how deep you want or need your conditioning.  You can rinse it and then towel dry your hair and put a bit back in to stay.  It makes your hair soft and gives more hold, but I thought doing that made my hair feel heavy, but I did try it.  The creme hold stuff smells great too.  The hold is ""OK"".  That's why the 4 stars and not 5.  I'm reviewing the 3 products as a whole system overall.  The creme smells good, feels good, and I even rubbed my hands on my face after running it through my hair.  It made such a good lotion.  I found that my curls needed the occasional touch up if I were going out, or had something going on in the evening.  I didn't need to add more, just needed to touch up my hair a bit.This stuff blows your average department store products away.  I like biolage better, but can't afford it.  But this is better than then the Nexxus products.  The shipping was quick with Prime and on time.  Packaging was fine.  Bottle is simple, plain, not gimicky, if you know what I mean.  I would buy more, try some other of their products, and recommend this product.
"
"
I see how some people would like this product, and while it did seem to make my curls more manageable, I just could not stand my hair always looking greasy and dirty.  After about 2 weeks of use, I went back to my old sulfate shampoo.  Yeah, I look more frizzy, but only marginally, and my hair feels clean.  With this, I never felt clean.  Maybe I'll give this another go sometime in the future, but for now I can't do it.  I did not look ""professional.""I do like the smell of it, however, and have mixed it with my regular shampoo on occasion for that nice smell.I do still use the conditioner, and that works well for me, and fights off a bit of the frizz.
"
"
No-Poo is a wonderful conditioning cleanser that is very gentle on my hair.  I have long, straight hair that's bleached blonde, then highlighted, so it's pretty stressed and dry.  This cleanser (I can't call it a shampoo) leaves my hair clean, soft, and silky. I highly recommend it to help restore your hair if it's damaged or dry.  It took a little getting used to - at first it felt like I was rubbing conditioner on my hair because I was used to lather.  But I've used it for over a year and now I cringe when I use regular shampoo. This is a terrific product!
"
"
I’ve used this before when I was in my 20s and it worked great for the thicker hair days. Now in my 30s and having had kids my hair isn’t what it used to be.  I still have curly hair but it’s finer. Was hoping this stuff would help. Nope. Just makes it flatter and less full. I will say it helps a bit with humidity issues though.
"
"
I like the way it makes my hair feel, very soft, and it helps with frizzies, since I only wash every 3rd day.  Not thrilled with the smell though...it kind of smells like perm solution.
"
"
Have curly hair?  Went through a million and one product to either calm them down or just the keep them tamed long enough to get though the day!? Or you're just trying to get those luscious curls back?? Devacurl is the best product if you have curly hair. It revives the curls and gives your curls the bounce that it needs and cleans out everything and restoring your curls to its natural state! Plus It smells amazing! I'm very happy with this product and if you want to find out more about it youtube..

"
Nice low suds cleansing conditioner, hair stylist suggested it for my dry hair and it makes sense that I don’t need the detergent which dries my hair more, no sulfates , parabens is a plus. Cleans as well as regular shampoo, I got used to no suds
"
"
The only complain if u have as much hair as me, long curly hair with lots of volume u will use alot
"
"
I don't know why this is different than before, but the scent is different and it irritated my scalp. With the issues happening right now with Deva curl and long time users, I'm done with this brand.
"
"
So I am a Caucasian female with fine sometimes-wavy/mostly straight hair but was looking for a ""no-poo"" shampoo to avoid sulfates and other nasty chemicals. I really like this product and it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean! I'd recommend it. The smell is ok, not the best. Reminds me of cold cream.
"
"
This is the best product I have ever used.  I have really curly hair and everything else left my hair frizzy and dry looking.  As there is no lather, this shampoo doesn't strip the natural oils out of your hair (which curly hair has little of to start with).  It's a bit odd at first to wash without seeing a lather and your brain wants to say ""no lather/foam = not clean"" but it really does get your hair clean without the lather.  I use the No Poo and the Deva Curl One Conditioner.  I also chose to use the DevaCare Arc AnGell Extra Hold Conditioning Gel as it seemed my hair needed a little more hold than the regular gel provided.  The gel holds my curl without getting stiff and crunchy.  My hair has never looked or felt better than it does with these products.
"
"
This shampoo is not designed to clean the oil from your scalp but it does clean product residue.  If you have oil production in your scalp you might like Low Poo shampoo better, by Diva because NO poo doesn't lather AT ALL, it's like a cleansing lotion.  I have very dry skin and scalp and am very glad there's a product that I can use to clean the product residue without leaving my hair drier than it already is.
"
"
Okay, I expected much more out of it.  I used it faithfully, but really didn't notice it bringing out any curl or cleaning my hair any better.
"
"
I recently stumbled upon the curly girl method and I love this no poo cleanser.  It cleans my hair and leaves it smelling great.  If you're into the no poo movement, you may be put off by a commercial product, but for us curly girls, this does the job and hydrates my curls without drying them out.  If you're new to the no poo movement, you may have to use more often gradually weaning off every day cleaning.  I can go three or four days between washes (now...after the transition period while my scalp adjusted to less cleansing).  I use a refresher mist in the mornings to clean up the shape of it and go.  Would def recommend this product.
"
"
I love DevaCurl products so I'm happy I bought this item.  Just be warned though that this product is DevaCARE and not DevaCurl.  So the bottle is really white and not green.  I'm sure the product does the same thing as the original but the photo is wrong. Either way, the product is great and Deva products work well for my hair!
"
"
slight variation in the ingredients when compared with salon product.  Packaging identical.  Seems the same in texture, smell.  Felt the same when using, saw no difference.
"
"
Original cleanser bought from amazon just remember its a cleanser not shampoo so you need to work the scalp up towards roots and rinse with cool water
"
"
This may be odd to some people who are used to regular types of shampoo that have sulfates and other drying out chemicals in it but this stuff really cleans your hair. Shampoo lathers because of all the chemicals added, this no poo cleanser doesn't lather since its sulfate free which is awesome for curly hair. Doesn't dry out my curls and smells good too.
"
"
I have mid-back length blonde, wavy, coarse, thick hair. I had been using Wen and wanted to try a few other condition only washes and/or no-poos.  This was the first I'd tried after WEN, thinking this may do more for my waves. Wasn't very impressed. Hair felt dry and it actually seemed to make my hair straighter rather than curlier.If your hair needs a bit more conditioning/moisturizing I would not recommend this unless you follow it up with a leave-in treatment.This may do more for people with much curlier hair, but if all you have is wave, I'd try something else.
"
"
I love Deva Curl no poo shampoo. I use it and the conditioner. My hair is more wavy/curly and the Deva Curl products give my hair that bouncy casual look.
"
"
Product cap was open and leaking.  1 skimpy piece of tape over the cap doesn't work. After all the reviews regarding this issue, why isn't the bottle wrapped?
"
"
I am now officially a convert to No-Poo. It takes a little while to get used to not having lather and I'll admit I do miss that nice soapy feeling while washing my hair. But it's worth it. My hair feels so good after using this stuff and it's less frizzy too! I also notice my scalp doesn't get itchy anymore either - I guess cause I quit drying it out with those regular shampoos. Anyway, give this a try. I didn't experience any of the extra oiliness that one reviewer mentioned. But my hair tends to be on the drier side.
"
"
Great cleanser! I've tried all the conditioning cleansers and this one is by far my favorite.  Wen was okay, but too expensive, and it made my hair fall out after using it too much.  As I Am Coconut Co-Wash is great, too, but it left my hair feeling a little too greasy.  This one is a decent price and leaves my hair looking normal and clean. It smells great, too.
"
"
I like the product, however - the scent is overwhelming. The shampoo does good things for my curls, but dang, it's just so strong that if I wash my hair at night, the perfume in the shampoo keeps me up. I walked into work the next day and people 3 desks away commented on how strong it was. I'll have to mix it with other shampoo just to get through the bottle. Unfortunately, I won't be buying it again.
"
"
My daughter is biracial and has very tight curls, her hair doubles in length when its wet.  I am amazed how well this works for us.  I take the ""shampoo"" and really work it into her hair and scalp and it's like magic, I can run my fingers through her hair.  I follow it up with the conditioner and the gel and her hair has less frizz and the curls are defined.  It's important to use the products as directed to see the results.
"
"
I use this a few times a week and also use one condition and deva's gel.  This stuff makes my hair feel strange.. dry right from rinsing  and if I don't rinse and condition the next day my hair gets stinky which has never happend before.  Very disappointed in this product but love many others in the DevaCurl line.  On a plus, I like the smell.
"
"
This shampoo is great for curly hair. Like many gals out there, I've pretty much have tried EVERYTHING, even the high price/name brand products and none work as well as curl deva. The 12 oz. bottle lasted quite a while because I would only need about a quarter size for every wash. My hair did get a little greasy at first because I was used to using the typical large glob of other brand shampoo to get a good wash. I've ran out and I miss it already! It leaves your hair silky smooth, helps decrease frizz and helps with styling. I think I'm a customer for life...and honestly I'm not going back. Love curl deva!
"
"
My normally extremely frizzy hair is now tamed, my fine hair has never been able to hold a curl for more than 12 hours (without a lot of product) and the curls would fall out into waves immediately if touched.  Now my hair remains curled for a day and a half (even after sleeping on it), and I can put a shirt on or run my hands through my hair and still have curls afterwards.  So if you have really fine curly hair that normally ends up as wavy a couple of hours after it dries, this product may improve the health of your hair enough to allow it curl and hold shape like it did mine.
"
"
I've spent years trying to find a shampoo for my fine, frizzy hair and sensitive skin. I can finally say I've found it! Wow, what a difference in my curls!
"
"
Product has a great clean smell, and has worked great so far.  I have very fine hair and this product has helped my split ends.
"
"
I have frizzy hair, a cross between curly and wavy, and got this thinking it would define my curls more. My hair is very, very thick though, and though this product did eliminate frizzies, it also weighed my hair down, making it almost flat (but curly, flat curls). It took away the body of my hair. I only used it a few times, then stopped.Beware if you have heavy, thick hair!
"
"
I was very excited to use this as soon as it arrived. I have shoulder blade length hair and using 2tsp was enough for me. Make sure hair is evenly  wet before distributing No-Poo since it does not create foam as with typical shampoo product. I didn't  feel like my hair was dirty like another review mentioned. The bottle size is fair for all I needed to use. I am not planning on using it everyday because I'm  going  curly  girl method and the reason I purchased in the first place.
"
"
This shampoo is decent but I wouldn't staple it just yet. It does clean and lather well, but I'm still hunting for the best sulfate free poo for my hair. I could see it being amazing for someone else. To each it's own. Eh, okay for me.Ok, Update:I recently tried this shampoo again and loved it...stapling. Can't remember what I did differently but it cleaned well and didn't leave my scalp itchy like sulfate shampoos do.
"
"
I have grown accustom and love Deva Curls products, only con I have with the No Poo is that it is a cleanser and not a shampoo which I am accustom to. This means that there is no lather in washing hair, it is like rubbing cream for shampoo in your hair. This is my personal opinion.However, I love that the product tingles a lovely minty or citrus feeling and scent when rubbed into scalp, feels refreshing.
"
"
I was introduced to this product by a fellow curly-headed friend. I've never found anything like it. My curls have increased, and my frizziness disappeared. Since I've been using this product, I get compliments on my hair from colleagues and from strangers. I feared that something this good would cost too much, but it fits comfortably within my budget. Thank you, Deva Curl.
"
"
Great product for curly girls - no lather cleanser is important to not dry out curly hair and this product is highly recommended by my stylist so I was happy to find it on Amazon. The only thing that would have made me happier would be to find Amazon selling it directly so I could utilize my Prime membership and get free shipping.
"
"
Deva Curl product was doctor recommended. I have been using this for years and I love how well it works with my curly hair it makes it feel smooth and oh so soft. It’s a bit expensive but worth it. I am allergic to sulfa and Deva products are sulfa free. The No Poo is good for dry and damaged hair. Deva works great for me!!!
"
"
Terrific for my curly hair.
"
"
Best product ever for my multi-racial children/boys.  It's light and cleans well.  They are teenagers and very active so they cleanse 3 times per week.  And they have very FAST growing 3b wavy/big ringlets hair type.  They use this in conjunction with other items in this product line for well conditioned, adequately moisturized hair/scalp that is neither goopy, greasy, or crunchy.  Their hair is shiny and their curls are well defined.  (I use it also on my LONG, fine, 4a natural Black hair with great results -- however I use Aussie moist conditioner, followed by sealing my ends with grape seed oil/sweet almond oil and finish up with Oyin Handmade Hair Dew for moisture and defined coilies.  The Hair Dew I use each morning!).
"
"
so far so good
"
"
Love Deva Curl products. They are the only hair line I use now, and my hair has drastically improved. Very moisturizing line, you just have to figure out which combination works best for you.
"
"
I've tried many products for my curly hair and always keep coming back to this one.It's rich, creamy, smells great and doesn't contain any drying, damaging sulphates or other chemicals.
"
"
For a curly girl it would be hard to find a better product. Because of my curl type I cleanse my hair twice a week with this product and then follow up with the OneCondition. With this product less is always more and I find a little goes a long way.  Check out the 3-step cleansing routine at devachansalon.com.
"
"
Really cleansed my hair and conditioned it as well.  Smells like lemon cake!  The more I use this the better I like it. I will repurchase this and the One Condition in the larger sizes.I will recommend this to my daughter, and her curly friends and mine.  I have used several what I would call luxury products, Curl Junkie, Oyin, Darcy's Botanicals, all good.  But for everyday cleansing and moisture I will use Deva Curl.  My hair just styles and behaves better.I will try the jell when I re-order.

GREAT  CONDITIONER  1/2 THE PRICE .

My daughter has super curly hair and loved this when I bought it. It keeps her hair curly with minimal frizz.
"
"
Works really well and great for anyone with frizzy hair
"
"
If you're going no poo this is a great shampoo to use! All the products in this line are designed for curly hair but can be used on any hair! They are all 100% paraben, sulfate, and silicone free!
"
"
It's the best shampoo for curly hair. I tried Davine Love Curl before but it couldn't make my hair curly and shine at all. So, I search more shampoo for curly hair and find this one. DevaCurl makes you hair so soft after you wash your hair. Also, it makes your curly hair more curly. I use this for more than 3 years. I need to carry this shampoo every country I need to travel for work.
"
"
Great product.
"
"
No more frizz! SLS-free, smells amazing, and cleans better than shampoo; it doesn't strip my hair of its natural sheen.  I also now only have to wash my hair every few days, I can go up to 3 days without getting that ""greasy"" feeling.  Wonderful change!
"
"
I have been using this product for over 2 years now, and just recently decided to try something different.  It has convinced me beyond a doubt, that this is the best product for my hair.  It leaves it clean, soft and super curly.  I will never stray from it again.
"
"
I love this stuff- shampoo, conditioner, both- whatever you want to call it- it's great on my fine (but there's tons of it), slightly dry, red-dyed hair.  If you know color, you know that red is the hardest of all colors to keep fresh and No-Poo helps my color stay so vibrant that when I went to get my hair done last week my colorist said ""If you didn't have roots, I'd think you had gone to someone else (for a dye job).""  Another thing that REALLY helps is my Aquasana Water Purifier for my shower.  It takes out all of the chlorine and other chemicals that are tough on one's hair.  It's made a huge difference in conjunction with the No-Poo.  I highly recommend it.
"
"
Love how it does not dry my hair out like other shampoos. Leaves it shiny and frizz free. doesn't smell great but not bad. Will buy again.
"
"
Okay, I *just* used this again today, like 3 hours ago. I've had it for months & seriously dislike it.For one, it smells disgusting. It's overpoweringly intense - like nausea/migraine inducing. Basically, it smells exactly like some cheap, vile, powdery-floral bathroom spray. Not too crazy about my head smelling like a public toilet.It does not do anything remotely impressive for my hair. In fact my hair feels sort of rough & tangly. I have used plenty of other cheap conditioners for CO-Washing, many cone-free, and have been way more impressed with the results. (I'm talking $1 conditioners like V05 or Suave, that you can find dirt cheap at K-Mart, Target, Wal-Mart, drug stores, etc...)Save your money & just get something else. I would never buy this again, nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.
"
"
Very gentle, and does a great job with my damaged hair--it feels softer, silkier, and looks shinier after a couple weeks of using this product. It doesn't dry it out and helps tame frizz as a result. Definitely worth the money!
"
"
Pros:Conditioning, good detangler, nice subtle scent, creamyCons:price, (update 3/25--can't use this on my scalp)The product is creamy and white like a conditioner.The scent and feeling is somewhat comparable to Giovanni organic shampoo.I have a combination of coily and course hair textures. I didn't think this would do anything for me. I've heard people say it didn't leave their hair feeling stripped like normal shampoos, but it left their hair tangled?This did no such thing to me. I tried it on my scalp and while it smelled good and I could feel the peppermint sensation working, I didn't give me a clean feeling on my scalp. (UPDATE 3/25: This product made my scalp itchy. I thought it wasn't cleaning properly but I was having some kind of reaction to the ingredients and my scalp was so itchy the next day. I made the mistake of using this again and had the same itchiness after my shower. I finally realized it was the product by the 3rd use but I love this product too much to stop using it, I just won't be putting it on scalp anymore. I had to use a different cleanser after using this and the conditioner and my scalp felt so much better).On my hair, however, this worked wonders. I don't know what possessed me to try to detangle with something that is supposed to be used in place of shampoo but I did and this instantly became my favorite detangling product. I smoothed it from roots to tips with about 1tbsp of product per section (I had many sections-at least 4) and began finger detangling. If my ends felt too dry (even though I saturated my hair with water prior) or when my hair wouldn't separate, I added more of the No Poo and my ends melted apart and my curls started to pop.I couldn't believe this was all from the No Poo.After I rinsed it, my hair felt somewhat conditioned and fresh. Soft, smooth, and clean. My scalp felt so/so. I used an apple cider vinegar rinse to massage on my scalp just to be safe then I used the One Conditioner. Unfortunately, I preferred the No Poo over the Conditioner. One Condition didn't do anything special, the scent is horrendous, so I winded up using my Silk18 conditioner to help it out.After I was done washing my hair, I noticed I used way more of the No Poo than the conditioner and that doesn't typically happen. I am in love with the stuff. will be buying again.If anyone knows a better devacurl conditioner for coily and course hair let me know. Thanks.
"
"
You have to buy this product or you are missing out.
"
"
I have very thick, frizzy, curly hair that I now get straightened. I decided to try this shampoo because the lady who straightens my hair recommended it. I am glad i did. It leaves my hair shiny and soft and it is helping prolong the life of the Brazilian blowout..
"
"
My hair is definitely more moisturized, even without using the conditioner. I have been using the Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defining Gel and the two together work well. I think my next purchase is the diffuser to set the curls.
"
"
This is the shampoo of my choice. I LOVE the scent and the creamy texture.Even though it is a shampoo, it moisturizes my hair! I don't use it all the time. I use it about once a week. This is all the shampoo I need. Thanks Amazon and DevaCurl!
"
"
It seems to clean very well and leaves my hair feeling nice and soft. It relaxes some of my curls, but still can't tame the frizz. I don't really like the smell. Seems a bit matronly.
"
"
Got this for my one of daughters with wavy curls and she loved it. She said it made her hair feel fresh and clean and not weighed down. It also gave her natural curl  pattern (2c /  2b) more definition without the frizz. It smells like roses too. Ordering here was a lot cheaper here than it is at Ulta too.
"
"
My favorite hair care brand.
"
"
I use this once a week during the winter and every other day during the summer.  It's creamy (no suds) and rinses out complete.  It doesn't dry out my hair and it keeps my scalp clean and moisturized.  Fantastic product.
"
"
As a curly haired woman, I love this cleansing conditioner! You will have to get used to it not lathering in your hair the way regular shampoo does but afterwards, your hair will feel great! Mine did! Nice and soft after washing it out. Not rough the way some shampoos leave your hair feeling.
"
"
This shampoo has a nice scent but it does not create suds which I knew ahead of time.  Has an odd feel to it when shampooing the hair, since there are no suds and it makes me wonder if my hair is really getting clean.  Certainly different.
"
"
Great cleanser. Doesn’t strip my hair of its natural oils and vitamins.
"
"
Just to start off, I gave this 4 stars because I don't know how to judge the product since I've never used anything that has no lather to it. I have naturally curly hair that gets dry quick so after hearing about this product, I thought I'd give it a try.  It definitely doesn't lather so in the back of my mind, I'm wondering if it even works.  It has a nice minty aroma and it leaves the hair seemingly clean although I don't know if it completely cleans the scalp.  I think next time I may try the one called ""Some Poo"" that has a little lather to it.
"
"
I know people always rave about DevaCurl, and I'm here to tell you there's good reason. Honestly, it's worth the money. My curls are healthy, happy, and hydrated.
"
"
I have very dry hair that is colored. I was using the TV brand but it's too expensive.. This shampoo fit the bill. The pirce is good and it didn't dry out my hair I aslso can skip conditioner
"
"
Deva Curl is a great line for curly haired little ones!  I like the gentleness of this product.
"
"
these products are great for my curly hair (I am 69 years old!!!)  wish I had found them sooner.  LOVE having fewer chemicals in my hair.
"
"
perfect
"
"
purchase for my granddaughter with trouble hair.  seen a little help but not really worth the cost
"
"
I was sceptical about this whole ""no-poo"" business, but my curls were getting drier and frizzier as my hair got grayer. I bought the 12 oz bottle and thought I'd give it to the bottom of the bottle to see how it worked. I still have a quarter of the bottle to go but I'm back to buy the biggest bottle I can find. This stuff is a miracle for my hair! I can actually go longer between ""shampoos"", and as the humidity increases as we go into summer my hair is getting curlier, not frizzier! I use Paul Mitchell The Conditioner as my leave-on conditioner, and between washings I run my wet fingers through my hair, then run a dab of conditioner through the curls to tame any outliers. I have found the perfect combination of products for my hair!
"
"
I am super frugal by nature but I will actually pay extra for this product. love the smell of it.
"
"
I thought Id give the DEVA CURL NO POO a shot. Ive only tried DEVA CARE NO POO in the past and thought I would try something a little different. It works fairly well. It is  the only no poo I am using at the moment. It leaves my fine shoulder length type 3 curly hair moisturized. However I do not like the rose scent and get better detangling and even more moisture from DEVA CARE NO POO. In fact I can skip DEVA CURL ONE CONDITION with the DEVA Care and go straight to styling if I choose. I also prefer its citrus scent. Good stuff but Ill be sure to order the DEVA CARE NO POO when  I run out.
"
"
This shampoo does help to keep my curls more intact and bouncy but not as clean as I would like. Also have to make sure to hydrate my hair with Rosemary oil more frequently because I noticed that after shampoo-ing it does need a little ""pick me up""
"
"
Great for dry curly swimmers hair. Wonderful scent, leaves hair soft and manageable.
"
"
Love this stuff, it works wonders for hair and is the only cleanser that I can use for months and my hair not grow tired of it.
"
"
Did fine, but left a slight odor in my hair when I wear it in a ponytail.
"
"
I have very fine and very dry curly hair, and shampoo is too harsh for me so I tried this product and it worked perfect. It cleaned my hair nicely. I highly recommend it and will buy it again.
"
"
Gentle on my hair but I need to use way more because it does not lather & I have really long hair. Need 2 to 1 (shampoo vs conditioner) (i mean, no-poo).
"
"
I love this, made my hair feel clean without all the lather. Smelled great too!
"
"
Great cleaning for my 3A curls.  Makes my scalp feel fresh and clean and no frizz that I get from 'real' shampoo lather.
"
"
Have used nothing but Deva for 8 years! Never going back.
"
"
Works well on my wavy, not terribly curly hair.  I tried the Lo-Poo but find No-Poo give me more curl.
"
"
Couldn't find a better No Poo for your hair...Would definitely recommend this product, and do. Very fresh & clean.Thank you
"
"
I've been using this product for almost 2 years and my hair has never looked better. I have VERY curly hair. My hair never looks or feels dried out (and I swim daily in a lake over the summer), and I love the smell.
"
"
This is not my favorite shampoo but it ranks better than any drugstore or regular store shampoo! It does have things in it that is better on curly hair so I like it!
"
"
This shampoo allows my hairs natural wave and curl to come to life.  It is so gentle to my uber sensitive skin and has a very delicate, botanical fragrance that is so pleasant.  And I am very hyper-sensitive to many  fragrances.Once you realize that it won't ""suds"" up like other shampoos do but still leaves your hair and scalp clean it's addicting to use.  My hair is softer than it has been in years and shiny.  People think I had a perm or a ""glossing"" treatment.  And color added.  Nope.  Just healthy hair.  Finally!!I would recommend reading the ""Curly Girl"" book that goes with this product line.  I really was convinced I had straight hair.  And needed perms for this amount of curl.  And had to keep dying my hair for shine and color (middle-aged blah hair syndrome).
"
"
While there is no lather I work the lotion in well and rinse. It leaves my hair soft.  My hair was damaged from meds for my breast cancer and this shampoo really helped it. I like the smell. A good friend uses the shampoo for straight hair and loves it.
"
"
Love this product. and the price was great.  works great with deva conditoner
"
"
Good product for my curly hair. Gives me extra day without drying curls with shampoo. Liked the look, soft curls.
"
"
LOVE the Deva line of products!!
"
"
my daughter loves this stuff.  very long hair prone to breakage, mostly because she refuses to cut it, but it's done wonders for her.
"
"
Works well on my 2b/3c curls.  I feel like it cleans my har well enough but I still use a stronger more clarifying shampoo a couple of times a month.  I like the smell but I can see how some people might find it obnoxious. Wish it didn't cost so much!
"
"
Love it! My hair feels clean & hasn't shed anywhere near as much as before.
"
"
Great for curly hair.
"
"
This is a great shampoo, even with no bubbles.  Gets hair clean and shiny.  Feels super good!
"
"
I have reactive scalp to all shampoos I've previously used. DevaCurl did not make my scalp turn red.  Could be lack of sulfates.  I'm very happy with this shampoo.
"
"
No Poo is great!
"
"
it leaves my hair shiny and nice frizz free condition..love the curls......and even smooth I love it. it is soo shiny
"
"
great item
"
"
Makes my curly-haired 3 year old's hair smell and look great! Keeps her curls bouncy and tame.
"
"
Great product
"
"
I didn't like the product.  I like the lo-poo better.
"
"
This product worked great for my hair when it was short.
"
"
No shampoo, bar none, smells as womderful. A joy to wash my hair. Great for dry curly hair.
"
"
Leaves a nice smell to your hair but does not weigh it down.  Makes curls behave when used with other products in this line.
"
"
Smells great, feels like conditioner but gets the job done.
"
"
I went to the salon and got the trial size and it's been doing wonders for my hair so I ordered the full bottle. I never leave my hair curly any more cuase it never does what I want it too but with this product I did and it looked great.
"
"
Having extremely curly hair, I've been advised not to wash and use conditioner like non-curly-haired people. This product smells good and leaves my hair clean without turning it into a dried frizzy mess.
"
"
THis is the best product for curly hair.  It keeps hair soft and manageable.  I use it regularly with other Devalporudct.
"
"
Great hair cleanser. A staple product for any curly hair. A little goes a long way. try it out and you will never get shampoo again.
"
"
great natural product
"
"
Good as advertised.
"
"
I was excited to read all the reviews about this product and had high hopes. I didn't work for me. I have a lot of thick, ""botticelli"" curls. I used a whole bottle of No-Poo and honestly didn't notice any difference. I also didn't get used to the fact that there is no foam. I kinda like foam...But the worse, really, is the smell. It smells like cheap perfume, like roses and it's too overpowering. Not buying again.
"
"
Love all things devacurl.
"
"
DevaCurl is literally the only product I will use on my hair regularly. I hate going on vacation with my hair products! The No-Poo is great for curly hair and wavy alike. Once you get over the idea of suds in your hair, you will love this. Just don't use No-Poo if you have really thin hair, as it can weigh it down and cause it to appear greasy. Tip: Run your fingers through your hair while it still has the product in it, and then DO NOT brush after applying OneConditioner. This keeps your curls intact, and frizz to a minimum.
"
"
I like that I can order online.  This shampoo does wonders for my hair without taking the curls away.  Hurrah!
"
"
My only problem with this shampoo is that I find my hair is greasy the next day. But I otherwise love the shampoo, great smell and I can use it with out a conditioner.
"
"
It is a nice product for once or twice a week, It tended to weigh it down a bit with daily use, but it does feel great and enviromentally kind...I would have it on hand for sure!
"
"
Smells great!
"
"
I was so excited to use this. After my first use, I realized I probably should  have purchased the conditioner too. My hair was so dry and bleh. I do love the smell and the tingly feeling of the peppermint oils. It feels weird not to lather my shampoo. I really don't notice a difference in my hair being ""cleaner"" or not. I guess I really will have to see if there is a difference with the conditioner.
"
"
I love it.  My hair can get a little dry sometimes from blowing drying and color.My hair looks and feels much too.
"
"
I like how it makes my hair feel, but I'm not a huge fan of the smell! People definitely notice a difference in how your curls look!!
"
"
Left my hair limp.
"
"
I got my hair analyzed and was told that this shampoo would work for my extremely course hair.  I never really spent lots of money on hair products but I'm so glad I splurged on this one.  It works great!  I couldn't believe how easy it was to comb my hair out after using it. So far it's the best shampoo I've tried.  I would recommend this product to anyone with course hair for its conditioning properties.
"
"
Along with the other products, conditioner and light hold, it woks great on my daughters hair, really helps with the frizziness
"
"
I have thick, grey hair that is very coarse. Usually it is just a frizzy mess. I think I have tried almost every shampoo and conditioner there is and now finally I think I have found something to help. It does not lather and even without the conditioner my hair feels better. I also purchased the Deva Curl One Conditioner. The only problem I have is getting it out of the bottle!
"
"
Shampoo bottle packed in an envelope and much of the contents of the bottle leaked out. This should have been packed in  box to protect it. Expensive product that it largely not useable. Why would I waste my time to send back a partial bottle of shampoo. A BIG FREAKING MESS!!I will not order from this seller again and AMAZON needs to heed this advice as well.
"
"
Love Deva curl. Works great
"
"
I bought the No Poo, DevaCare One condition and the DevaCurl Deva Care Arc Angell. This line of product definitely makes my curls look gorgeous! They're more defined and my husband constantly tells me it looks sexy haha I get compliments from people often! My only gripe is that I believed all frizz would be eliminated but I still have quite a bit of frizz. I use the right type of dryer too (which I don't use every single time). I'm hoping it's because I've only been using this stuff for 2 1/2 weeks and I know it takes up to 6 weeks to see a total transformation. I'm a fan of the shampoo and gel smell but I do not like the smell of the conditioner. It reminds me of my grandma's Dove soap lol  I will continue to purchase these hair products and I'll update my review after 6 weeks! :)
"
"
I bought this one and the deva girl set it free. Best combo out there. It leaves hair curly and untangled for the entire day. I go to school and my hair is exposed to all sorts of weather every day and yet my hair is soft and untangled! I do use a GENEROUS amount of the shampoo on my hair. It does not create foam which one has to get used to.
"
"
Works great for my hair!! Love the fresh smell
"
"
I use this with the curl one conditioner and this is a great product. I live at the shore and this tames my hair and it leaves it really soft and shiny.
"
"
I don't like the way my scalp feels after using this. I prefer the Evercurl conditioning shampoo. So I won't buy this again.
"
"
The shampoo smells great, has no sulfates and it does not strip your hair like regular shampoo.  Keeps my dry curly hair in check
"
"
Love the clean feel. Has a healthy feel and pleasant fragrance.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo works wonders.  It leaves my hair extra curly without the extra gel/mouse products.  I also notice that when I use it my hair doesn't get frizzy.
"
"
Satisfied with this product. It left my hair smelling fresh and clean and left my hair managable for it being so curly
"
"
I LOVE DevaCurl.  Me and my hair are addicted to the products!  I have been using Deva for a little over a year and highly recommend ALL curly girls to make the change to DEVA!  LOVE IT!
"
"
I wanted to try the ""no-poo"" method of washing my hair, but this didn't work for me. It might work for other people, but this left my hair unclean and greasy. I think that your hair has to get used to these kinds of products over time. It does have a nice smell though that isn't too overpowering.
"
"
Arrived quickly and great product.
"
"
Easy on the scalp.Living in Chicago where winter is COLD and heat in homes/offices HOT...poor scalp and hair takes a beating. I use this occasionally, to give my hair a rest.The husband used it to get his scalp to STOP itching. It worked for him.
"
"
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE FOUND A PRODUCT TO CALM MY CURLY HAIR, IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR MY HAIR AS WELL.
"
"
Love Deva Curl products!
"
"
it doesn't lather which is perfect.  it keeps my hair clean and not dry. so far so good.  love it!  item still hasn't arrived after contacting the seller regarding the issue.  now, i just want a refund.
"
"
Love what this does for my fine, wavy hair.  I used to dread shampoo day but this makes it much, much less painful.  And my hair is softer too.  My hair stylist asked why use a shampoo that suds if my face cleanser doesn't?  Good point: bubbles = drying.  I'm converted.
"
"
I threw this away, as my daughter had the same product.  It left her hair stringy and oily so I did not bother to use it.  I also did not return it as shipping it back would almost equal the cost of the product.
"
"
the best
"
"
I have wavy hair that likes to frizz. My hair stylist suggested I try a no poo wash for my hair. This is the first product of this type that I have used. It works great keeping my hair from frizzing, however, my hair feels so greasy and dirty and has been falling out. I wash my hair before bed, it feels clean when I fall asleep but wake up with it feeling dirty. I don't understand how someone with really curly hair could use this and not wash for a week.Will not purchase again.
"
"
I purchased this by accident - wanted the devacare no-poo.  Do not buy this if you are allergic/sensitive to fragrance, which I am.  It has a very strong, chemical fragrance smell (to my nose, anyway).  I love the DevaCare which has just a mild minty fragrance.
"
"
I love it. it is a little weird washing my girls hair and not seeing any foam. But it does work and her hair is beautiful.
"
"
Good for a quick clean, but is not strong enough to remove chorine, hair spray, etc.
"
"
This shampoo (or no-poo) does work. It makes my hair frizz-free, and enhances the natural wave that I have. However, the smell is AWFUL! It actually reminds me of the smell of perm solution -- it's very strong and chemical-like (the conditioner smells only slightly better -- like the soap in the car wash). For me, the scent of a product is equally important as whether or not it can get the job done. If you can get past the smell, it is a good product. But, I will be shopping for another sulfate-free shampoo product.
"
"
Stinks
"
"
First thing I thought, ""Please don't let me like this stuff, please!!"" For one, is because it is so expensive for shampoo and I don't want to have to spend that much on it everytime I need it. But I ended up loving this stuff to death. No!!!!! First off, the DevaCurl line smells freaking AMAZING! I am in love with the smell, every product has a different type of smell, but along the same lines a similar smell. I swear I could spend 15 minutes just siting there and smells this amazing stuff.Second, as you most likely heard there is no lather in this, but when I use it I really feel like my hair is getting really clean. And I love rubbing this stuff all over my hair. I feel comepletely refreshed after. So here is my problem. I really like this stuff, but it's so expensive. But I think I'm going to keep on getting it anyway. It's good for my hair and I love it, so yeah~!
"
"
Excellent product for dryer hair. I have colored, blond, wavy hair and live in Southern California. This shampoo soothes the scalp, reduces frizz, smells fantastic yet natural and has no nasty parabens or sulfates. IT DOES NOT LATHER AS INTENDED. Shampoos lather as chemicals are added to do just that...they just fool you into results.
"
"
My hairstylist (who trained with DevaCurl) encouraged me to try this, thinking it'd help a decade-long struggle with dandruff because maybe it was a result of a reaction to sulfates.  I know it's best to avoid sulfates, but because they're missing, this doesn't lather, and I feel like it's hard to tell when I've gotten it thoroughly disbursed through my very curly hair.  I've used Trader Joe's sulfate-free shampoo, yet I think it still lathered a bit so it was easier to get through the hair.  Regardless, the No-Poo didn't help my dandruff at all, and I don't think it's made much of a difference in my hair in general.  Disappointing for how expensive it is.
"
"
Nice cleanser. I had to get pass the fact that there is no lather, but overall I will buy it again.
"
"
I have tried many products to manage my curly hair. Some have worked OK, but not great. I also wanted a product that allowed me to go a couple days without washing my hair, I usually have to wash my hair everyday to activate the curls, but I have very long, thick hair that I air dry, so it takes half day for it to be completely dry, washing my hair every day is a pain!  This product gave me the best hair I ever had! I washed my hair with the Devacurl no-poo and then applied Devacurl One Condition. I rinsed the conditioner very well and then, still in the shower, I squeezed the excess water and applied a little of the Curl Angel Gel. Then I used a cotton t-shirt to ""scrunch"" my hair, that got ride of excess water and set my curls. Then I just let the hair air dry and I was amazed by the results. Next day I woke up and my hair was still looking great! I don't have to wash my hair every day now!  The only thing that I am not too thrill about is the smell of the no-poo and conditioner, but the curl gel smells great and kind of mask the smell of the other products.
"
"
I bought this product with high hopes, but the smell of this shampoo is so strong, it was really overpowering!  It has a strong perfume-like smell that lingers on your head for hours.  I only used it once.  I am sorry I bought it.
"
"
I notice the shampoo has brought about more improvement as the weeks go by. The hair feels softer, stronger, and frizz is gone. Certainly does not strip or damage in any way.
"
"
It's not gluten free and irritated the heck out of my scalp...RETURNING:/
"
"
This is no better than VO5 Kiwi Lime Conditioner (a product I found out about from a beauty review website).  It's simple not worth the money.  Yes, it keeps color from fading (just like VO5) and yes, it smells nice (just like VO5) but it's expensive so why spend the money when something that's ten times less expensive works just as well or better.  Phooey!  I'll use up the bottle because I paid for it, but I won't be fooled into buying another one.  I purchased 3 Deva Curl products from my stylist who insisted that all three would work together to produce awesome results.  Well, Set It Free did not control the frizz (Got2be Shine Serum works like a charm) and the Arc Angel gel didn't hold my style (TIGI Catwalk Strong Mousse works great and isn't crunchy at all).  All in all, I'm sorry I wasted the money and all three bottles are gathering dust in my hall closet.  Maybe someone with curly hair will come into my life and I can pawn them off on her.  What a shame!  I don't have any idea why this line has so many good reviews.  It did absolutely nothing and I'm all the poorer for it.  I definitely don't recommend this product.
"
"
I was loyal to this brand for 10 years, but no more. After a year of trying to solve the mystery behind my thin and damaged hair strands, hair loss, and scalp irritation, I believe Deva is to blame.
"
"
I love what the Deva Curl line is doing for my hair. I have superfine, loosely curled, over shoulder length hair that can get really dry and frizzy.Have used Deva Curl for a few weeks now, and after only one week noted that my hair is much shinier, softer, and has beautiful waves. I personally like the smell of the No-Poo....the conditioner, I am not such a fan of though. The No Poo leaves my scalp and hair clean, even though using a cleanser that doesn't lather took some getting used to! I wholeheartedly recommend this product, but make sure you only use products that are compatible- I don't think the No Poo can remove silicone based products.

I have damaged ends and oily roots. I didn’t like this cleanser. My ends were still stripped and dry. Roots got oilier faster. Plus this cleanser smells like ammonia it isn’t very pleasant. This is probably better suited for dry scalps aka healthy curly heads. For damaged hair forget it.
"
"
My scalp used to get itchy and oily by the end of day two, but with this my scalp feels a lot better. I can wash every 2 or 3 days, rather than every 1 or 1 1/2 days like before.As for curls - I have half very wavy & half very straight hair. What I wash with doesn't make too much difference because it will be frizzy if I don't set it somehow (thank goodness for velcro rollers). But I do find that my hair seems healthy and soft when washed with this.Ultimately, my hair doesn't mind whether I use shampoo or no-poo, but my scalp prefers this stuff.
"
"
The no poo from Deva curl that I buy from DevaCurl doesn't have parabens.  Other ingredients listed on thus label are different as well.  I would be skeptical about this curly ladies and gents.
"
"
please don’t purchase. do your research. huge scandal and lawsuit going on right now. my apologies to all the victims of these horrible products.
"
"
I was very excited to try this product. Their hair gel has been amazing for my hair. However the no poo is no bueno. It did work to give me great curls, however it never made my hair feel clean. I was determined to be able to give this a fair review, so I used the entire bottle. My scalp got very itchy and there was usually still bits of product in it.
"
"
I'm really a low maintenance person, and have become more so, the more children I have, so this product is AWESOME for me!  My hair is curly in back and the middle, and wavy in front top and sides.  I got a great ""curly girl"" haircut to flatter my curls, and using the Deva Curl products feels like a must.  My curly hair looks so much better when I use it...plus I love the smell.  The water based product is a plus, as well as no sulfites in the ""no Poo""  If you have curly hair, try it, you might love it...and if you don't, sell it back to someone who does!
"
"
I tried out DevaCurl on the recommendation of a coworker. The ""No-Poo"" shampoo is hydrating yet cleansing. Unfortunately, it leaves behind a very STRONG perfume smell that, for me, lasted the whole day and would have gone on lasting if I hadn't given up and washed my hair with a different product. There are plenty of non-natural ingredients on the label, including the extremely offensive ""Parfum (Perfume)"" - so I should have known better. Nevertheless, all the hype DevaCurl spends on making their product sound like it's better for you than a sudsing shampoo seems sort of misplaced if they can't even take out the artificial scents.If you are sensitive to perfumes, dyes etc. these are not the products for you.
"
"
It doesn't work the curling magic of my hopes and dreams but it detangles well, defrizzes a decent amount, smells nice, and doesn't dry out my scalp like shampoo.
"
"
made my head itch like crazy.  didn't matter what i did.  wish i could get a refund

My three year old daughter has gorgeous ringlet curls.  Her hair is thick and getting long.  I've been terrified to do anything to her hair in fear that we will lose the curls.  Around the same age I had similar hair and my mom cut it off to achieve the Dorothy Hammel bob.  My hair forever lost the ringlets and most of the curl.To properly care for my daughter's hair I first ordered the book Curly Girl!  Fabulous book on caring for curly hair.  I learned I was washing my daughter's hair too often and brushing it when wet.  Big no no's!  The book also gave suggestions on how to cut the hair to maintain the curl's natural shape.  Next was having the proper products to keep the hair clean and detangled.The DevaCurl products are great.  They smell fresh and clean.  Since moving to them I have seen my daughter's hair look more vibrant and healthy.  In addition, I no longer need detangler.  I only ""wash"" her hair with the No Poo once a week. If it needs to be freshened up (after fun in the sandbox) I use a little bit of the conditioner when she is in the tub.  Otherwise, sometimes I simply spritz her hair with a water bottle filled with a few drops of essential oil such as lavendar or orange mixed with water.  I squeeze her curls after they are misted and they bounce back to shape.The products seem to be a little too heavy for my hair though I do use them about once a week for a deep conditioning.  My husband's hair is wavy and thick.  He really likes these products and has switched over to this brand.

"
Fake product! I’ve been using DevaCurl products for four years now, and this bottle of fake product nearly ruined my hair. The ingredients aren’t the same as a true DevaCurl Mist-er Right spray I purchased last week at my regular salon. For the last two months or so (since I’ve been using the Amazon purchased bottle) my hair has been so dry it feels like a hay bale. My curls were frizzy and flat, and since I’ve stopped using the fake product my hair has gone back to normal with some extra TLC.
"
"
I just received DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher last week. I have always loved DevaCurl products and was excited to try this. But, it simply smells putrid. I feel like some animal has climbed up into my hair and died.... and then rotted. I read the reviews, before purchase, and saw they were mixed. But, the folks who liked it seemed to really like it. So, I gave it a shot - twice. My hair does feel a little softer. But, it is not worth the odor. I plan to return it. I gave it one star because zero was not an option AND my hair does feel a little better.
"
"
This is my second bottle and it doesn't smell as good as the first one, which was lavender scented. This smells like chemical hair product. And it doesn't do as good a job of refreshing my limp curls as the original. The formula change was not a good one.
"
"
This has been the best product for second day curls/waves. My hair is naturally wavy and I've been wearing it straight all my life and am only just now learning how to coax my pretty waves back to life and health. I've even used this to revive my hair on the third day too.  I just spritz all over l, then I flip my head over to spray underneath, flip head back to normal position, scrunch my hair all over to encourage curls and let it air dry! So simple.
"
"
This smells bad like fish oil. It’s a light smell but obviously I don’t want to smell like that. I have never used this product before so I’m not sure if it’s fake or maybe just really old. I doubt the product is suppose to smell like fish oil though.
"
"
When you have curly hair, no amount of product put in while wet keeps it looking as fresh the next day. I use to over load my hair with a plethora of products which only weighed it down or made it hard, but this stuff is amazing. You won’t be disappointed in this product!
"
"
My curly hair has never looked better than when I started using DevaCurl products.  DevaCurl Mist-er Curl Refresher really refreshes your hair's curl on the 2nd, 3rd & even 4th day. No more bed head and loss of curls after a nights sleep.  Of all the hair products for curls I've used this is the brand that delivers.
"
"
This isn't a diss to the seller, this is about the product itself. It came on time and undamaged from the seller, no leaks or anything which is most appreciated.  As for the product itself, it was a bit expensive  (same price in stores) but I think , instead of actually refreshing my curls, it made them almost crispy where scrunching the crunch did not help. It also made my scalp itch terribly, even when I tried not to get any of it on my scalp. The build up felt bad. By the end of the day, my curls looked limped and greasy, even using a little. I like the smell though, but devacurl could have created something better and less heavy. Mist-er Right is not right for me.

I have thick, curly, coarse hair. This product did not refresh my curls when I applied it to my dry hair. It seemed to provide some defining qualities if I used it right after washing and applying smoothing product. I would not purchase this again.

"
"
I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because this is a little bit expensive I feel for hair product, but after using it I was amazed. Not used to  something without wetting my hair first or combing it in, but I went right by the directions and was surprised how it revived my frizzed out curly lifeless hair. Today was my second day using it and I am glad I found and purchased this.  It also leaves my hair tangle free which is always an issue.
"
"
I use this spray on my first-day curls that have a bit of frizz but mostly on my second-day curls that need revitalizing. I also use it on my 5 year old's hair to bring back the bounce of her curls in between washes. The scent is quite pleasing and there's no sticky-ness or crunch to the curls.
"
"
I really like how the product does revitalize my waves nicely. However, I cannot get past the strong scent! Smells almost medicinal which is very disappointing! I find it interesting per all the reviews people really Love the scent, or can't stand it! lol... I may not be able to get past the scent but love what it does for my curls! I give a definite thumbs up!
"
"
I really wish I hadn't believed the reviews, many of which I'm guessing aren't real. I've tried a million sprays like this and this one is exactly the same - creates kind of a stiff film on top but does not add curl, refresh, minimize frizz or make my hair/scalp feel cleaner in any way. I'm still on the hunt. So far, nothing works better than plain water.
"
"
This does help my curls if they're getting flat after a few days, but it leaves your hair kind of sticky so beware. The smell is pretty strong lavender. I would use this on the last day before washing.
"
"
I have a daughter, and I have had to buy many hair products and accessories!  This one works great!  I re purchase it usually monthly ! I would highly recommend this product to my friends and family!
"
"
I just received and haven't used yet, so can't vouch for how well it works, but wow, it smells awful. Like a chemical cleaning product. I ignored previous commenters complaints about smell and thought I'd give it a try, but phew, I don't think I'm going to use this.
"
"
I have been using Mist-er Right forever. This last bottle I received the spray is thicker and sticky and keeps clogging the spray nozzle. It also smells different (not as good).  Not a fan. I have been slowing replacing all my Deva products lately as  they all seem to have changed for the worse.
"
"
When I received this product the packaging was soaking wet & the bottle was half full. I thought this product would follow its description, & refresh my curls yet it did the opposite. It made my hair extremely frizzy & smells like chemicals & lavender. Really disappointed in this product.
"
"
I really like the DevaCurl products. I have natural curly hair. These products work well for me. I will NEVER order them through Amazon again. They came in ripped packaging. Missing products. Leaking products. It is a mess. Amazon Customer Service used to be the best. No longer. DevaCurl should reconsider making their products available through Amazon. Bad experience will keep away customers.
"
"
This product didn't meet my expectations at all. I tried it a few times. I could get over the potent sent if my hair looked great/felt great. The deal breaker is the texture. My thin curly hair felt as though it had been fried when I used this product. This product also caused a ton of frizz. Keep looking for another product.
"
"
I love this product, it is the best solution to freshen up your hair on the non-wash days without weighing it down with a lot of product.  Also great for adding a bit of moisture to combat frizz throughout the day.  This is my new secret weapon to keeping my hair looking great.
"
"
Refreshes curly hair so beautifully! No need to re-wash and style every few days! Just spray and re-scrunch!!
"
"
This product is fake! It smells awful and makes your hair hard. Please do not buy this.
"
"
Not very reliable. Doesn't work well for bouncing back curls. smells more like harsh chemicals not pleasant scent.
"
"
Works good hate the smell!!! I have a family member who is an alcoholic and this smells the way that person smells after a binge night- gross!  Honest I can’t stomach the smell, works so good but I can’t use it
"
"
This is my ultimate favorite curl refresher. I have been using it for years!  It has a great smell so it’s always wonderful on the day you don’t wash your curls. It’s not heavy so it doesn’t weigh them down. I even use them if I diffuse a curl and it gets frizzy
"
"
It’s just ok. You have to use a TON in order to get the revitalized curls your working for. If you have wavy hair, this product will be great. Super long curls, not so good. If rather wet my hair than use half the bottle trying to get my curls right.
"
"
My hair can't go a non wash day without this!  My curls go from flat to bouncy in a few sprays.  I have bought so many bottles it's crazy.  Loyal to this one!
"
"
Love Love this stuff!! Even after my curly hair is straightened from wearing a bun, I just spray this on and my curls come bavk like magic!!
"
"
Excellent for reviving second and third day curls. Smell us not my favorite, but that's a personal preference. DevaCurl products live up to the hype!
"
"
This product is really good, it helps to reshape my curls on day 2. The only downside is that it does make your hair feel a little dry, and doesn’t really help with frizz but helps give my curls a refresh.
"
"
This stuff really works!
"
"
This gets my hair together when I don't like how my hair looks after I have dried it.  This product works miracles!  I don't know what I'd do without it!
"
"
Love the Deva products i love this refresher it smells amazing and to know it has all the vitamins and essentials my hair needs majes me feel even better
"
"
This stuff makes my hair instantly frizzy. Does not “refresh” my curls it ruins them. It’s like a spraying water on my hair. Tried it several times, always the same. :(
"
"
One of my all time favorite curly hair products. Great in between washings and a way to reactivate your curl.  I usually dampen my hair first with water, apply product and scrunch. Gives definition and a little structure.
"
"
This product isn't whay it's cracked up to be. It's water, lavender and minimal non frizz stuff for curls. I find that my own water bottle spritzer with lavender and a little frizz oil,  does the same if not better to refresh my curls.
"
"
This is to be used on dry hair and it does a great job.  Works best on hair that has been washed a day or two before use.  I find it isn't as effective on hair which has product buildup.
"
"
This spray definitely brings life and bounce back to my hair in the mornings. My only complaint is that it seems to add frizz and my hair feels a bit dry after I use it. I pair it with a leave in conditioner and that helps a lot.
"
"
I love this stuff it makes my dry hair turn curly with a few sprays.
"
"
This product doesn't refresh my curls. It leaves my hair sticky when you apply it and then rough. I get better results when I spray my hair with water as opposed to using this product. It doesn't work and definitely not worth the money.
"
"
I purchased this for my curly extension (human hair) at the recommendation of a coworker and stylist.  My hair was still frizzy and the product smells funny.  Perhaps it's better for short, curly hair, but it did nothing for my long curls.  I did better with a $5 bottle of mousse from Walgreens.  I would not purchase again.
"
"
Doesn't moisturize my hair, smells funny. I don't really use it. Waste of money.
"
"
wonderful product to refresh your curls.
"
"
She is buying other products she loved so much
"
"
This is the product I've been looking for my whole life!!! I love my curls but they don't look great after being slept on. Using mister right brings them right back to life!
"
"
I've used this product for about 2 years now. Great product! Brings next day curls back to life!
"
"
Good product. I am not happy with the way it smells. Lavander is to strong, but it really helps my hair to feel fresh. It takes too much product to get it to work.
"
"
Did not like it. Did not like the smell.  Didn't do anything for my hair.  Disappointed
"
"
Works pretty well to revive last night's curls..however if you woke up frizzy, you'll still have frizzy curls after using this. I also don't care for the smell at all.
"
"
You can spray dry or wet and your curls come to life
"
"
Love the stuff
"
"
Let me start by saying that I am not naturally curly. I love curls tho, and have a perm. Every single Deva Curl product does just what it promises. Have to say that  Mister Right is probably my favorite and one I use every day. Keeps my curls lively and curly, not frizzy or lank.
"
"
LOVE devacurl products - nothing negative to say. I use this on my daughters very curly hair as a curl refresher when she has a ponytail puff.
"
"
I have mildly curly hair and live by DEVA products.
"
"
I am new to devacurl I love all the products I had tried up to this point. I did not like this product. I did like the transaction with the seller though
"
"
I love this product ! But upon opening the package one of the bottles was wet . The bottle was completely closed but the outside was wet and the box also had product spilled on the bottom.
"
"
Works good along with water mister to refresh my curls.
"
"
I really like this product as a little pick me up to my curls and just to freshen up after a workout.
"
"
All of my DevaCurl products are excellent - the finest I have ever used on my hair!
"
"
Easy and go
"
"
I used it to refresh after yoga and my curls bounced back beautifully! The smell might be a turn off for some but I loved it so much.
"
"
My favorite product for day 2 curls. It freshens the curl without making it stiff. It smells great, too.
"
"
This product doesn’t work well on its own. You need to use other products and water as well.
"
"
I received damage and having  to waste my time on returning the empty bottle which the bag was wet from spilling in the bag, and it stupid for you all ask me take a picture of the item and I don't have access to do, very disappointed
"
"
The smell is super strong and I’m not a fan. I love DevaCurl products, but this is one I am never going to buy again.
"
"
We love this product! Bought it for myself but my 17 year old daughter has stolen it. It is now her favorite go to
"
"
Works as expected. Smells great
"
"
I put on the Deva coconut curl cream first after shampooing then during the day on next day use to freshen up curls with Mister right
"
"
Love this
"
"
Great for an afternoon curl refresh! Love it!
"
"
Perfect to refresh my curl shape without having to re wet my whole head. Great for on the go or after being at the beach all day.
"
"
I have semi curly/frizzy in the summer hair. This product made it into a matted mess. I had to scrub my hair and load it down with heavy duty conditioner just so I could get a comb though it. Really disappointing. I gave the bottle to a friend who uses it.
"
"
Works well
"
"
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!!
"
"
Did not like it.. AT ALL.... Leaves my hair super dry!!! Just not what I expected at all!
"
"
thank you excellent!
"
"
C-
"

Best products for my curls and keeps them bouncy for days.
"

I use DevaCurl AnGel after washing my hair and let it air dry, then Mist-er Right to refresh each day till the next wash. There's nothing better! My hair is naturally curly, but gets very wavy after sleeping on it. A spray of Mist-er Right with scrunching and the curls are back perfectly when it dries. It feels a little sticky on my hands when damp, but that disappears when it dries and my hair is soft and touchable.My hair is thick, not coarse, there's just a lot of it, but I know others with thin curly hair who also love this product. A water spray will not bring the curl back to my hair like the Mist-er Right. Water just accentuates the waves. The strong lavender odor disipates as the product dries leaving my hair with a nice clean smell that doesn't fight with my perfume.DevaCurl AnGell Conditioning Gel - 32 OzDeva Curl Mist, Er Right, 12 oz
"
"
Makes curls refreshed but leaves a crunchy residue
"
"
Love love love Deva curl..
"
"
I use Mist-Er Right in combination with Deva Fresh. It helps me keep my curls throughout the week.
"
"
I can't tell a difference when I use this product. Waste of money.
"
"
This truly refreshes my curls, makes my hair smell great and does its job. The issue I have with it is the residue I feel like it leaves on my hair. The no poo method it’s meant to accompany doesn’t seem to take it off. I think I’m gonna have to use regular shampoo.
"
"
This stuff works great on curly hair
"
"
It really didn’t do anything that water doesn’t do. It didn’t add shine or make my daughters hair soft or refresh her curls. Water and some tea tree oil work better and the smell isn’t that great.
"
"
Extremely drying!!
"
"
Buen producto
"
"
Really like!! Good for touching up curls!!
"

The best curl refresher spray for my crazy curls.

Refreshed my curls

DevaCurl Mister Right - Awesome Product for 2-3 day curl refresher
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Great curl refreshing spray for next day hair. Doesn’t leave hair stiff or sticky. Lavender scent
"
"
It seemed to work okay but the fragrance of it was way to strong and gave me a headache.
"
"
Works well with conditioner not as a stand-alone product.  But it does take away frizzy!!
"
"
I dno if it is me who didn’t know how to use it on my 3 a/b dyed hair. But my hair become worst when I use it
"
"
Makes my frizzies go away.Rejuvenates the curls.
"
"
Great for scrunching with out weighing down curls
"
"
Not so great. Only used twice and gives my hair a grimy look. Not sure if I am using it right.
"
"
It dries out my hair but at the same time it does revitalize the curl.
"
"
Great boost to add curls for an in-between wash.
"
"
Does everything that it claims it can do. Great results!
"
"
Top of product was sticking out of box 2 inches.  Product was not sealed and leaking.. I am wondering if this is a ""fake"".
"
"
I absolutely love this product! I love the smell of it, I love that it is light and never leaves my hair gunky or stiff. My hair is always soft and movable. I spritz my hair in the morning and scrunch it, it dries quickly and looks amazing!
"
"
Strong lavender scent
"
"
Yuck.  Makes my hair SO dry & sticky & actually reduces the amount of curl I have. :/
"
"
Did not work for me
"
"
Have used this product for years! Works beautifully!
"
"
Just received my spray open to smell it and it smells disgusting like a chemical this is the second seller to sell a fake product!!!!
"
"
Love! Love! Love Deva Curl! Amazing products.
"
"
Curly people understand. Makes a great next day hair day.
"
"
It made my hair a sticky mess!! It may be good for some hair types but not naturally curly frizzy hair! Very disappointed but love the arc angel gel!
"
"
I’m not sure if this is a real Devacurl product; but it doesn’t do what it says. You are supposed to apply it to your hair dry to refresh it but it doesn’t do much.
"
"
Great product!  Great price!
"
"
This is just liquid gel I thought it waxed something different I wouldn't pay this much for gel and it stinks
"
"
Smells great. Doesn’t leave a filmy feeling on my hair.
"
"
the quality is great
"
"
Good product
"
"
This stuff is amazing! My curls feel soft and added bonus it’s smells great. It helps maintain my curls without frizz
"
"
The smell isn’t pleasant and it dried my hair, making my curls MORE frizzy. Would not purchase again.
"
"
I like it because it supports my curls
"
"
A must have for curly hair.. a staple of my Deva Curl products. Smells great and revitalizes the curl next day
"
"
awful stuff - very globby and make hair frizzy
"
"
Received the order late, and when it arrived there was a crack in the lid and product was leaking all over.  Returning.
"
"
Refreshed my curls. Don’t like the smell on my hair.
"
"
Good product
"
"
Goood
"
"
Love Love Love this product!! Completely revives my curls!
"
"
Bottle was leaking when arrived.
"
"
Restores your curls the next day. Read a lot of negative reviews this worked great for my waveyCurls.
"
"
Great product, second time I buy it.
"
"
The product fluid was not filled up to the top. Seems like a rip off!!
"
"
This i a great refresher.I love it .
"
"
It refreshes my curls - love it.
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
Exactly as described
"
"
Wake up and spritz, scrunch, and go.
"
"
Love the way it revitalizes my hair and smells great
"
"
Worked ok
"

I received it without a lid. So some of it leaked out.
"
"
fast shipping product as described
"
"
Speedy delivery, and arrived exactly as described!!
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Great product! I was a little skeptical that this would make any difference, but it perks my curls up nicely on days I don't wash my hair. It is light and smells great. Not sticky, not too strong.
"
"
product had leaked through the box and the box was semi crumbled in the corner.

Before this I would use shea moisture shampoo, conditioner and curl cream and wash every 2-3 days and it stayed soft and somewhat manageable. By day 3 it starts to get frizzy and a little out of control.Just used this on my hair *dry* as instructed on day 3 because I needed something to zap some moisture back in to lengthen time between washes.It completely dried out my hair and made it much much MUCH more frizzier. I have a mix of 3b,c and kinky 4a hair. I'm worried it's damaged now.I followed instructions and am disappointed because this is my first devacurl product I've used.
"
"
I am always hesitant with this brand because I feel like I either hate it or love it. This one, I can’t live without!! I don’t wash my curls everyday, this spray wakes them up in the mornings! It’s absolutely amazing!  Works best if you spray a tiny smidge of water on your dry hair before using and less is more!
"
"
This stuff is like crack for curls! However the scent is not pleasant at all. That’s the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star.
"
"
Since I started using it, my hair has gotten dryer and frizzier.  I bought it hoping it will refresh my curls the next day, but it doesn't.  You have to add a lot of product to get your curls back and it smells very strong.
"
"
This didn't do a lot to help my hair on second or third day.  It left it feeling dry and it didn't re-curl as much as i would like. I also am not a fan of the strong lavender smell.  :(
"
"
It definitely refreshes my curls the next day and I love, so far, how it makes my hair look. Smells terrible . Unsure of where the lavender is .. all the other Devacurl products smell amazing . Bought a large bottle and will just deal with the smell because I like what it does for my hair 🤷🏼‍♀️
"
"
I do like this.  Most of all when I just want to freshen up my hair.  The product line improves texture, natural curl or waves.
"
"
Good product
"

This is an updated review:I've ordered this before, and I don't remember it smelling foul. But when this arrived, I compared the smell against a bottle I had bought from a store. Lo and behold, this one is fake. It reeks of chemicals, with a top off of faint lavender.The bottles even look a little different- see my pic. The one on the left is from this seller, and the pink is slightly darker than the one on the right (which I bought from a store). So whomever is counterfeiting this product is pretty close with the label, but not exact. It's very deceptive. I don't even know what's really in that bottle.Bottom line: for your hair's sake, spend the extra 10 bucks, and buy it from a reputable store. It's not worth risking your hair's health, much less the smell.UPDATE: I reported this item, from the seller of my purchase, and they have deactivated the listing by that particular seller. Hopefully that will help as somewhat of a deterrent.

I have LOTS of 2B hair and it is a pain to wash, especially when exhausted from workdays. It is also color treated. This is a great way to get the bounce back before going out at night or after sleeping on it before starting my day. It can add some frizz, so I typically follow up by scrunching some oil through. I have been told several times people like my perfume, but it is really just this stuff; kind of an essential oil (lavender maybe?) type smell
"
"
This product works great to refresh my curls between washings. I spritz some all over and scrunch it into my hair, then scrunch my hair into a pile on my head and secure it in a large jaw clip while I get ready in the morning. When I take it down, my curls are defined again, and any frizz I get between washings is greatly reduced. It also smells great!
"
"
I love the DevaCurl line and this has to be their most underwhelming product. It does somewhat refresh your curls but it makes them stiff and fuses tangles into your hair. There is no way to run your fingers through to detangle and even my detangling brush had trouble getting them out at the end of the day. It's basically just hairspray with a fancy name, I would not buy again.
"
"
Turned my hair into a frizzy mess, I tossed it after trying it for a week. I've tried the gel, spray, and cream all of them made me look like Einstein.
"
"
I was looking for something to help with second day+ hair. I love my DevaCurl gel, so thought I would give Mist-er Right a try. Not helpful at all. It makes my hair look greasy and flat without doing anything for the frizz. I get better results by spritzing my hair with water and crunching in some conditioner, so I will stick with that.
"
"
I don't love this but I don't think it's terrible. I followed the directions and my curls were a little more defined than they had been but also very messy, and my hair felt really grimy until I showered, which is a feeling I really don't like.
"
"
Oh my gosh, the scent. I have never brought this product before trying it on here so I don’t know if this is how it should really smell. It smells like bug spray. After spraying it on my hair, I had to spray on perfume into my hair to mask the odor. Whoa.
"
"
Didn't work for my 3c hair. I used quite a bit and it didn't really get my curls back into shape after sleeping on them. Had to wet with water as usual.
"
"
Exactly the product described! Great for curly hair. I recommend it. I usually use it the day after I shower once my hair is all dry, and now has messed up curls from sleeping, I spray it all over my hair and bam my curls are refreshed! Also I get many compliments on my hair smelling great with this!
"
"
I have fine hair but it’s also curly. Usually the day after washing my hair, my curls are drab and lifeless. I’ve used this twice on day 2 after washing my hair and am shocked at how well this works! My curls look as good as the day I washed them!  Big fan of this product!
"
"
This just arrived. And holy crap it smells like pickles.  Pretty sure this is a fake. It stinks so bad it smells like I rinsed my hair with pickle juiceUpdate: I gave this a try even tho it smelled so bad. Made my normally slightly frizzy hair a mess. It feels super dry, and brittle now.  Horrible product
"
"
Didn't work for me.  I prefer Curl Maker.Smelled great, though!
"
"
This product is junk. I thought it was comparable to a dry shampoo, but it's the opposite. It makes my hair feel gross and doesn't help ""refresh"" my curls any more than water.
"
"
My hair changed to curly in the last year and I was told about this product- it's a PERFECT refresher! I keep it at my office to freshen up if I'm going out after work!
"
"
I think I received a used product despite the sticker on it that said it was new.  The bottle was not filled all the way, the sprayer was broken, and there was no product seal.  Really????
"
"
This product doesn’t refresh anything. It makes my hair even more frizzy than if sat in a sauna for 5 minutes.
"
"
Love the brand but this product made my hair feel sticky and frizzy. Very disappointed. You’re better off using a mist bottle with water and lavender.
"
"
This stuff is great for refreshing, but if you’ve got fine type 2 or 3A wave/curls, use sparingly as it will leave a film on your hair.
"
"
I am not sure that I like this product as much as I love the conditioner.  The other products make our hair so so soft!
"
"
This is the best stuff I’ve found for my hair when I want to reshape my curls after sleeping or otherwise messing them up. I hate the smell, lavender I believe, but it works so well I look past it.
"
"
Scent is strong! Works well. My kids use it and seem to like it okay. Refresh and recurl. Nice product
"
"
This product is very good for curly hair when it’s gotten a bit frizzy and you need to just refresh your hair and bring back the curl. It’s also good for when you wake up and want to just refresh the curls.
"
"
This stuff is awesome. I have 3b curls, and whenever they get a little limp or lackluster, I just spray in some Mist-er Right, give my curls a little fluff, and they look good as new!
"
"
The scent is WAY too strong and it's sticky. I will not reorder. Worked ok but no thanks.
"
"
Save your money,  this is basically water, a tiny bit of conditioner and lavender scent.
"
"
I don’t really care for these products they don’t work like I expected them to.
"
"
My hair dresser tried this on my hair and it is great holds my curl and adds body
"
"
Anything Devacurl is awesome and Amazon pricing can’t be beat!
"
"
It’s kind of sticky and I’m not a fan of the smell. A spray bottle with water and conditioner mixed in works better.
"
"
I NEEDED this okay. I think I have 3bhair and by day 3 my wash and go is pretty lackluster. I used this on day 5 and it took be back to day 3! Lol
"
"
really helps to revitalize curls
"
"
Nice smell
"
"
I usually love Devacurl products but this item smells awful.
"
"
I really like! I use it everyday. to make it work i first sprey my hair with a little water . then, add this. (about five sprays). then i add some gel! PRESTO!
"
"
Good for the hair, but i dont like the smell so much.
"
"
Afree Curlkeeper and some gel for definition, once dry I mist with this to decrunch, and walah, best routine yet for my hard to manage curls.
"
"
This works awesome! Spray it after you’ve slept on your curls and it brings them back to life!!  I love the lavender smell, too!
"
"
Excellent product n price ...
"
"
A little sticky for my liking.
"
"
This will make your curls a bit hard... Like hair spray. Not what I was looking for. And if you don't like lavender ... This product isn't for you.
"
"
Rejuvenator is exactly what it is.  Allows me to go an extra day without washing my dry curly hair--I am hooked.
"
"
This worked great to refresh my natural curly hair, and it smells great too!  I use this on my sons hair as well.
"
"
Great stuff use between washings to refresh your style.
"
"
doesn’t refresh anything.
"
"
I love this stuff. Makes my hair look good for days
"
"
Works well if you can get over the smell
"
"
I received this and the product had leaked all over.
"
"
Using this product for a few years. Works well.
"
"
I'm sure this works for someone, just not for my fine 2b/3a hair, just looked flat frizzy and if anything more greasy.
"
"
Only hair product my mother will use on her hair. Sulfate free free works wonderful to keep her perm up.
"
"
Made my hair soooo dry, loss my curls retention. Frizzy. Do not buy this product. It destroyed my natural curls.
"
"
Ugh! Funky smell. Did not work as described.
"
"
Does not work like i thought it would. I will not order again
"
"
Works for me!
"
"
Love this stuff on my curls
"
"
It makes my hair feel a bit crunchy on day 2, and it's not a crunchy that can be scrunched out.
"
"
Never ever had I been able to do 2nd days curls until I met Mister Right by DevaCurl!
"
"
I really do like this product
"
"
Great product
"
"
This spray helps rejuvenate curls throughout the day.  It did not give me second day curls.  It does help with refreshing for an evening out.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Great product
"
"
Loved this at the salon when my stylist used it...not so sure now that it's in my own bathroom. It can/does right the curl if used well...but adds a dirty feel to the locks that I don't really enjoy.
"
"
For those days you wake up like a lion
"
"
Works great to enhance my curls!
"
"
Perfect for next day hair, absolutely love it!
"
"
Let me start by saying I LOVE DevaCurl. The No-poo shampoo has a slight odor to it that is unpleasant but not unbearable being able to cover it with the conditioner and styling products.This spray STINKS and seeing as how it is meant to be a final touch up spray there is nothing to mask the smell. I used it once before returning. I wanted to see if the product was still worth using. My hair was still frizzy and it did not work like I was hoping on second day curls.I decided to dilute the styling cream in water and turn that into a touch up spay, additional moisturiser added with the water to help relax the mess works perfectly and does not have the horrible stench that is spray does.
"
"
Terrible product. Does not work, waste of money.
"
"
I like deva curl products, but I can not get Mister Right to work for my hair. It could just be that it's my hair that is the problem. I have extremely fine hair, so when I use this, it makes my hair super stringy and sticky. If I use it, I always regret it and can't wait to go home and wash my hair. I'm still trying to find the right curl refresher for my hair type.
"
"
I am very surprised with this shampoo! It delivers such incredible slip while using, I felt as though I could detangle my hair in the shower using only this alone...and I have damaged ends!!! Waves and curls were popping and clumping. Due to the clumping action, I hated to use my comb but I have too until my ends are cut off. Not only that it does not have an overpowering scent, and it cleans my hair well (wash & repeat).I was using Wen before but start to get a little bit nervous with the hair loss claims. I thought it would help my damaged ends. I like that my hair color lasts with Wen and saw a little stripping of color after shampooing with Delight. However, I did not use a conditioner from this line, I used Trader Joe's which is not marketed for color-treated hair, and Delight is not marketed for color-treated hair, so I kept my star rating at 5.Delight shampoo is formulated perfectly for wavy/curly hair. Scalp is clean. Hair has a light airy feel. From the moment you use it in the shower...you'll know.
"
"
everytime I purchase it, the cap is not secured and some liquid has seeped out. I return it when it is a significant amount but guaranteed every single time there is a considerable amount of fluid leaked. This stuff aint cheap and how hard is it to figure something out to stop this?
"
"
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SUPPLIER!! I use this product and love it but went with a less expensive route than buying directly from Devacurl this time and this is AWFUL! It's watered down and not the same consistency as my bottle from the Devacurl website. My hair is not reacting the same way it does with products from Devacurl's website. Do not buy this. Waste of time and money.
"
"
I used to LOVE Deva Curl. Until one day I re-ordered my 'regular' batch Low Poo Delight & Ultra Defining Gel and noticed that it wasn't the same. I didn't think much about it (although I did mention the consistency difference to my hubby;). In the meantime I was loosing a crazy amount of hair, my scalp was a bit itchy and I noticed a few white flakes. Each shower I would cringe at the hair loss. I thought is was pre-menopausal, I had my thyroid, etc. checked out,  NEVER attributing the hair loss to the ah-mazing product I had used religiously for SO MANY YEARS! I continued using it (until last week 2/20) when I heard about everyone else's stories that were surprisingly similar to mine.

"
I'm new to using sulfate-free shampoo and decided to buy this as it seems DevaCurl is the most popular and trusted brand. I've been using this shampoo for a month now and since then my scalp has become dry and I have gotten a dandruff problem which I had never had a problem with before in my entire life! I have resorted to a baking soda treatment which has helped with the dandruff. I have wavy thin hair and the only products I use are this shampoo and conditioner. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to use the shampoo and conditioner with other products as well or if this shampoo just sucks and is overhyped. Other than that, this low-poo has almost no lather. After a wash, my hair feels dry and heavy but once it's completely air dried, my hair feels better
"
"
I have fine, wavy hair that tends to be dry.  This shampoo works great on my hair, cleanses well without drying and leaves it feeling like I don't even need a conditioner (but I do use one, the matching delight one condition).  I prefer the smell of the devacurl low poo but the smell of this shampoo isn't bad, just different.  All in all, I like this and will be buying the bigger bottle next time.
"
"
 My hair is naturally curly and with thin hair structure.I was very curios to try this brand and this is my first time testing Devacurl.I only bought the shapoo, no conditioner.pros-fast shipping-good product wrapping- great value for money ar this quantity- the product is a very thin liquid shapoo wich left my scalp feel ""chemical"" free-my hair is a bit curlier than usual after using this shapoo-it smells like flowers and nice fresh scent, probably from the rice water ingredientno cons, maybe i would have expected a conditioner sample, but i had no samples in the package
"
"
If I was rating on the condition of the product I would give only 1 star.  The product itself is very good.  But it arrived with the top open and a lot of the shampoo had leaked out into the bag and all over the container.
"
"
There's really nothing special about this shampoo, except the brand. I've had much better success with Shea Moisture products at half the cost. Also, I have kinky 3A hair and have had a Deva Cut, it did not match up to the hype. I actually got a better curly hair cut from a student who had no idea what deva was.
"
"
I have beach wavy hair and washing with regular shampoos make my hair fluffy and dry.. I use this more than I use regular shampoo. Now I can go almost 4 days a week without really washing my hair with. Regular aggressive shampoo!

I love this Low-Poo. It leaves my hair clean and moisturized. However on this order on arrival the bottle had leaked in the bag. I wish I could just get a discount on the price for the loss of product credited to my credit card instead of returning the entire product. That is not one of the options provided.
"
"
I love devacurl a lot and this stuff is authentic stuff but poorly packaged and leaked everywhere. I should have listened to the others when they had the same problem! Disappointing as this stuff isn’t cheap.
"
"
FABULOUS PRODUCT.  I have very frizzy, wavy and thick hair.  This stuff, when used with the conditioner and leave in, DOES MAGIC to my hair.  Normally i would layer on the product to get the NON FRIZZ look.  With these products, it looks so natural!! LOVE IT.
"
"
This shampoo is ok. The smell is odd. It's not offensive but it doesn't smell great either. It doesn't do much for my curly hair that I've noticed but it definitely doesn't dry it out, and it was a good value for the price.
"
"
Devacurl products truly helped my curls but my scalp hated them. I developed a very itchy scalp. Had to return.
"
"
Love the product, however the bottle leaked. So maybe issues with shipping.
"
"
I was so excited to get my favorite shampoo at such a great cost, but so upset that it came with the pump not working and shampoo leaking into the box.This packaged all wrong!
"
"
I was not happy to find the bottle had opened during transit and it was prettyMessy when I opened the box. Plus I lost a good amount of product, and this is not cheap! Other than that I love the product for my daughters curly hair.
"
"
The product makes my hair feel great, but the scent is terrible.  It has an artificial sweet smell that makes literally makes me nauseous.  It's too bad, I really wanted to like the product.
"
"
Love Deva Curl. Works beautifully to remove hairspray buildup and clean hair without drying. Use with One Condition and have happy healthy hair.
"
"
I like this better than the original No-Poo cleanser. This is less thick and I think cleans my hair better.
"
"
This is definitely not an original product.  I can tell by the smell and consistency.
"
"
Oh my gosh do I love this shampoo! I have naturally curly hair and it is hard to find good product to help maintain and bring out my curl...until I found Deva Curl!!!! This stuff is amazing!
"
"
Overall the BEST product on the market for curly or wavy hair. I ordered the larger bottle (32oz) and it came exactly as described with a pump included. The price is fair for the amount you receive. This would be much more expensive in beauty supply stores such as Ulta.
"
"
This is a great shampoo for curly hair.
"
"
Love this product. It makes my scalp feel clean, while not being too drying. Just what I was looking for.
"
"
Cleans well without being harsh on your hair.
"
"
love
"
"
amazing! I have super wavy hair when I was young, but it straightened out. turns out it was because I wasn't treating it properly. I switched to this shampoo and a new conditioner and my hair feels and looks great! the waves are finally back
"
"
My new hairdresser recommended Deva Curl. I bought a sample size. Was so happy with the way my thick wavy hair looked and felt. Bought the larger size shampoo and conditioner. Loving my hair.
"
"
I didn't look closely and thought this was the shampoo and conditioner set. It is TWO shampoos. If I wanted two shampoos I would just order one big bottle!
"
"
This stuff is making my hair fall out and my curls are going away!
"
"
Works well, price too high
"
"
i got my bottle today in the mail and about 1/5 of it leaked inside the bag it was packed in.first time i have had issues with this type of thing when getting liquid products shipped
"
"
I like the shampoo, but this bottle must have been old.  The shampoo was very think, not runny at all.  Very hard to lather and would stick to one spot on my head.  I bought a brand new bottle from Ulta after returning to this seller & have had great results.
"
"
The product itself is wonderful. The product though arrived damaged and leaking. I had to return it.
"
"
Great product - HOWEVER, it came packaged VERY poorly and the bottle was broken with leakage in the wrapping.  I was able to recover about 2/3rds of the product volume; the remainder was wasted.
"
"
I have very dry very fine somewhat curly frizzy hair. This is the best shampoo for my hair; gentle , cleansing but not drying, moisturizing but not too heavy.
"
"
Legit diva curl product
"
"
Great for wavy hair - fast easy transaction!!
"
"
This makes my scalp itchy and I don’t like the fragrance.
"
"
I like
"
"
I received this product only 2/3 full. I checked and there was no evidence of leaking in the box. This is far below the standard I expect for Amazon products.
"
"
The product was open and leaked all over the wrap and the box. It looks bad and there is no way I will repack it to return.
"
"
For some reason this makes my hair smell like bug spray and the consistency is like really thick mucus. My hair looks clean but is still only to the touch and is completely in need of a wash by the next morning. So disappointed in this product.
"
"
My bottle of shampoo came half empty. Whomever packed it didnt tighten the lid and it was a huge mess.
"
"
I have thin, fine wavy hair.  It has body and looks fuller than it is.
"
"
Bottle damaged with leak
"
"
Like the shampoo. But upon arrival it had burst open and all the contents had burts over other items. I would like a replacement please
"
"
Great product, my curly cleanser go-to! Works just as expected. Quality, genuine product for a great price.
"
"
Great for the curly head gal. Been using for years. No more hair in the shower drain either.
"
"
I loved this for my curls
"
"
I feel like this dried out my hair more, and the no poo is too heavy for my waves
"
"
This item was delivered damaged. It leaked all over the box. I’m very disappointed.
"
"
I thought it wasn't going to work because I saw that some people got knock offs but mine was great.
"
"
I love the product and shipping was quick.
"
"
The best shampoo for curly hair
"
"
Not as good as the no poo
"
"
Item leaked all over during shipping.  I returned it and reordered and it leaked again.  I love the shampoo and plan to order again. Hopefully the cap will be taped or at least screwed on tight.
"
"
Nothing better!!
"
"
The best shampoo/conditioner I have ever had for naturally curly hair. No frizz
"
"
it smells like dishsoap.the original line is waaaaay better.
"
"
Smells so much better than the original!!!
"
"
The real thing!! Thanks!
"
"
This stuff is terrible. I was looking for a more cleansing alternative to the No Poo, but this leaves my hair frizzy and burns my scalp. I like the conditioner, but I suspect it's thinning my hair. 😞
"

I got this product as part of the Wavy Mini Transformation Kit.  It includes the Low-Poo Delight, One Condition Delight, and Wave Maker, a styling mousse-cream.  I'm happy I had the opportunity to try out mini sizes of all three for only $12, because although I really wanted to love these products, I was largely dissatisfied.  (Also because it seems like some Amazon sellers sell knockoffs, and I know I got the real thing at an Ulta store, even if I didn't quite like it.)I have low porosity, fine, 2a/b/c hair, and a straight bottom layer.  I have oily roots, having to wash my hair every 2 days (stretch it to 3 once a week with a scalp cleanser), but the ends can get pretty dry once it's time for me to wash again.  While I used to always use a sulfate shampoo, I now use one only once weekly.  I do not include silicones in my hair routine, except for the occasional hair serum.  Therefore, I was pleased that the shampoo, conditioner, and styling product were sulfate- and silicone-free.When DevaCurl says ""Low-Poo"", they really mean it.  Because the Low-Poo Delight lathered so little, I felt like it was difficult to spread onto my scalp and that I had to use so much of it, not exactly what I want to do with the most expensive hair product brand I've ever purchased.  I have a cheap little shampoo brush from Sally's that I use for every wash.  Without that thing, there's no way this shampoo would clean my hair nearly enough.  In fact, I washed my hair with Johnson's Baby Shampoo once a few months ago, and it had the same issue with almost no lather, just for comparison.  Both have a fresh scent, but the DevaCurl Low-Poo Delight has a water lily scent, noticeably different from the Johnson's.The interesting thing about this shampoo is that when I wash with it, it makes my hair feel like the water is being all sealed in, the same way my hair feels when I use an oil-based deep conditioner such as the ORS Olive Oil Replenishing Pak.  I may like this for a conditioner, but not quite for a shampoo, considering that I have oily roots.  (While I don't like for my roots/scalp to be dry, which rarely happens anyway, too much moisture there makes it get oily faster.)As for how my hair looks after using both the shampoo and conditioner, I've tried them multiple times, in different weather conditions, and my hair has never come out looking as good as it does with my other shampoos and conditioners, even though my post-wash routine is generally the same.  The very first time using them both, I styled my hair with the Wave Maker, and while my hair looked amazing for a few hours after washing, for the next two days, the waves/curls were looser than usual, and I suppose it was the glycerin that caused it to frizz up a bit.  Other times I have used them, with the Wave Maker or other stylers, I've gotten frizzy hair and/or limp waves.  I do not use these products when I want my hair to look good, which is quite unfortunate considering DevaCurl's great reputation...and price tag.If I wanted a shampoo that hardly lathered that I had to use a ton of to properly cleanse my scalp, and left my waves looking anemic, I might as well buy Johnson's Baby Shampoo for a third of the cost per ounce.

Love this product.  It gives my hair soft beautiful curls and the smell is a delight.

My daughter swears by this product, and she once use the No Poo type, but felt she needed just a little bit more of a lather.  I am 56 yrs old and my hair is very fine and thin, and thinning more as the years pass.  Thought I would try this as a gentler alternative to my regular argan oil shampoo, but it just wasn't for me.  Smells great, makes a low lather as it should, and I used my regular conditioner, but it seems to leave my hair limp-ish and it tangled very, very easily.  I sleep with a silk pillowcase specifically to prevent tangling and pulling of my fragile hair, but this product just didn't help at all with the fragility and hair loss.  To be fair, my daughter has long, thin hair and she claims this works great for her.  She alternates between the Low Poo and and argan oil shampoo she purchases on Amazon as well

I  only use Deva Curl products on my long 2b hair. I purchased this bottle in January 2019 and still have more than half the shampoo left, so it's a good bargain as well. Does a great job cleaning and taking great care of my hair and smells wonderful, so needing maybe 1 12 oz bottle a year, the slightly higher price over many other shampoos is easier to spend. My favorite reason is this shampoo like all their other products contains no sulfates, parabens or silicones to damage my hair. It can't get any better than that : )) !!
"
"
I have tried and continue to use many DevaCurl products for my fine, loose curly hair but had never tried this shampoo. I really like this shampoo and will most likely buy the full size bottle once this runs out. I definitely notice that my curls are more defined and my hair is a lot less frizzy on the days I use this (rather than my Dove shampoo).  I find that if I use this for 3 or more days in a row that my hair appears a bit greasy by the crown of my head but when I alternate this with another shampoo every 2-3 days it works best for me. I would highly recommend this for adults or children with curly hair.
"
"
Very disappointed in this product.  It doesn't rinse out very well.  I had tried a sample for a few days and it seemed to settle my curls into good waves with some curl.  So I bought this big bottle. After a few weeks, my hair was heavy and flat.  The product just doesn't completely rinse out, and it builds up in the hair over time.  Cannot recommend this product at all.I use the DevaCurl Low-Poo (not the ""Delight"") every day, and I love it.  The Delight is not a delight.
"
"
I love this product line (hence why I made the investment to purchase the 32 oz bottle.) This product  in tandem with the matching conditioner, allows me to have 2,3, hair which is awesome. For extra moisture I will cowash on a separate wash day with Asiam  coconut cowash  for additional moisture if needed. Using the DevaCurl Low-Poo line, I don't have to clarify cleanse to avoid product build up as much.
"
"
This is a nice, lightweight shampoo. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that my daughter's hair feels coarser than it normally does when using this shampoo. It's a little more frizzy, too. I've used other curly hair shampoos that seem to work a little better. Maybe it's better for a different type of curly hair. The price was right, though!
"
"
Wonderful scent, easy to use, and the low-suds formula feels like a very gentle way to wash my hair, yet my hair feels very clean after use. Of course, I wish DevaCurl products were less expensive; that would be the biggest deterrent as far as staying with the brand. Of all the DevaCurl products I've tried Low-Poo is the one I would most highly recommend.
"
"
I actually really like this shampoo - and I am a bit of a snob when it comes to cleaning my hair.I normally purchase Aveeno shampoo & conditioner, but after trying a sample of this Low-Poo Mild Lather from Deva Curl, I am hooked!My hair feels great (soft to the touch) & very clean. The price is more than I would like to pay, but it is worth it.I definitely would recommend this to ANYONE - not just curly haired people!
"
"
Product consistency was like rubber cement. It was not well mixed and I product would not mix well into hair. This happened with two bottles. It is as if you are selling old shampoo. I have used DevaCurl shampoo in the past and loved it. This product is not the same quality.
"
"
Love this conditioner. It’s light and works well into my hair making it manageable. I keep a sprayer with some conditioner and water which I use when setting my hair and need to keep wet or moist. I have also used a s leave in conditioner.
"
"
This is not even shampoo consistency. It’s more like slime or jelly. Plus about 1/5 spilled before I got it but I guess that doesn’t really matter when I’m never going to use it again.  Do not buy!
"
"
I don’t care for these products at all.  This doesn’t get your hair clean at all. My hair looked oily the day after washing.  Waste of money.
"
"
This cleanser make my scalp feel like bugs are crawling all over it,  and my hsir has stsrted falling out.  Sadly it is past my window to do s return.
"
"
I like the no-poo, but this stuff is terrible. It leaves my hair feeling so damaged and tangled and disgusting. I will go back to the No Poo, and never turn back. I would rather use a normal sulfate shampoo than this low poo variant. Avoid
"
"
This shampoo caused my hair to feel limp and greasy,  Also started losing a lot of hair and my scalp started breaking out.Stopped quarter way through the bottle & threw it out.  Started using Bed Head moisture maniac shampoo & my hair hasn't looked better.
"
"
The product is ok, but the liquid is very thin so I end up using a lot of shampoo to get my hair clean. Also, this is the second shipment in a row in which I have received a bottle that is not completely full. I am not planning to order this product again.
"
"
Not sure this is Deva Curl. It got very runny then globby. I think the ingredients separated so I shook it to emulsify them together then pumped out what was left in the pump. Works fine after. I shake it often.
"
"
Recommended for my natural curls.  Hard to find in my area.
"
"
While I don't love no-poo, this is PERFECT for my wavy curls!  Cleans without stripping, smells good and gentle enough to use daily or every other.  This is now my go-to shampoo!
"
"
Our whole family uses this product.  It's mild but still produces some of the foam that we are used to.  I like the way my hair feels.  Great product.
"
"
Great price! Works great for people with curly hair.
"
"
Worked as advertised.  Came in a timely fashion.  😊
"
"
Nice smell, keeps my hair clean without stripping it too badly. Good alternative to no-poo for those that need to get rid of some buildup
"
"
I recommend
"
"
This is a newer product from DevaCurl and is even better than their previous low-poo.  It is a great product.  No suds, but it does clean well.Highly recommend it for curly hair (and other types as well).
"
"
buy it every couple of months. Love it!
"
"
as described for less money.
"
"
Leaves my hair feeling ""healthy clean"" and has a nice light scent.
"
"
Not bad. Wish it didn't have a fragrance
"
"
The name is the perfect description : delight. nothing better. If combined with wave maker, perfect match.
"
"
Very pleased with this shampoo. It came securely packaged with no leaks. Thank you!
"
"
Perfect for fine, fragile, oily hair like mine.
"
"
fast delivery. will defiantly order again
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
Exactly when the hair salon sells, but at a cheaper price. Very happy with the product and the shipping.
"
"
Fantastic shampoo - not drying but it leaves my hair and scalp clean!
"
"
Since I started using this I've tried so hard to get used to the smell... It's pretty bad. Now it's just not worth it. I am getting the most weak strands, split ends, and breakage I've ever had in my life. Absolute nightmare! When I run my fingers through my hair it feels like my hair is breaking at the root. And my scalp just hurts when my hair moves.
"
"
love the smell of the delight!
"
"
I really wanted to love this as I've been reading a lot about the ""no-poo"" movement to have better hair health by not washing it as often or with strong detergents and sulfates that can dry it out, only to add back moisture in the form of silicones. Based on the enthusiastic reviews I gave it a try despite the higher-than-I'm-used-to price tag. The first time I used it I thought it was great as I didn't use a conditioner based on how hydrated my hair felt, so I didn't think I needed one. However, after several weeks my opinion has fallen. Yes it does not lather like traditional shampoo, but I knew that going in. I have no problem with the smell either. My problem is that my hair has begun to feel oily-more so than if I just didn't wash my hair for a few days. It feels that way just after showering. When it dries, it feels dry. I know that that does not make sense, but it was frizzier than usual and felt ""thick"" for lack of a better word (maybe heavy is a better word?), instead of silky/smooth/run your fingers through it. I did not really appreciate a change in my waves or curls. I have an occupation that requires me to have to wash my hair every day, and so I thought this would be a good, minimalist alternative. I'll go back to my Herbal Essences.
"
"
Great product.  Need to alternate a few times a month to avoid buildup.  My hair is thin and curly.
"
"
Just like I bought in salon. Leaves my curly hair soft and clean. They have added a new scent but I like it.
"
"
Great, makes my hair into big beautiful curls.
"
"
I have dealt with scalp issues (seborrheic dermatits) for years and have generally determined that it's caused by detergents in soap.  I have tried countless different ones - seeking natural alternatives free of the most common chemicals in shampoo, but to no or little avail until this product.  My wife ordered it for herself and I have used it for several weeks now and I'm the most pleased I've ever been for years.  My scalp stays pretty calm and the oil production has dropped considerably.
"
"
The smell of this 'shampoo' is the exact same smell as SUPERGLUE. Highly 'chemical' smelling. I'm not joking. What's worse is after only 3 washes with a sample my stylist gave me for my curls, it has made my hair heavy and flay and slick. And it has taken 2 washes with real shampoo to get it off :-( Not happy with this at all; would not recommend for any type of hair, even course, tight curls.  So bad it's worth writing a review so others don't waste their money...!
"
"
The original low poo shampoo is great.  This ""Delight Low Poo"" is awful.  It smells horrible like a cheap colon and it does not rinse out well and tangles the hair.  I tried to force myself to start using some that I have left so it doesn't go to waste, but I just can't do it.  The smell is so offensive.  I did not buy it from Amazon unfortunately so I am stuck with it. I think the rest is going into the garbage.
"
"
The shampoo works ok for my hair but the smell is such a departure from the previous sweet and fruity smells in deva curl and it smells like all the perfume ads in a women's magazine all combined. It smells so much of factory made smells and chemicals. It is also a smell that is in other hair products that's really strong and totally fake smelling. I don't even like walking behind people who smell like this. It's kinda like the smell of hairspray. I loved deva curl until this. They've lost me and now I'm hesitant to try anything else simply because of the smelly garbage they put in this - does everything smell overpowering now that the line has been revamped? I'll be keeping my money in my pocket until I hear otherwise. Or, giving it to aveda. They have a nice cowash. Get that instead. This has become junk.
"
"
Works great on my wavy/curly hair. Doesn't weigh hair down.
"
"
The original no poo is a better cleanser. I feel like this product never leaves your hair feeling clean and I don't see any positive changes in my hair. :/
"
"
I have used this shampoo many times before and LOVED it. I decided to purchase the larger sizes from Amazon; however, the shampoo is not at all like the previous bottles I have purchased. The shampoo is the consistency of hair gel, it dispenses in a clumpy, sticky mess. I will not buy this product from Amazon again.
"
"
I've been using the low-poo delight shampoo and conditioner for quite some time now. I just ran out of my last bottles and had ordered this, but there is something wrong. The shampoo isn't the right consistency - it's not supposed to be sticky, like gel. It doesn't even lather and the scent is different too. I can't use it - this seems like fake DevaCurl to me. I will be buying my DevaCurl directly from them from now on.
"
"
I have used Deva Curl products for 4 years.  I switched to the Delight Low-Poo and One Condition and it is awful.  It makes my hair frizzy, dry and unmanageable.  When I wash my hair the Delight Low-Poo makes my hair feel like I can't even put my fingers through my hair.  I wished I had not bought a big bottle.  I'm not sure if this is what the product is suppose to be or if the company that I bought it from substituted something else in the bottles, but it is the worse. It was sold by salon*expo.  I will never buy again.
"
"
FRAUD!  I have used this shampoo for years... with great results.  I purchased the first time from this vendor and the consistency of the shampoo seemed off and sticky.  Color was darker than normal too.... more beige than clear.  I didnt think anything of it... just that they reformulated the product... I bought it a second time from this vendor and the same consistency came thru... and then the unthinkable happened!  my hair started to fall out and break off.  I thought I was dying and went to many doctors and many test later... they found nothing wrong with me physically and was told that i was stressed.  but my hair continued to fall out.  We finally figured out it was this shampoo that was causing the damage!  Had it tested against the actual formula and was told that this was NOT the original formula.I stopped using this and my hair is just starting to grow back but they say it will take years to fully recover.  Stay away from this product.  Be very afraid if you chose to ignore this warning.
"
"
I am a Devacurl girl and use these products exclusively and even go to Devacut stylists to get my hair cut. I am positive that this is not real Devacurl, the scent is not right and when I used it it felt different than when I buy it at a salon or Ulta. Buyer beware! We spend thousands of dollars a year on Amazon and this was so disappointing to me!
"
"
This is supposed to be awesome for waves. The conditioner was not moisturizing. I was not impressed with the cleansing of the low-poo over the no-poo. My defined waves turned into a single strands of frizz that floated and danced like fine snakes from Medusa's head, but not nearly as cool. Really disappointed that I purchased such a large container for a trial run. However, I can say with certainty that either of these products did not work for my 2B/2C hair except to create a crown of frizz.
"
"
I really enjoy this product. I've been using the Deva Curl No-Poo, and switched to this one that has a little lather.... somehow I feel that my scalp does not get as oily.... I wash every 3days.... I use the conditioner 1x/week. I love the scent too! I have 3c curls medium length hair.... I notice more curl definition when I use this product. I also use the Deva Curl gel.
"
"
I have wavy curly hair, and most “curly” shampoos I’ve found are too heavy for my curls. This is my FAVORITE shampoo and conditioner! It makes my curls soft and healthy and shiny, while also not weighting them down. I pair it with the Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel after I shower, and my curls look great for 1-3 days. Highly recommend these products, especially for folks with wavy curly hair!And these large bottles are great for the shower. It’s worth the investment to not have small bottles that don’t last very long. These larger bottles last me around 4-5 months.
"
"
I thought my hair was fine but this shampoo and conditioner didn't seem to work too well on my hair. The conditioner didn't really soften my hair much I had to use alot of it. The shampoo doesn't really create a lather which I like but I guess thats what its suppose to do. My hair is usually a mix of greasy and dry but this makes my hair all the way dry.
"
"
This is an amazing deal on what would be almost $100 worth of product if you bought at ulta. I’m not even 1/4 of the way through the conditioner and I’ve been using these for a month (and I use A LOT of conditioner). I have high porosity 2b/2c waves/curls and this duo gives me a perfect balance of moisture and volume. Best shampoo and conditioner I’ve ever used!

The shampoo was not what I expected because my hair feels oily after washing it with the Loo Poo Shampoo, even if i rinse several times and use a small amount of product.I am really disappointed because I expected to be a great product and to have great wavy hair after using it,  because I considered Deva Cruls Shampoo and Conditioner, from the reviews I read, that it was the best product line for wavy and curly hair but once I tried it did not like it at all.Will not buy again.
"
"
I have wavy and frizzy hair so I was excited to try out devacurl after all of the hype. I was very unimpressed by how an expensive product does virtually nothing to combat my frizz or tame waves. I used it as directed and even watched videos to make sure I was using it right. Also bought the wave maker mousse which does nothing as well.
"
"
This has to be altered! It is not the same as I’ve gotten in the past. The scent is different and lathers differenty, couldn’t place it at first then it  hit me! It smells like Joy dish detergent!!!! My shampoo definitely wasn’t closed right and had leaked. When I get a chance I will stop at an Ulta to smell theirs, if it’s different then what I purchased here I will know immediately!!!
"
"
I’ve been using this product on my myself and my daughter for a while now. I finally decided to go for the bigger bottles and the shampoo is the consistency of slime or wet glue. Reading back on other reviews I see this isn’t the first time a customer has complained about this issue. Definitely buying from the manufacturer from now on!
"
"
GREAT price! I saved $30, buying from the salon is much more expensive. I don't wear my hair naturally curly that often but I still love this product and use it every day. My hair holds curl better, doesn't get greasy and the product doesn't clog my pores (something I've had a lot of trouble with in the past). It also smells nice and doesn't leave any residue in your shower. I will continue to buy this over and over again!
"
"
Get stopped constantly by people who want to talk about my great curly hair or my daughters FANTASTIC curls. I have easily made 100+ referrals to the Deva Curl line. Those who I know personally that have bought it- love it. (That doesn’t account for the strangers that stop me).
"
"
This product is fantastic. I’ve read some of the negative comments.  One thing you must remember is to remove build up once a month.  Without sulfates, your hair can build up with products.  Deva curl recommends this.  I do and have great success.
"
"
DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! If you do your research and use this product correctly, you will love it! I have been using it for a few weeks and my hair is so wavy/curly! I get compliments on it all the time now and I am loving embracing my curls!
"
"
Awesome shampoo - doesn't weigh hair down AT ALL - great scent! So excited to come across it!
"
"
I have used Deva for a longtime and ordered this as a refill.  I didn't realize this was a different kind of Deva.  I have always used the unscented version.  This stuff stinks like perfume.  I am not too pleased.  I didn't even know they made a version with perfume in it.  Why do companies make their products stink like this?
"
"
I have thick curly hair, I prefer the original one
"
"
I have used this shampoo and conditioner for two years now.  I purchased the big bottles straight from the salon last time.  I worry this has substitutions or fillers added.  The shampoo is a much darker color than previously (I still have a little left), and it doesn't work into my hair.  It is very stringy and globs up in my hair!
"
"
I didn't realize Deva Curl came out with a new fragrance.  The scent gives me an instant headache.  Please note the yellow top indicates a different smell than the ORIGINAL.  Won't ever buy it again.  The company was fine; I just didn't realize it was a different scent until it was too late to return it.
"
"
I love this product but when i opened the box the shampoo had leaked out and was messy besides losing the product i paid for.
"
"
Buyer beware. This is not authentic devacurl products. If you’ve used them in the past, then you’d know that the  cleanser does not lather as it is not a traditional shampoo. This shampoo is thicker than it should be and lathers like any other shampoo. Spend the extra money to buy authentic products at a salon or ulta!
"
"
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter, but we both love this product. Leaves your hair soft, curly and very moisturized.
"
"
You get a ton of product in the pump bottles
"
"
Love these product they work amazing on my curls. So happy I found them. Only complaint the packaging need to be better product was full of leaked soap.
"
"
Gifted this to my sister in law, she loves it! Uses it every wash and her hair is looking amazing!
"
"
Got this for my boyfriend who has super-thick, very curly long hair (think Slash). He loves this stuff and he is definitely not a ""product"" guy. Great price too!
"
"
I love this product, is great for my curly hair. The price has gone up a little bit, but can not get anything else. Shipping was fast, I love when it arrives in time!
"
"
The shampoo has an inconsistent texture to it - its best described as gummy. I've purchased this several times and it was fine, but this time I believe it should not have passed a quality control check.  The conditioner is just fine - as always
"
"
The shampoo in the bottle is like slimy jell.This is not a original product and i am not sure why after so many feedback that its a fake product still amazon is allowing this product to be sold.Extremely disappointed.
"
"
weighed down my fine hair.  Not a fan.
"
"
Only brand I use! Lasts me a year washing 2-3x a week.
"
"
Works awesomely for my wavy hair.My only buyer-be-ware is that the shampoo does not bubble or foam which can take some getting used to.I also feel like I have to wash my hair more often than I would with a bubbling sulfate-free shampoo but, honestly, it is worth it!
"
"
Everything arrived on time and as expected in very good condition. I am extremely happy with my purchase and I will purchase again from the seller
"
"
Suggestion:  before shipping, make sure the lids are tightly on (both leaked but were in plastic and messy to get out if the bag).
"
"
HUGE savings over ULTA
"

I’ve used Deva curl for years this one smells the best in my opinion.
"
"
Works well on my very fine, wavy hair. Other heavier products weigh down my waves and curls, but this product works and it keeps my hair moisturized and healthy.
"
"
Awful. Made my hair feel like straw - even after conditioning could barely get a comb thru it. Also really don't like the scent - smells like bad, cheap cologne. Even if you have naturally wavy hair like me, stick with the original Low Poo for curly hair!!!
"
"
This product works well on my curly salt & pepper hair. My only complaint is that the bottle was open and about 1/4 of the shampoo was poured inside the box.
"
"
Love this product but unfortunately the shampoo cap was not on tight and the delivery driver left the box on its end. So I have plenty of conditioner but a box full of shampoo.
"
"
This works beautifully in my curly/wavy hair!  Love it!
"
"
My hair really likes this. Thank you for improving it.
"
"
I love the product it works wonders. My rating has to do with the fact my last order came with the shampoo bottle top loose and it had leaked a couple ounce into the box. For the cost it’s irrit that part of the product was gone.
"
"
I love Devacurl
"
"
Much more soapy than I expected, but I love the smell!!
"
"
Love love love
"
"
Great for curl.
"
"
This is absolutely wonderful for my hair and brings my curls out
"
"
Scam. Was watered down.
"
"
I love this product so much and I got it for cheaper and it was prime so I was very happy when I ordered it
"
"
My daughter loves this.
"
"
LOVE! Best shampoo for light, thin, curly hair.
"
"
DONT BUY
"
"
Nice and light with great fragrance.
"
"
THE BEST shampoo and conditioner for wavy hair!
"
"
This is not an imitation! Sold by amazon from Deva as its noted above. This is the DELIGHT version of their product so it works a little differently and smells different. This is my personal favorite for my hair type. DEVA offers 3 different shampoos for different hair types. Best shampoo for curls I've found and I love their light gel. Leaves my hair feeling soft and natural not crunchy.
"
"
Love this shampoo
"
"
Had extreme hair fall. Deva curl customer service staff is not helpful at all,just transfer you to voice mail in the middle of conversation. All reps say the same line like babies "" we are the only authorized ones to sell and if you purchased else where its not our product"". wonder why they have a find a stylist tab on their website???
"
"
Great product at a great price. This bundle is still a better deal even when devacurl has a sale. I always buy from amazon.
"
"
Love the product, hate the way it arrived.  The package arrived with damaged products.  The shampoo bottle cap was broken and much of the shampoo contents spilled throughout the package.  Spent too much money for it to arrive in this condition.
"
"
Bought this as a set and the shampoo bottles leaked during shipment and 1/4 of the product was lost.
"
"
These products are just awful. They  have turned my wavy hair into a frizzy and greasy mess. They coat the hair with a slimy residue. The smell is also not very nice. What a waste of money. Disappointed. Going in the trash.
"
"
The perfect combo for wavy hair!  I started using the no poo about a year ago and then switched to the low poo because my hair is more wavy than curly in most places.  I'm amazed.  My hair is so healthy and shiny. It has so much body and curls up more than it did with the no poo.  I love the smell and feel of my hair.  This is the perfect duo for wavy to curly hair.
"
"
Please don't buy this product it will cause your hair to fall out and break. I lost 1/3 of my hair during 2 months I was using it.
"
"
Really good product super moisturizing.
"
"
This is not the same quality as the (same) DevaCurl products I have used in the past.  They smell different and made my hair flat, dry and a completely different experience than I have had in the padt..  I can't help but feel like these are a knock off.  I should have known for the price.
"
"
I don’t even know why I bought this - I know you’re running the risk of getting something fake off amazon and it def is fake. I’ve been using deva products for over 10 years - this weirdly tacky, off smelling stuff is not it. Luckily deva has a sale every few months and you can get this bundle plus 12 extra ounces of conditioner for $4 more - and you know it’s the real stuff. If you’re reading this, trust me, spend the $4, it’s well worth it!
"
"
The ladies of the house really like both products. Me.. I’m bald so I will never feel the luxurious mane that these products will produce. This is a low foaming product so don’t over do and think you need more because it doesn’t foam up, like somebody in my house that blew though both bottles in under two weeks because “I just kept adding more to get it to foam!”. I might as well as lit $80 bucks on fire. I digress. It works very well on curly hair.
"
"
As previous reviewers have stated there is something off with the shampoo and conditioner that comes from this seller. The shampoo is sticky to the point it is hard to even work into your hair and hard to rinse out. The conditioner does not work correctly either. It appears to be fake which, if you go to devacurl's website they have a blog post about this being a problem. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. I suggest buying from another seller.
"
"
I had been using the No-Poo for about a year, and my stylist recommended I switch to the Low-Poo.  I only wash my hair about 2 times a week, so it lasts forever. It smells amazing, and I compared the ingredients to the bottle from Ulta and it matches. Great price!
"
"
The product is awesome! Leaves my 2c/3a/3b hair soft and shiny and doesn't weigh down my very fine strands. I took off one star because the lid of the shampoo wasn't tight and had leaked inside the package.
"
"
My daughter absolutely loves this product.  We have to order it again :)  It's all she uses and it works well on her hair.  It smells terrific and her hair is more manageable than ever.  Great product.  I read other reviews where the product was watered down...this was not the case for us.
"
"
This low poo seems watered down. It runs right off my hand and is lacking fragrance. Makes me wonder if this is not the real thing. To be clear, I have been using these products for a while so I know what yo be expect and this isn't it.
"
"
Perfect for my Low Po 3A hair! I needed less moisture and more protein and this line was amazing.The low-poo is less than desireable in scent but it does an incredible job! No harsh sulfates in it at all, lathers nicely.The conditioner is AMAZING!! It smells so good, like a lemony-sandalwood but not overpowering.I was surprised to see the amount of protein in both products and will continue using them in my routine.
"
"
For my 3b-type hair, I think I'll stick with DevaCurl's No Poo & One Condition. Overall, this delight version is great, leaves my hair smooth & smells fantastic, however my curls appreciate the No Poo & One Condition better.
"
"
Just the right amount of cleansing and moisturization so it protects fine delicate curly hair. I like that it doesn't weigh my hair down. I'm not a fan of the overly sweet scent but love the larger size.
"
"
do not buy this product it looks exactly like it should but it has no smell and performs terribly it is a knock off and not true devacurl products.
"
"
Best price I’ve seen on these products and I LOVE the way it leaves my hair feeling and smelling. Pricey for shampoo but worth it if you need lots of hydration.
"
"
I've always used the no-poo version, but this is really good for my curly hair.
"
"
I really love Deva Curl products for my Curly hair. I prefer the Low-Poo shampoo to the No-Poo variety because I like some suds.
"
"
Usually buy Diva Curl original low poo... On accident bought the Delight version. Hate it because my hair feels like it isn't clean a couple hours after washing.If you are debating which to buy - go with the Original (green cap not yellow)
"
"
I love love diva curl and these large pump bottles are a great calue
"
"
My curls look amazing and the price was excellent!
"
"
Makes your hair fall out.
"
"
Great stuff for wavy hair
"
"
This is fantastic for thin/fine curly hair! I found the regular no poo weighs my hair down too much--this helped a lot with that!
"
"
The conditioner is really hard to comb out in the shower but once it's combed out it leaves my hair very soft! For best results use it with diva curl styling cream
"
"
Great shampoo and conditioner for daily use. Very light and cleans nicely.  Smells fresh and clean too.
"
"
I did not like this at all. It gave my hair a very nasty texture and feel. I returned after a few uses. I love the low-poo original and one condition original duo. I recommend that highly over the Delight line.
"
"
The perfect products for wavy hair! The low poo gets a nice foam and the conditioner is lightweight, leaving my curls hydrated but not weighed down!
"
"
I love this shampoo and conditioner. I love how fast it was delivered but I was not happy because the conditioner bottle was broken at the top and the conditioner was spilled out all over and the pump doesn’t work
"
"
love these products do exactly what they say they do
"
"
Esta marca es la mejor
"
"
Love this product!! Really brings out my waves and is perfectly weightlesa!
"
"
I love this!  Keeps my hair soft and wavy.  I've been using Deva Curl products for years now.  Always happy.
"
"
Great for finer, curly hair!
"
"
Would give it -1 stars if I could.  I switched from low-poo (which I had used successfully for a year) to this, and after about a month my hair started shedding like crazy -- enough to make a Barbie wig after every shampoo.  I didn't shed any other time of the day except for washing and styling my hair.  I stopped using the Deva line shampoo and conditioner month ago and am shedding a normal amount now.  I don't know what the hell is in here that would cause this, but beware.....
"
"
I'm a big fan of the Deva Curl products. I've been using them for years now with fabulous results. My stylist recommended that I try the Delight series because it's made for wavy hair, rather than out and out curly hair. I tried this product once and I will never use it again. The smell is TERRIBLE. It's like cheap, knock off CK cologne. It took a week to get the smell out of my hair and pillow and shower. The whole bathroom reeked. DO NOT BUY.
"
"
Bought this for my wavy hair daughter and it is worth every penny. No more hazle with tangled hair and cries over them. Hair is moist, shiny, and for the first time im completely satisfy for a shampo for curly hair.
"
"
Prefer the original for my particular hair type.
"
"
Can't get bottles open. Difficult to unlock pumps. Still can't.
"
"
Edited 5/9/17After more research I found this product line to be on the Deva Curl website. Apparently there is this completely different product line. I was thinking this was the ""original"" scent. It is not. Although I still do not like this scent and it's consistancy it does seem to be real Deva Curl. I know now there are different lines within Deva Curl.Original review:This is not Deva Curl! Products smells and feels completely different! I contacted Deva Curl to see if they changed their formula to explain the new scent and product but they assured me they hadn't! Will not buy again! Do not buy!
"
"
Within 12 hours of using this shampoo my scalp starts to itch. Within 24 hours it itches so badly I have to wash it again to get the itching to stop. As soon as I go back to using regular shampoo the itching stops.  I ordered mine directly from the company so I know it's an authentic product. I hate to throw it out because it is so expensive but I really didn't notice that it made any difference in my hair anyway.
"
"
I recently tried this product for my wavy hair and finally, I can have wavy hair that doesn't frizz up, feel crunchy, or look cheap - until now, I had to always blow out my hair straight.  Now, instead I can add some Deva styling cream, scrunch, and let it air dry into pretty voluminous waves.  Thank you DevaCurl.  I also like the smell, it is fresh but not too fruity or floral.  I tried the no poo and didn't feel it worked for my hair and the smell was too minty.
"
"
*Update* I used the products again this morning but left out the volumizing foam. My hair is not as weighed down as last time and definitely less frizzy than last time as well. I bought a head massaging brush to use along with the shampoo and my hair feels clean this time around. I used more gel to add definition to my curls and it worked without looking stiff. I will continue using and may repurchase if I don't find a similar product line with a better price point.I don't know if this is the real product or not. It doesn't have the citrusy smell everyone talks about. It smells like a man's cologne. Strong. Maybe I am just sensitive to the smell. The products were all unsealed as well, which caused them to leak during shipping. Perhaps they usually come unsealed, I don't know. Seemed suspicious, as ebay lists them as ""sealed"" and ""genuine"". I just tried them for the first time, assuming they were a fake product, but the shampoo did not lather so I thought, ""Ah, maybe it is genuine."" I then used the conditioner. It was thick and creamy, but smells awful as well. Followed by the volumizing foam and then the gel. My hair now looks extremely flat and frizzy/dry on the ends, despite focusing my attention to them.  We will see how it dries and I will update in a few days after continued use. I'm sure it takes time. I don't want to set my expectations too high! So far, 3 stars.
"
"
I bought this for the first time after doing some research on the product for my hair type and I wish I had bought this sooner. I love the way it smells and the way it makes my natural waves look. I can actually wear my hair naturally and it look great! It takes the waves, frizz and makes it smell so good. I can’t say enough about how great this shampoo/conditioner + bonus products are!!
"
"
I ordered this to see if the product would help my waves be more pronounced and add volume to my hair. It did exactly that! Also smells good! I highly recommend this product for those wanting to try to get waves out there from hiding and show them off all day long! 😁👍👍👍
"
"
Starting the curly girl method and this was a great value to give it a try. Also the low poo is a good switch from conventional cleanser
"
"
Works great on my daughter's curls!!!
"
"
Bought this as a gift for my cousin who has ringlets, her hair started shedding more after just one use and cause her scalp to become dry and itchy after about 3 days of use. I think the formula may be different than before.
"
"
AMAZING PRODUCT! Don’t like the wash day product too much doesn’t work as I expected it to as a deranged but all the other products are fabulous!!
"
"
Does not clean my hair, is like & feels like conditioner every time. The battles are small for that expensive price. Not please at all. I will not buy it again.
"
"
I love how my curls come to life and they aren’t hard or crunchy.

Made my hair more dry and frizzy

*Let me be clear that I do not think that these or other DevaCurl products are bad, they are just wrong for me.* I am not sure why but Devacurl products disagree with my hair and scalp. My stylist insisted I was using the wrong ones or using them wrong. So after a very expensive haircut and ""Curl Transformation"" she recommended the Decadence line. It makes me itch. I love the smell, I really wanted it to work, I wanted to love it but they really dont leave my hair that soft for the how weighed down it is. I have tried doing the ""noodling"" as I was shown at the salon which leave quite a bit of conditioner in my hair and that is super itchy, heavy and leaves me with no curl definition at all.
"
"
I Absolutely love DevaCurl products and being a curly girl, I've tried a ton of products. Although they are pricey, they are so worth it. Amazon makes them much more affordable and this pack is the best pricing you're going to get! I have a hard time with moisture retention and my hair overall looking dull. It is also during the winter months that my hair gets SUPER DRY. The No-Poo and Decadence condition are the only products I have come across that help my hair stay moisturized and healthy. After one use, you feel the difference. After a week, even more so, and after a few weeks, you know the money was well worth it. I recommend these products to EVERY curly girl.The curl cream is just as amazing. A little actually goes a long way and it coats your hair in moisture and when it dries, it leaves your hair looking healthy and shiny!I am a mixed black female with curly hair. If i had to pick a curl type, it would be between 3c and 4a - I thought this information would be helpful to include :)
"
"
I hated diva curls till the time I learned in devasalon how to use it. Now I can say this is the best brand ever, it gave new life to my dull, dry and fizzy hair. Earlier I was using noo poo shampoo and conditioner, heard a lot about this series so wanted to try , I received this product 2 days back, it was perfectly packed. And with this product there were few free samples which I loved it. Shampoo and conditioner made my hair super smooth and after using super cream and styler my curls came out beautifully.
"
"
One of the bottles was slightly opened and some product leaked out. Hoping that this hasn’t been filled with some other conditioner...
"
"
Really great product I had quite an experience with it My hair felt a little bit other moisturize. On the other hand the other member of my family has his hair all pretty, shiny and healthy after using it. I definitely recommend it for anybody who need a boost of moisture for their curls.
"
"
My Cantu system which is a third of the price works much better than this overpriced crap. Dries out my curls and leaves them straight. Legit get Cantu shampoo, conditioner and curl activator for $20 and it’s bomb.
"
"
The shampoo doesn’t clean deep enough, it’s really gently to your hair. I have dry hair and even though it moisturizes I’d rather it to clean it better. The conditioner and leave are moisturizing but not the best ones I’ve tried unfortunately.
"
"
I love these Deva Curl products for my 3C hair. The cleanser and conditioner are  wonderful. The SuperCream is very moisturizing, with a slight hold, smells nice and a little goes a long way.
"
"
So far, I’m loving devacurl Products. They left my hair feeling quite soft. Imo, this would be the best starter bundle if a styling gel is added to it. The first thing I noticed was the scent... it smells somewhat... “plain”! I don’t hate it though. I’m just used to the tropical scents of Maui Moisture.Products arrived well sealed, no spillage whatsoever.
"
"
I like the product because my hair became soft and curly. However, I think the products are a bit expensive, and it is better to buy a big volume of product to add value to your money.

Was given as Christmas gift to a naturally curly relative. She was excited over it, loved the sizes of products included. So far no complaints.
"
"
This is the only product I use. If you have curly hair, this will be the best shampoo for you. Great price. Anywhere else, it would be almost $100
"
"
I can’t tell the difference between this and the original.  The scent isn’t as strong.
"
"
Good product but not a strong scent. Hard to get used to No Poo no suds.
"
"
Like it! It's a little getting used to not having all the suds but my hair feels and looks great!
"
"
Love this product for my daughters hair!
"
"
Deva Curl is the best product out there.  I love using it and I couldn't ask for a better product.  The scent of the decadence line is AMAZING!
"
"
Great for curls or waves. I’ve been using these products for 10 years +
"
"
Love it for my curly hair
"

Love this product!

Fantastic moisturizer and curl enhancing

Deva curl is a great product for wavy, curly hair.  Moisturizes curls. Love it!

Awesome

Queda el cabello  super lindo rulos naturales

I'm a Deva Curl addict. My daughter's hair is super curly and needs a lot of moisture and Deva Curl delivers! It's the best product line that I have ever found for thick curls.
"
"
I always liked this product. It seems to give my hair more body
"
"
Product is great. Used it for years but the shipping was TERRIBLE. The products were so damaged that it torn through the plastic wrap and leaked onto the box. There was no protection inside the box.
"
"
Daughter and I are very happy with this product. Works great for our curly hair and helps with frizz
"
"
My favorites hair products
"
"
Love it! Arrived in great shape
"
"
Deva curl products are awesome
"
"
I love this product, however, when i received the package, the products were all over the place and the seals were a little messed up.
"
"
Esta es mi segunda compra de shampo y el acondicionador, los amo. La supercream es lo mejor
"
"
The smell ,softness
"

Helps to bring back the curl’s
"

Es el mejor producto que he encontrado para el cabello de mis nietas.
"

Great product to tease out curls. Very moisturizing!
"
"
Great products, dislike the scent
"
"
Miss litebrite Sharise loves the smell
"
"
The best product amazing!!!!
"
"
Love the devacurl products but unfortunately the cream opened during shipping
"
"
Product tops leaked a bit in shipping but was packed/wrapped well.
"
"
It Came fast and it works Wonderful
"
"
Love this product
"
"
I searched for many years for a product that would make my 3c/4a (crown) hair soft and manageable. I’ve been natural for over 10 years. This is by far the best product I’ve used. My hair is so soft and manageable. I comb through it in a matter of 2-3 minutes (it was previously about 30 minutes in multiple small sections). It is so moisturized I can actually dry comb my hair without spritzing it with water. I was never able to do that before. My stylist recommended this product about a year ago and I’m so glad she did. I am actually retaining length since my hair is not dry and broken off. I LOVE this product.
"
"
 Love the way Deva curl works in my hair! My curls are softer and healthier.
"
"
At first I loved this product. But the longer I used it the more my hair seem to build a “tolerance” to it and my hair became  frizzy when using it.
"
"
I've lived with my frizzy dry curly hair my whole life, constantly searching for a product that would tame the mane. Deva not only tames it, but what used to be an embarassing mob, is now my crowning achievement... i have soft ringlets that drape beautifully down my back. I finally love my locks and compliments are continuous... thank you Deva for ending the frizz fight and delivering a knock out product!!!!
"
"
My daughter has been using this product for months and had the tightest bounciest curles and now they are not so curly and not as pretty as they used to be. Not happy at all
"
"
Love this product! However, it is pricey & one of the containers was not tightened when I got it and the product got all over the inside packaging. Lost a little bit & with price that’s unacceptable. 😒
"
"
DevaCurl has some great products, this being one of them.  I do have curly hair but tend to blow it dry with a round brush. My thick hair is soft and shiny with this no poo moisturizing product.
"
"
It’s too expensive for what you get if you ask me.. there is nothing spectacular about this shampoo and conditioner combo.
"
"
We've been using on our kids for a while now.  This brand is the best we've found for our kids.  It's a keeper.

Love love love!!! I didn’t even realize when I bought it that it would come with the supercream and I am SO glad it did. It has become my go-to product. And of course I love the shampoo/conditioner!
"
"
Great purchase.  Love these products.
"
"
Our favorites full of moisture and leaves our hair silky and soft..
"
"
Great product line!

I have been wearing my hair 'natural' for about 2 years and have tried just about every product safe for a curly girl.  Gels are too heavy and only last one day, but I only wash my hair once or twice a week, so for a couple of days I braid or ponytail it (my hair is pretty long).  I have a mixed up mess on my head.  I have some that's 1a, 2b-c 3a, etc.  I thought what the heck - I've tried everything else, so I tried it.  Are you kidding me?  It's perfect!!! It's not heavy, it doesn't get sticky and still looks good on day 4 or 5.  I sleep with it loose and when I get up it's mostly ok (silk pillowcase) and all I have to do is spray it with a little bit of conditioner water and it goes back in place.  I think the key is using it on wet (not dripping) hair and using the deva towel to scrunch.  I'll just say - it's amazing, for me anyway. Did I mention that  the humidity has been around 100% for the past week - no problem - seriously.

Shipping was quick and easy! This product does not work for me. It gives me no volume but it leaves my hair silky soft. The only reason why I don’t knock it is because I’ve seen it work wonders for other women. I have 2b/2c hair but my hair is very thin and therefore has no volume. I think this product works better for women with thick hair but it’s just too heavy for my hair and makes it look flat. I need something with a little more hold, but if you’re someone who has defined curls, this product will probably be amazing for you.
"

This is my favorite product for styling my fine curly hair. I use two large dollops and a bit of the light deva gel to scrunch when wet and let it air dry. Perfect style every time.  It had really improved the health of my hair to let it go curly and natural more often . Just needed the right product and technique!
"
"
Great price and fast delivery for a product I have used and loved for years — need I say more? I have thin, wavy hair and this adds wonderful texture and volume. I do use a curl enhancer with it, but this goes into the roots to help give the lift I need.
"
"
Keeps my frizzy and curly hair under control without adding extra weight.  Curls stay soft and at the end of the day (or the next morning when I shower), cleans right off with water and doesn't leave my hair in knots!
"
"
I love this product! It helps give my curls shape and form, but is not sticky or overly heavy.  My hair feels light and bouncy.
"
"
AWESOME product for natural curly hair. Been using it for years!
"
"
These is real and quality devacurl product, not a scam. The best price I have ever been able to find for wave maker! I love this styler and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone with wavy/curly hair.
"
"
I have wavy to curly hair and this stuff doesn’t make it curlier but definitely leaves it soft. Works great!
"
"
This product is one of my faves. It smells wonderful, and creates perfect beachy waves.

Love this product!

My daughter has 2a Curls and had a horrible time finding a product that would give her the control and curl definition she wanted without weighing her hair down.  The Deva Curl Line has been AMAZING!!!!  Wish I had known about this sooner!  Keeps her hair healthy and mangaged!  A must have, but should use with additional products.  Her Deva Curl process:1.  B'Leave-in Curl Plumper  2.  Wave Maker  3.  Light Defining Gel** No Hairspray **  No Heat **She's got healthy, happy hair!!!
"
"
Really a great product
"
"
This is one of my favorite products at a great price
"
"
Love it!!!!
"

I have chin to shoulder-length wavy hair and this product creates ringlets and beachy waves really perfectly; it's my favorite of their products along with the styling cream.  It's a bit stiffer than Devacurl's other products, so you have to warm it up in your hands and/or mix it with water, then apply it to sopping wet hair for best results.  The only thing I don't like about it is the smell.  For some reason, each of Devacurl's products has a different scent.  They're all light and usually pleasant, but this one doesn't appeal to me.
"
"
I love this stuff.  I have looked for years for a version of a curl cream that would not feel stiff and separate my big waves.  Curl Maker holds my waves, feels soft and doesn't make it look like it is still wet!  It looks totally natural and soft.
"
"
Always my favorite
"

Worked amazing for my daughters wavy hair.

My naturally curly hair has never, EVER looked better! Soft, touchable curls straight out of the shower with minimal rearranging.Seriously, where has this product been ALL my life? I am including two pics so that you can see what my hair was like before I used the product, and after. In the first picture (taken at the waterfront in Seward, AK) you can see I have natural waves without product. In pics 2 and 3, totally different hair! No perms, root touch-ups b/c I am not ready for the reality that is grey hairs, and an ash-wash to pull out brassiness that happened from our water here in Alaska.I originally bought this from my hair salon, for a good bit more because #overhead and also #Alaska. DēvaCurl your products are the #curlbomb I've been longing for, since I realized I had curly hair (30 years ago!!).Thank you!

I was on a quest for a product that would allow me to wear my hair curly to work. My hair is naturally thick, curly (not ringlets), and frizzy. I saw this product get rave reviews on youtube and decide to test it out. Several youtubers who swear by the curly hair method recommends deva curl products because the ingredients are clean (silicone free, paraben free).How I used it: I washed my hair with shea shampoo and conditioned it with Maui conditioner (both for curly hair). Then while toweling off I applied the product generously to my hair and let it be.Frizz: The frizz is a less with this product compared to most other drug store products on the market (specifically Dove, Garnier, Herbal Essence products). Prior to the Devacurl, I typically used leave in conditioner and moose. Devacurl has  less frizz. Even after 8 hours, the frizz is less than other products on the market.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the frizziest, Devacurl products leave my hair with a frizz level of 5 and most drug store products leave me at a frizz level of 7.Touch: My hair does not feel super soft when I touch it. You can definitely tell there is product in my hair. My hair does not feel stuck either, like when you have cheap gel on.  Somewhere in the middle.Curls: This product will bring out and define your curls. When I don't have product in my hair, my hair is naturally more wavy than curly. This product will bring out my curls even if I don't do much scrunching while I put the product on.Drying: There are several Youtubers who recommend using a diffuser with this product to help speed up the drying process. I usually just let it air dry.  After the shower, drying with a microfiber towel or cotton tshirt can also help minimize the frizz.Weight: My hair does not feel weighed down or lifeless. I would say that it retains volume and bounce.Value: This product does work but it's more expensive compared to other products in the drug store. You get what you pay for. My hair length is about 5 inches below my shoulder. I can wear my hair curly about 10 times per tube.3 stars: I took off one star because although the frizz is less, it's still there. I am still on the quest for the perfect product!

I love this product!! Keeps my curls frizz free and it smells great.
"

Whether your hair is natural curly or permed DevaCurl gives it a very healthy look. It doesn't dry your hair or damage it and makes the curls look awesome.
"
"
I have been using this product for awhile and it helps keep my curl soft. Easy to use, and I'm very happy with this product.
"
"
I got a sample from my stylist a month ago and it fits in nicely with the successful Devacurl line.  Devacurl has been a great product line for me, providing I do the work to keep my hair hydrated. My hair is super curly and it's partially bleached and regularly dyed purple.  Curly hair is naturally very, very, dry, so if you're having trouble, make sure you're using deep conditioning treatments 1-2 times a week.  I let the regular conditioner sit in my hair for nearly my entire shower as well before rinsing most of it out.  I also try to get a salon deep conditioning treatment whenever I get a haircut.Here's how I use this product: take a drop of Heaven In Hair deep conditioning treatment, mix it around in your hands for a while until it turns really white.  Then add a 2-3 pea-sized drop of this Wave-Maker and mix it in with the conditioning treatment, apply to hair and scrunch.  It keeps my hair soft and still defined.If you have trouble with this product, you're probably using too much or your hair is too dry for it to work correctly.  Go to a stylist, get a deep conditioning treatment (Redken has a nice protein treatment for in-salon use only), and try again.
"
"
My hair has a wave to it, but not as much as I'd like and too much for a straight look. This product helps me build some more bounce.
"
"
I love Deva Curl products. I am able to wear my fine curly hair long because these products are so awesome. I especially love the scent of this styling cream. It also is fantastic for my hair.
"
"
My daughter has very curly hair and loves this product. Will buy again.
"
"
I love deva curl wavemaker. It keeps my curls defined and gets rid of the frizz.
"
"
Wonderful!
"
"
Took a while to get here but I love the product!
"
"
After trying several products, I'm so glad I found this one! It has a whipped texture and is VERY lightweight. I have extremely fine hair, and this product leaves perfect light waves that I can still run my fingers through.
"
"
fast shipping; exactly what I ordered; great price!
"
"
Greasy, does the opposite of what it should do even with a little amount. Vegetable Oil is one of the first ingredients. This kills my curls and weighs my hair down
"
"
My hair is very fine and slightly wavy. If I put a tiny (smaller than a dime) amount of this on my hair soaking wet and follow with a bit of mousse, I can use a diffuser and get amazing curls! I like the Quenching Coconut Curls Mousse best - it's light enough to give a bit of hold on my fine hair, while the Diva Curls Mousse is too heavy
"
"
I follow CGM to the letter, but only recently started using Deva Curl products. The summer humidity in Florida is always at least 5000%, and this stuff just doesn't cut it... Even with using an ample amount, I'm still a frizzy mess within minutes of stepping outside. It smells nice and isn't heavy, greasy, or crunchy, so two stars. Maybe it will be good to use during fall or winter, but for now, I'm going back to my huge $2 bottle of LA Looks gel.
"
"
I've used many DevaCurl products and this is one of my favorites. I run a bit of this through my hair while it's still wet in the shower, then dry with a microfiber fleece towel. My hair dries tussled and wavy, and does not feel dry or coarse. Very little frizz or flyaways. I highly recommend for air drying wavy hair.
"
"
Worth the money!!!
"
"
I don't do much with my hair. But I like my curls to actually curl nicely. This is amazing. Leaves my hair soft, and the curls are much less frizzy (I live in Northwest Florida and it's even humid when it's cold here!). Very pleased with this product!
"
"
At first, this product seemed like a dream come true. It smelt pretty good, held my hair in it's luscious curly state, and lasted for up to three days. However, I began to notice severe hair fall that came out in large clumps during my shower. Then I was realizing my hair began to grow brittle and would break off over the slightest tension. Just for the review, it is important to note I do not dye my hair nor do I use any heat styling products or harsh shampoos/conditioners. Everything I use is very natural and health conscious. I took a leap of faith with the Diva Curl Wave Maker (as it is not completely natural) and I could not be more unsatisfied. When I finally boiled down my hair loss to this product I stopped using it and my hair fall stopped within a few weeks. I am so so so sad over losing so much hair and really disappointed as I recently heard Ayesha Malik, the youtube hair guru, has also had serious issues with Diva Curls' products on her hair. Which her and India Batson's reviews for Diva Curl were the only reason's why I trusted the brand in the first place :/ So bummed and really sorry for Ayesha. I want the company to do well, but this was a doozie.
"
"
It's okay.  Doesn't leave my hair crunchy or sticky and it does help the waves but maybe not as much as I had hoped.
"
"
Great product.  A lighter product for super curly hair that gives it definition without heaviness.
"
"
I have gotten this product from my hairdresser and loved it but this was not the same product.  The smell and consistency was different than the original.  I will only but directly through my hairdresser next time.
"
"
I really wanted to like this, but the feeling it left in my hair afterwards was gross! I might have doing it wrong, but it just bothers me. And I also don’t wear much product, so I might not be used to it.

I'm given this a 5* because my hair visible had life and that after pic was 3hr later still not flat. First time use about a dime size and my hair was as damp as should be was actually dry then rewet I have to say so far I really like this for my thin lifeless hair for an all natural look
"
"
I wanted to return this but they won’t take it back and I cannot even find a way to write to the people I bought it from.  The product is awful.  I have used most of the other deva products and love them. This one is terrible. Sticky and adds no wave or body to the hair.  My daughters tried it as well and felt the same way.  I feel like product satisfaction is important.
"
"
You can’t go wrong with diva curl. This wave maker helped define my curls and make them last longer than without this product. I would recommend this smooth wave maker.
"
"
Great product! You don't need much of it to do a good job. I have shoulder length hair and a size of a nickel does the job! Product does not make hair sticky or stiff.
"
"
I have a tighter wave pattern and this doesnt hold my curls tight enough together. Would be great for people with a more loose beachy wave pattern
"
"
I have very temperamental wavy/curly hair, a lot of products weigh it down or make it very frizzy. This product does NOT! My hair is soft and the texture is wonderfully enhanced. I pair it with Aussie frizz-free gel and it works perfect! Buy it here, don’t buy it anywhere else. It is almost 26 bucks on DevaCurl’s site and at Sephora. (East Coast prices)
"
"
I used Deva Curl Wave Maker for several months. Then I noticed my hair had started falling out! I have since found two other people who used this product and had the exact same experience. I stopped using it and slowly I began to lose less hair. Now the problem is almost gone.  I've thrown away the remaining product. I will never buy another Deva product. This stuff is AWFUL. Save your hair; don't buy it!
"
"
I have wavy long hair and this is great for not weighing it down and it gives good texture!
"
"
This made my thick, wavy hair curl nicely but it made me break out pretty bad along my hairline and on my neck. The search continues. I think this is a good product if you don't have sensitive skin and have heavy and wavy hair that needs some control/frizz management. I like that it's a cream instead of a gel, my hair never felt crunchy or sticky with this in it.
"
"
Absolutely love this stuff. I have very thin, fine hair and it actually gives it a bit of  volume and curl without making it crunchy. Will order again and again!
"
"
Gives me fabulous curls sometimes, other times it's a bit too heavy. I think that might have more to do with how often I get it cut, but I've found it's best to use this when it's freshly sheared.
"
"
I purchased this along with the Ultra Defining Hair Gel to use together. I tried the combo 3 times and my hair felt really dried out. So I experimented and stopped using the gel and just used this product alone and I got a nice soft wave with a slight cast and no crunch. Ended up returning the gel because it made my hair feel icky.
"
"
Didn’t do anything to my hair but smells nice. My hair might be too damaged for this type of gel. I would say my hair is wavy more than curly. It defined the waves maybe 25%. I really thought it would make more of a difference considering how much their products cost.
"
"
I was hoping this would enhance my waves but it weighed down my wavy/curly hair. Hated the result even after scrunching it into wet hair. And I didn't even put too much.
"
"
LOVE! I have ""beach"" wavy hair that is heavy and thick and goes flat/straight by end of day without the right product. This stuff keeps my waves, is not sticky, thick, or cakey.
"
"
This product in no way eliminates frizz. If anything, it makes my hair frizzier and less soft than without the product. This brand gets too much hype for mediocre to ineffective products. I’ve had more success with much cheaper brands available in grocery stores.
"
"
Yuck. This product left a greasy film on my hair. On a warm day, the product started to run off of my hair and coat my neck. It did nothing for my curls, either, but made them heavy and almost straight. Very disappointed.
"
"
Absolutely LOVE this product.  I already have natural curly hair it seemed the curls as their own brain. Lol did why THEY wanted to do. I found this product and now my curls mind me. Lol. I’ve had sooo many compliments on my hair. Not sticky at all. Don’t need to use much.
"
"
Pretty good product. Not much control. If you use a lot of it, then layer devacurl gel over it, it works better
"
"
It was lightweight and smells nice, however, it did nothing for my hair. It was more frizzy than if I let it just air dry without anything in it. I was very hopeful when I saw this product, but it was a huge disappointment. I have naturally wavy, fine hair that is very long.
"
"
I agree with the other reviews. So far this is the best product for encouraging frizz free waves that dry soft instead of crunchy.
"
"
this stuff is amazing! it gives me curls that are nice and soft and fluffy looking while also being defined. personally i like to pair with the light defining gel to max definition (just make sure the scrunch out the gel so its not crunchy)
"
"
Pretty disappointed in this product. All the hype for devacurl for a mediocre product. I’ve bought 3 devacurl products and none of them worth it.
"
"
made my hair really greasy and did not help much for my curls but now that I have shorter hair I use to style since its really heavy, but smells amazing
"
"
Feels amazing on my hair. Best product.
"
"
Arrived damaged and says there is no return or replacement. The top seam of the tube ripped and product came out. See photo.
"
"
This doesn't work on my hair type apparently.  It makes my hair feel dry and looks like a birds nest.  Took my waves to stringy and looks horrible.I have low porosity hair and this was recommended but I will have to find another product.
"
"
Does not keep my curls.  Hair goes flat curls don’t look like curls.
"
"
Really like what this product does for my hair.  I have wavy hair and this gives me some great curls.
"
"
This stuff is the absolute best!! Makes your hair feel fantastic too!!
"
"
Forms good curls. No sticky residue. Really nice work.
"
"
Semi-small but the product is good enough that you use very little and it goes a long way. I love the way it smells and doesn’t make my hair hard or sticky like some wave or curl products.
"
"
Love it. Effortless. Doesn't weigh down my hair, gives me nice scrunch waves without feeling hard and krinkly like gel.
"
"
Product does nothing for my hair i have 3b type curls
"
"
This product is amazing for my hair. I have curly/frizzy hair and it makes it more curly and less frizzy. Also, it's recommended by my hairdresser who is very knowledgeable.
"
"
An absolute fav product.
"
"
Great product! Love that it leaves hair soft, not crunchy like mousse. Will definitely purchase again!
"
"
Leaves hair dry and crunchy . And the item is not returnable - I did not bother to read the fine print because who knew there are now items on amazon that can’t be returned even if they are of bad quality
"
"
Newbie to CG method but holy crap!!! I didn’t know my hair could feel so soft with a styler.
"
"
A little thick but when applied to wet hair makes waves really pop!! Do your research!
"
"
Horrible item! Hair loss and itchy scalp! You cant even request a refund and return since it's an eligible for return. What kind of company does this???? Horrible DO NOT PURCHASE!
"
"
excellent product!
"
"
I was looking for a product to help define my curly/wavy hair. This is actually pretty good frizz protection but makes my hair flatter and straighter than it is naturally.
"
"
Really didn’t do much for my hair.
"
"
Didn't work for me, made my hair sticky and heavy, with lesser amount made my hair look dry. Disappointed.The shipping was on time, came intact
"
"
I really love this stuff! Makes my curls defined without being crunchy.
"
"
Doesn’t work.
"
"
good stuff
"
"
its great
"
"
Have had curly/ wavy hair my whole life... tried a million products and this is by far my favorite. Gives me awesome curls, no grease or crunch.
"
"
Don’t like it nothing happens to my heir
"
"
I have wavy 2B/2C hair. This didn't really separate my curls like I wanted for the price. And my hair was still frizzy afterwards. I tried using more product, but it made my hair crunchy.
"
"
Works fine but I don't love the smell of their products. Not sure if it's worth the price.
"
"
I only wish it was more product  for what I payed.
"
"
I could tell a noticable difference in curl of my waves when i used product vs. not using. I will continue to use product.
"
"
Definitely helped enhance my waves without making my hair look greasy. Worked best when I applied it to just barely damp hair
"
"
Does not work
"
"
Excellent product for curly hair!
"
"
I use these products for my curly hair and haven't found anything this good in years. I would highly recommend the entire product line.
"
"
Love my wavemaker! It's a must for anyone with wavy hair
"
"
It is my favorite product for wavy hair!Soft and wavy with no frizz definitely gets 5 stars! You
"
"
Great product for use.
"
"
Product really works. Have been using it for two years and will continue with this product.
"
"
Good product
"
"
How did I ever survive without Devacurl?? This product along with the Lowpoo and One Condition Delight have changed my hair so dramatically I literally still c any believe it. I get compliments on my curls all the time now. My curls are so much more defined, and still touchable. Wavemaker is a cream, not a gel. I apply to sopping wet hair while still in the shower and scrunch with a t shirt. The product is so lightweight it disappears in your hair and you’re left with beautiful defined waves without the crunch or sticky feeling. I can still run my hands through my hair without causing frizz or getting caught up in a bunch of goo. Love LOVE Devacurl!!
"
"
great product
"
"
Not work that well
"
"
nice
"
"
Love thiis stuff! So glad I tried these products
"

Love that it keeps the frizz down.  I also love that it keeps my bouncy.

We love this. Feel free to send samples.

I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It is a literal godsend to my curls type 3!
"
"
The best product for curly hair ever!!
"
"
This stuff is amazing for curly hair!
"
"
One word......AMAZING!!!
"
"
Pretty pricey stuff that didn't do much more than a cheap supermarket product, although I like that my hair wasn't sticky after using it.
"
"
Not a product for everyone.  I have waves, not curls, and fine hair. My waves just became frizzier and less manageable. I even got my hair cut and tried the product again with no success. I like many of the deva products, but it is not a one-size-fits-all thing.  Oh well
"
"
Great product! I've used it a few times now to refresh my curls and it works really well! I have fine, curly hair and I'm really impressed with this stuff.
"
"
It drys my hair and leaves it stringy and super frizzy. My hair is like wavy curly with a lot of volume and I was hoping this would define my curls and make them look super nice. I've heard good things about the product but it really disappointed me so I don't understand. I might have gotten a different formula or something. Not sure but this flopped for me and it's upsetting I can return this.
"
"
Does not feel like the same stuff I bought in the store. It is much more oily and does not hold the curl at all. It doesn't even smell the same.
"
"
I love the feel of this product. Not stiff or sticky. Leaves my waves feeling soft and manageable!
"
"
I am in love with this product.  The light hold is does what no other product can do for my wavy/curly hair.  I just hope they never stop making it!!!!!
"
"
The product works.
"
"
Great new product
"
"
Exactly as advertised, no catch. Awesome product!!
"
"
I L O V E it!
"
"
Love this product!!! Use sparingly and it works wonders!
"
"
Love the light texture and control of the product.
"
"
This product is good for after shower days.
"
"
Makes my hair really wavy and curly! It is worth it!
"
"
I thought this product was going to be light weight and give me more fullness ... my hair was super flat and my hair is pretty dry normally this product made my hair super greasy!!!! Disappointed ! I usually love devachon
"
"
it drys my hair
"
"
I am still finding the right amount for my should length hair to much and it's crunchy to little and it doesn't do anything. I haven't tried with a diffuser so that may make a different I air dry my wavy hair
"
"
Seems to work pretty well and doesn't take much product for my very long, thick hair.  I have very curly hair and this controlled the curl without being crunchy.  I like other Deva Curl products better.  My biggest concern is that you could tell it had been opened and some was missing as the silver seal on the inside was off but someone had attempted to put it back in place. Once they are off they don't go back on.  Although some was missing, I don't think it was that much but very disappointing. I will buy from a store from now on and not Amazon.
"
"
Smells nice. Might be a little too mild for my curls. Probably my mistake.
"
"
I've been using DevaCurl products for many years and as a wavy/curly girl I love the new products that are specifically made for wavy hair. This Wave Maker is awesome although I do find that on more damp days (I live near the beach) and when it's really super dry (SoCal Santa Ana conditions) I have to switch back to my go-to fav combo of Coconut Creme & Light Gel mixed with a little argan/coconut oil to keep my hair from frizzing. So for me this product is weather dependent. Also, I have noticed that if I don't use the exact right amount my hair can feel a little sticky. But overall I love it...so easy to be able to use just one product at least some of the time!
"
"
Doesnt make waves, makes my hair frizzy and look like a bird nest. Even when used with other recommend products like the ultra defining gel.
"
"
Note: I have medium length hair with a medium weight. It tends to be pretty frizzy.I used a bottle with a sprayer on it in place of a shower (my hair tends to retain water really well and takes a while to dry even when loose), to dampen my hair before applying the cream. After working it in, scrunching it, and giving it some time to dry, I ended up with some loose beach wave style curls.The cream has no real noticeable scent once it is on your hair (though initially, it does have a faint, almost citrusy scent when you open the tube). There was a slight change in the texture of my hair but by no means was it 'crunchy'. It still felt light, not oily, or weighed down. My frizz, for the most part, was tamed, though I did have to use some anti-frizz spray closer to my roots where I didn't focus on using the cream as much.

not doing what supose to do , do not buy

I’ve used DevaCurl’s low poo, One Condition, B’Leave In, frizz free foam, and gel with good results, but this is awful. I have fine, high porosity 2b/c waves and thought this might help boost volume. It did provide some texture as promised, but it left a gross residue In my hair and did nowhere near what B’Leave In or the volumizing foam do to fight frizz, and add shine and bounce. I had big, somewhat flat, dirty-feeling hair after this. I’m glad I tried a free sample, because I would be bummed to have paid for this product. If you have wavy hair and want something to help give messy, beachy texture this might work for you, but I’m looking for defined, untangled waves and curl and this is just not it.
"
"
Received from Sephora as a sample. I've tried so many products to let my hair air dry and have beachy waves. This product is perfect for my heavy, medium length hair. Leaves it super soft, not crunchy and wavy/textured. Scrunch when you put it in but don't touch it a lot. It takes my hair 24 hours to air dry and it's even better 2nd day. Often mix with IGK's coconut hair gel too. Nickle sized amount of one or both and go to town. Obsessed!!
"
"
I washed with aveda shampoo for curly hair and used the dermorganic masque.  This product smells sooo GOOD...like skittles but more natural. If I could I’d give it 3 1/2 stars because it does not always leave my hair like this. If I use too much it leaves my hair a  bit sticky and weighed down. It seems that I have to use the right amount in order for it to work. I’ll update later.
"
"
I bought this product without knowing much about it except for the fact that I wanted my cyrls to be fluffy, pronounced and  frizz free and bouncy.  I have a very asymmetrical haircut and the long curls on the left side of my face are very different from the other side . So  this product is totally amazing! I can feel the difference when I touch my hair ...it’s light and  feels like there’s absolutely no product in it and gives it an amazing amount of body. I will always use this product  along with the no Poo shampoo and the delight conditioner my hair has been transformed !!
"
"
My cosmetologist gave me a small packet of Whip It Good Wave Maker - I have short not very curly hair.  I use about a pea size dab spread on my fingers while my hair is wet - no towel drying. It makes the curl and style stay until I wash my hair again.  I just scrunch my hair a little, don't really style or comb it otherwise.  If this is the same product, the best ever.  I never used product in my hair until now.  This stuff has made a believer out of me.  I hope this tube is the same.
"
"
I have fine, wavy 2b hair, and this product is a complete disaster for me. I've tried this alone and with other products, and this always gives me a frizzy, stringy mess. Maybe fine with other people's hair chemistry, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it
"
"
I have curly hair and for some reason I haven’t been able to find that perfect product that doesn’t make my hair sticky, crunchy or blah but I have now!! My hair is awesome and the curls are so bouncy LoVe it!!!!
"
"
A while ago, I received a small bottle of this as a sample from Ulta, I believe. It is amazing stuff. I can truly spend less than 5 mins on my hair and run out the door if I’m in a crunch. When it dries, I have soft waves with little frizz. It’s worth every penny! Sleep on it and it’s even cuter the next day.
"
"
This is fantastic for wavy hair - light enough not to weigh it down.
"
"
I have purchased generic brushes before and they fell apart within days. These have lasted just as long as the  manufacture's expensive toothbrushes at a much lower cost.
"
"
I’m not sure whether it was this product, or the matching deva low-poo & conditioner (or all three) but I’ve never seen my hair this curly!! I’m seeing a ton of definition and A LOT less frizz! I didn’t change my routine at all, just washed, let the condition sit a few minutes, combed with a wide-toothed brush, pressed extra water out with a t-shirt and scrunched this into my hair. This is after one use- I’m excited to see what my hair is like in a few months when this stuff is gone! It smells good too!
"
"
I was very optimistic when I first purchased this product because many people just love this brand.  Unfortunately, this did not work for my hair at all.  It leaves it looking dry and frizzy.  I tried a much cheaper alternative brand, Cantu, and it was a completely different experience.  Love the Cantu products.  I don't think Deva products are bad, but be aware that they will not work for all hair types.  Before you buy it, if you can sample it somehow, it might save you a lot of money.
"
"
I have wavy/curly hair and was excited to try this after reading eviews. However, I couldn't see that it made any difference at all to my hair. I thought maybe I wasn't using it properly, so I asked my Devacurl stylist about it. She doesn't recommend it either. She had high hopes for it, but doesn't see results. Keep your money. I do love One Condition and Arc Angel gel, though.
"
"
Curly hair takes work! I saw the promo video for the product and loved the end result so much I couldn’t help but purchase it. The first time I used it, it wasn’t so successful, it wasn’t until after I followed these steps that I got the result I wanted:Wash with DevaCurl Low-poo (or no-poo, up to you)RinseCondition with DevaCurl (your choice)Run fingers through hair to bind curl patternPart hair (before rinsing)RinseADD PRODUCT TO DRENCHED HAIRDry with Devatoweland air dry of diffuseMy hair looks amazing every time! I use a little bit of spray oil afterwards to tame flyaways, but other than that- no other products are needed and my hair looks even better the next day!
"
"
I have Wavy 2A hair and have been looking for something I can use to do my hair quickly and that will bring out the natural curl. This is the best I've found. I put some on starting about 1/2 way down the length of my hair to the ends, usually when it's still wet, and then I scrunch as my hair dries naturally. It's an easy, quick way to do your hair if you have hair like mine-- s-shaped waves that start around the ear and below.
"
"
I dont really need to write a review about this prpduct.. i think its well known that its amazing. Holds curls SO well and not crunchy and it doednt cause the knots that some styling gels will. Love love love.
"
"
This smells very nice. I have wavy, thin hair (but lots of it) and this is a bit heavy for me. I use a teeny amount. If I use more than about a bean-size amount it tangles my hair and makes it impossible to braid or comb the next day. It’s good to have around for those days when I want to have my hair down and I need to let it air dry.
"
"
I've been a fan of devacurl for a while now. I used to get the Arc gel, and wanted to try out another product from their line. After reading some reviews, I decided to give this a try and it's amazing! Leaves your hair feeling so light, like there's no product in it at all. Doesn't weight the hair down or make it greasy. Definitely buying this again.
"
"
There was so much hyper for this product but it didn't work well for my hair, by itself at least. It actually feels like my hair is being more straightened than wavy. Still trying to test the waters with this for the past two months but so far it's been alright. Interested in trying other deva curl products.
"
"
I absolutely love it. I'm starting my curly girl journey and I'm a month in and I kept hearing good things about this product and got it. When i tried it, my waves had more definition and smelled good lol. I used this product with the defining gel and it worked so well!
"
"
My wavy hair loveees this. Always helps me get definition without making my hair feel tacky. Note: A little product goes a long way.
"
"
I have really long wavy hair.  I was hoping this would boost my curls.  It does not.  It weighs it down more and makes it flat.  I probably just have the wrong hair type for it.  I will not be buying anymore of these products.
"
"
This is a great Deva product if you have curly hair it is a must
"
"
Amazing!! My curl has never looked better and completely frizz free.
"
"
Apply on wet hair.. do not use towel to dry hair, comb with fingers and let it air dry.. works wonders.
"
"
This product made my hair fall out, damaged my curl pattern and gave me a itchy, flaky scalp. It was great the first 2-3 times I used it then I lost half of my hair in the front. I would advise against anyone using it. I don’t want this to happen to one more person.
"
"
This stuff works great. Very nice for scrunching wet hair. A great alternative to gel products.
"
"
My favorite curl product!!
"
"
This product really enhances my curls.  My hair stylist first introduced me to it and I am hooked!  There is no frizziness, my curls look better and they last all day.
"
"
My daughter has thick, wavy hair and we have tried everything. Nothing defines her waves more than this product. She is a fan for life, and I am just grateful to stop searching. Fantastic and highly recommended.
"
"
Love this product! Its definitely helped with making my curls/waves bigger and smoother. Its not a huge bottle though, and I personally end up using a fair amount of product, so it can get a bit more expensive than some other drug-store products. For me, its worth the price!
"
"
It didn't really help my wavy, frizzy hair. Was hoping I'd gain more manageable curls but didn't work on my hair.
"
"
LOVE this best product iv had
"
"
Doesn't do much for my short wavy hair but I prefer it over gel and mousse. Maybe it works best when using the DevaCurl blow dryer. I would like to find a product that works by just applying it to wet or dry hair without all the extra details.
"
"
If you have wavy or curly hair and you want to create/maintain the latest styles, this stuff is magic!  I highly recommend it.  You only need a small amount, and you get great results.
"
"
Excellent product - does not weigh your hair down or make it feel sticky.
"
"
Works great on my 2b wavy hair!  The feel is light and textured, but not sticky. Not a big fan of the scent, but it fades.  Used with a deva towel and a good squish, and it keeps curls together well!
"
"
I didn't really care for this product because it did not give me the curl I was wanting and I don't like the feel the product gives your hair when you put it in.
"
"
Great for my curls but can leave buildup
"
"
Total control without weighting my hair down.
"
"
Best hair EVER!!! My hair never frizzes and looks naturally beachy with this amazing stuff. Plus, you only need a little bit. Smells great.
"
"
It's nicer than some of the other products out there but I'm still not completely in love with this brand.
"
"
Great product....love the texture of product. will buy again!
"
"
I have fine, swavy hair, and this is my favorite styling product for creating loose curls.
"
"
I have very low wave hair. I was using deva curl one condition followed by the ultra hold gel. But I only need this product. I use no poo, I don't condition even if hair feels rough. I then scrunch out all the water and comb this product through with my fingers, removing any tangles and coating my hair. I then scrunch with my fingers, again with a towel and it gives soft beautiful waves. Pretty good.
"
"
Doesn't to the job I was hoping and leave my hear feeling like it has a ton of product in it at the end of the day! Doesn't add the definition that I was hoping for I have curly/wavy hair
"
"
Works ok
"
"
This is the miracle of curls
"
"
Work wonders in my hair and really helps taming down the frizz and just lets the curl stay.
"
"
Gentle to my hair, leaves my waves soft & not crunchy.
"
"
Loved it. Made my waves look so good and so soft
"
"
Thank you for fast shipping.  Great product!
"
"
This doesn't work for me. I have wavy/loose curls and it seems to heavy for my hair....it pulls my waves out making them straighter than I want. I feel like this product is a bit greasy feeling as well.
"
"
Loved it.  It make my hair soft and easier to comb through.
"
"
Recently had my hair dresser use this on me and I wanted it! My hair was soft, not frizzy and so shiny! Perfect for fine wavy hair that needs some protection from the elements.
"
"
works well
"
"
Works good but kinda heavy.
"
"
Perfect!
"
"
Love it!
"
"
works great!!
"
"
Best stuff ever!
"
"
I don't like the buildup.
"
"
Did not receive correct item and item was leaking
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Love this product!!! Works great with a diffuser and also applied at night to sleep in.
"
"
My Deva stylist used Wave Maker on me two weeks ago during my last hair cut and I LOVED it! It smells great and adds some more pep to my waves which can be easily lost when using the Deva Gels. I use a cocktail of the Light Gel and Ultra Gel. Now I've added Wave Maker to my routine.I apply it to my hair after I've shaken out some of the water. Use about a 1 inch dollop of the product, rub it into both hands and apply to your waves. For application, I don't apply it like I do the gels. I smooth Wave Maker gently over my waves and since I have thick hair i'll lift up some of it to get underneath the top layer of my hair for even distribution. I also like to use a little bit extra on the crown of my head so that I can get more volume when using clips.Then I apply a cocktail of the Light Defining Gel and Ultra Defining Gel (equal amounts of each) in the typical fashion.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Not sticky but holds great
"
"
I absolutely love this cream. It doesn't weigh my hair down or make it greasy, and it smells lovely! It creates soft, natural wave definition. And the best part is that you only need to use a little bit each time, so the product lasts and is well worth the price!
"
"
Left a film on my hair and made it very dry. I didn't see any benefit. I've used many Deva products before. I'm not sure if the formularies are changing, or my hair just isn't taking to the products anymore, but I'm about ready to change to something else completely. Evidently this seller didn't accept returns.
"
"
I have been buying Deva products for almost 15 years and very few have been disappointing.  This curl enhancer is great.  It doesn't leave my curls crunchy like the Deva Angel gel.  Smells nice too.
"
"
Product smells nice, but doesn't work any miracles on my fine hair. I like to scrunch and air dry, but this product tends to make my hair greasy/weighed down before the end of the day.
"
"
Not impressed. Love DevaCurl, but this did not work for my fine, wavy hair. Upset that the seller does not accept returns. Do not recommend.
"
"
Although I absolutely love Deva Curl Products, this was an eh for me. My hair is very fine and it's a bit light at the crown, this sort of weighed my hair down. If you're looking for gorgeous girls, definitely try the DevaCurl Gel (light hold). You will thank me!
"
"
I have a love/hate relationship with Deva products.  I have fine, 2C hair, and the various gels can make my hair feel too gummy and tacky.  I go to a stylist who just cuts curly and wavy hair using the Deva Cut method, and she used it on me.  I loved how my hair turned out so much that I bought a tube.My stylist's assistant said that this product should be used after squeezing out some of the water in your hair (unless like many of the other Deva products, which should be applied to soaking wet hair).  Following her instructions, I spread about an 1"" of this on my finger (I'm growing out a short cut, and the back of my hair is just at my shoulders), smoothed it through my hands, and then leaned over and applied to the right side of my hair, and then scrunched it in.  I then have been doing the same on the left side.  I also put a light coating over the first three or so inches of my hair; I have to be careful not to use too much there or it makes my hair look greasy.  I've also been following it with either Deva Arc Angel or Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee, and then clipping to dry.While you can definitely feel the product in your hair, it's not too tacky-feeling.  I really like this so far!
"
"
My curls are so soft and not frizzy!
"
"
Love it!!!!!!
"
"
The best thing after years using styling cream + angell. This is a new product and really makes what it promises: it feels like there’s nothing in your hair at all!
"
"
Really helped define my waves with close to zero frizz. For my hair, that's worth celebrating. I purchased the styling cream too and I used that first, then the wave maker followed by a bit of gel and A LOT of scrunching. I'm very impressed with the results! I recommend finishing with a diffuser. These two products from devacurl are my new go-to for a flawless wash-n-go which has been elusive for me until now.
"
"
Had to return it for the perfume smell - it about knocked me over before I even took it out of the box.  This might not be a problem for some but I am sensitive so it had to go back without even trying it!
"
"
I have hair that tends to wave in random, awkward places if it doesn't have help.This. Didn't work. At ALL. And couldn't return it.Try something else.
"
"
I ordered this product, along with the Ultimate Defining Gel, the No-Poo Cleanser, and the One Condition, after my salon gave me a sample kit to try. I have to say, this is the first time that I've actually been confident in my hair and the amount of time and stress that it saves me in the morning is invaluable. This morning, for the first time I used the gel and the texture whip after washing and conditioning my hair with a different shampoo and conditioner, and they still worked great, so don't let it hold you back if you can't or don't want to buy a whole set of Devacurl products.It's pricey, and being someone who has never paid a lot for hair products it was hard to lay down this much cash for one item. But as other reviewers point out, you don't need to use a lot and a little goes a long way. Plus, the peace of mind really is worth a lot in the end. Highly recommend!
"
"
If you like stringy looking hair, then you will like this. Wave Maker is a mousse and it does what mousses do... make hair look stringy.Its usually the fine haired people who use mousses because they are light weight. I can always spot a person who uses mousse...their hair looks pathetically stringy.  I used it this morning and was drying my hair and it was looking more and more stringy. So, I had get back into the showerand start over. My favorite for my fine wavy curly hair is b'leave in and ultra defining gel. Then I get clumpy curls. Much better.
"
"
Until I found Deva Curl, my menopausal hair was a frizzed mess (never had curly hair before).  Wavemaker has turned out to be my all time favorite styling product.  For those who have given it poor reviews, it may not be the correct product for you, or it may be that you aren't applying it correctly. There really is an art to this stuff if you read the book (Curly Girl)  or go to the Deva Curl website.But the best advice I can give you is to suggest you see a stylist who is trained by Deva Curl to cut curly hair-- by far the best cut my curly/wavy hair has ever had.  That person can show you how to apply the product, and which product is best for your hair.
"
"
I love this product! It is unique and different and gives amazing results to your wavy hair.
"
"
Smells amazing but it’s a little too lightweight for my hair. I’d like something a little bit more conditioning maybe with more hold
"
"
I received a sample from my hairdresser...and WOW! A little goes a long way. I've been using Deva Curl products for about 5 years now..and although I do love their products...I've struggled to find a good balance for a styling creme/gel. My hair is very fine and thin...so generally speaking its hard to find a product (even when using a tiny bit) that doesn't weigh my hair down, or leave some frizz behind. I have finally found the perfect styling product in Wave Maker. This gave me tons of volume and no frizz. I've found their Delight line has worked great for me as well.
"
"
Leaves hair dry and crunchy.
"
"
absolutely love this product! hands down my favorite to use with my curly hair!!
"
"
A few years ago I had gotten a Deva curl cut and purchased products from a salon. I loved what products did for my hair. I've grown up with curly frizzy hair that's not very coarse but also not very manageable. This gel provides just enough hold for my curls to look great without making my hair super crunchy. The first time I used it I think I used too much but I was able to break apart the curls and they looked great. Having had time to play around with the ratio I've been able to achieve a look that seems effortless. I literally wash my hair with regular shampoo then flip and condition with my hair upside down and after conditioning I scrunch the gel into my hair while it's still soaking wet and upside down. This method seems to work best for me but I also have long hair. Where I live there is not much humidity but it gets extremely hot and even with sweating my hair hasn't frizzed back up and the gel integrity was not compromised. This is a great price for this product, in the salon I paid almost double for a smaller bottle. Will purchase again!
"
"
I am a huge fan of DevaCurl products. I have been using DevaCurl for over a year now. It works well for both my long hair and short hair.I started with their travel size of the ""DevaCurl Kit for All Curl Kind"" It includes 3oz bottles of  No-Poo Original, One Condition Original, Styling Cream, Light Defining Gel.I was really shocked at how well this line of products worked on my hair. I buy all of them in the large bottles now. Individually they are good products but together they have changed my curls. I am not kidding at all! My curls are curlier, not crunch, not as frizzy and overall more beautiful than before I used DevaCurl.I have bought this travel sized pack for multiple curly haired friends to try because I know if you just try all the products together you will be sold!
"
"
I've been using this gel for years as my go-to hair product. With this most recent purchase, after using it, I noticed my hair looked as if...well, as if I hadn't even showered! I thought, maybe I forgot to apply it...? Next time I showered, I used it again...and it looked like I hadn't used any product at all. Complete frizz. I checked the ingredient list in comparison to my empty bottle and...sure enough, some of the ingredients have changed! This gel does not work any more for my hair. I guess I'll try their other gel, but why, WHY did they have to go and change this formula? Sad!
"
"
Hair just finished drying, and I just finished the last step in the directions listed on the product bottle... I am still in disbelief.I spontaneously decided to DIY perm my naturally pin-straight Asian hair last week and since have been realizing i am so unprepared to manage curly hair. I bought some cult favorite products (Curl Smoothie, Pantene Curl Gel, etc) before landing on this gel by Devacurl, and none of the others defined and tamed my hair like this. I was convinced that i didn’t properly set some strands of my perm and that they were just going to be demaged and straight. After using this light gel and following the directions (apply evenly to soaking hair, scrunch with a microfiber towel, dry without touching (!!), then upward scrunch the crunchiness away for soft curls. Did all of the following and i can see every wave and Curl i set in my home perm, giving me back hope that i didn’t totally screw up my hair.TBH i used devacurl last bc i thought it would only work on natural curls and bc it’s a salon product and harder to get than drugstore products. I was totallllyyytt wrong and think this is better for artificial curls more than anything!Totally obsessed, i want to marry it.
"
"
I hated my curly hair, it would always just turn to fluff within a couple hours of styling. I mean fluffy to the point people would attempt to pet my head. After trying the deva curl product I’m learning to embrace my curls. They are defined and soft, full of movement. I get compliments all the time now, and I’m feeling better about wearing my natural curves. I previously used Shae Moisture, but my curls weren’t nearly as defined. Make sure you leave some of their conditioner in, squeeze the water out of your hair, blot with a microfiber towel then add enough gel that when your hair dries it’s crunchy. Once completely dry scrunch out the product. You are left with soft defined hair all day.Downside: takes forever to dry. Get a diffuser and set aside sometime.
"
"
I love all Devacurl products. They have really changed my hair for the best. This gel locks in moisture, hydrates hair, and controls frizz while also leaving my hair soft. NO CRUNCHY tecture.
"
"
Absoluletly nothing better for your curly hair than Deva Curl products. I use them all and my curls have never looked better! For years I hated my curly hair. It was frizzy, dried out and impossible to work with. I had tried everything out there than said it was for curly hair and I never got the results I wanted with any other product. Deva Curl has made me love and embrace my curls. I now get stopped on the street by people telling me how much they love my curls and how pretty my hair is. Even my hairdresser has become a believer and is using Deva Curl with all her curly haired clients.
"

Love this product.  I've used numerous curl products throughout my life (including Eufora and Bumble & Bumble) and this is my favorite as far as results.  It creates a defined curl without the ""crispiness"" that some products create.  My ONLY complaint about this line of products is with the smell.  Its not a fragrance that I like, or can even place.  Whereas the Bumble and Bumble is vaguely floral and soft smelling, this is more anise(?) smelling.

The product worked well for the most part.  The front/sides of my hair had a soft curl, the back however was frizzy.  Not crazy about the scent, but it went away after hair dried.  I have very thick hair that has curly, wavy & straight sections.  Drying it naturally took several hours, so this is not something I can use if I need to be somewhere early.  When my hair dried, it still looked somewhat wet and “crunchy”.  Fingering it out softened if it but also pulled some curl out & increased frizz.  I’ll defin use again... hoping it will get better with practice 🤗.  Price is great as I saw this in a salon and it was twice as expensive.

I used this in combinations with Deva curl No-poo cleanser and one conditioner. I love the shampoo and conditioner (doesn't dry out my hair) but I think adding this light gel helps define my curls. I leave my hair wrapped in a towel for around 10 minutes after showering and then use about a quarter size amount of gel, crunching my hair as I work it in. Once my hair is dry, there is no gel residue. I also put in a little bit of matrix biolage hydra-seal leave in cream (after my hair dries) because it helps smooth the little bit of frizz that's left. Before using Deva curl products my hair was questionably wavy. It would be straight in certain areas and wavy/kinky in others. Now I have soft waves throughout. Love, love, love this product line. As far as how long it will last- I shower every other day, have had this since January and still have 3/4 of a bottle left. Smells great too!

A few years ago I had gotten a Deva curl cut and purchased products from a salon. I loved what products did for my hair. I've grown up with curly frizzy hair that's not very coarse but also not very manageable. This gel provides just enough hold for my curls to look great without making my hair super crunchy. The first time I used it I think I used too much but I was able to break apart the curls and they looked great. Having had time to play around with the ratio I've been able to achieve a look that seems effortless. I literally wash my hair with regular shampoo then flip and condition with my hair upside down and after conditioning I scrunch the gel into my hair while it's still soaking wet and upside down. This method seems to work best for me but I also have long hair. Where I live there is not much humidity but it gets extremely hot and even with sweating my hair hasn't frizzed back up and the gel integrity was not compromised. This is a great price for this product, in the salon I paid almost double for a smaller bottle. Will purchase again!

I am a huge fan of DevaCurl products. I have been using DevaCurl for over a year now. It works well for both my long hair and short hair.I started with their travel size of the ""DevaCurl Kit for All Curl Kind"" It includes 3oz bottles of  No-Poo Original, One Condition Original, Styling Cream, Light Defining Gel.I was really shocked at how well this line of products worked on my hair. I buy all of them in the large bottles now. Individually they are good products but together they have changed my curls. I am not kidding at all! My curls are curlier, not crunch, not as frizzy and overall more beautiful than before I used DevaCurl.I have bought this travel sized pack for multiple curly haired friends to try because I know if you just try all the products together you will be sold!
"
"
I've been using this gel for years as my go-to hair product. With this most recent purchase, after using it, I noticed my hair looked as if...well, as if I hadn't even showered! I thought, maybe I forgot to apply it...? Next time I showered, I used it again...and it looked like I hadn't used any product at all. Complete frizz. I checked the ingredient list in comparison to my empty bottle and...sure enough, some of the ingredients have changed! This gel does not work any more for my hair. I guess I'll try their other gel, but why, WHY did they have to go and change this formula? Sad!
"
"
Hair just finished drying, and I just finished the last step in the directions listed on the product bottle... I am still in disbelief.I spontaneously decided to DIY perm my naturally pin-straight Asian hair last week and since have been realizing i am so unprepared to manage curly hair. I bought some cult favorite products (Curl Smoothie, Pantene Curl Gel, etc) before landing on this gel by Devacurl, and none of the others defined and tamed my hair like this. I was convinced that i didn’t properly set some strands of my perm and that they were just going to be demaged and straight. After using this light gel and following the directions (apply evenly to soaking hair, scrunch with a microfiber towel, dry without touching (!!), then upward scrunch the crunchiness away for soft curls. Did all of the following and i can see every wave and Curl i set in my home perm, giving me back hope that i didn’t totally screw up my hair.TBH i used devacurl last bc i thought it would only work on natural curls and bc it’s a salon product and harder to get than drugstore products. I was totallllyyytt wrong and think this is better for artificial curls more than anything!Totally obsessed, i want to marry it.

I hated my curly hair, it would always just turn to fluff within a couple hours of styling. I mean fluffy to the point people would attempt to pet my head. After trying the deva curl product I’m learning to embrace my curls. They are defined and soft, full of movement. I get compliments all the time now, and I’m feeling better about wearing my natural curves. I previously used Shae Moisture, but my curls weren’t nearly as defined. Make sure you leave some of their conditioner in, squeeze the water out of your hair, blot with a microfiber towel then add enough gel that when your hair dries it’s crunchy. Once completely dry scrunch out the product. You are left with soft defined hair all day.Downside: takes forever to dry. Get a diffuser and set aside sometime.
"
"
I love all Devacurl products. They have really changed my hair for the best. This gel locks in moisture, hydrates hair, and controls frizz while also leaving my hair soft. NO CRUNCHY tecture.
"
"
Absoluletly nothing better for your curly hair than Deva Curl products. I use them all and my curls have never looked better! For years I hated my curly hair. It was frizzy, dried out and impossible to work with. I had tried everything out there than said it was for curly hair and I never got the results I wanted with any other product. Deva Curl has made me love and embrace my curls. I now get stopped on the street by people telling me how much they love my curls and how pretty my hair is. Even my hairdresser has become a believer and is using Deva Curl with all her curly haired clients.

Still working with this to define my curls. I've been straightening my hair regularly for about 2 years. I am now working on my curls so I'm not the greatest at a good technique. This gel does crunch a lot for me and gets a bit heavy weighing down the curl. I'm using a blow dryer with the curl extension. As I get better with my technique, I would probably be able to have similar results out of this gel than others here. I still think the texture of this gel is very good compare to how other gels feel when you're rubbing it in your hands before applying.
"
"
I have been using deva curl light defining gel for 5 years now and purchased my bottle from amazon to save a little money but this product is not actual deva curl brand. Smells different and my hair is very cery frizzy. NOT SCTUAL FEVA CURL PRODUCT.
"
"
Best product I have ever used and I have super thick curly hair, for the price it is a STEAL. That being said... It arrived with he cap hardly screwed on and product all over the bottle and in the bag containing the bottle and all over the box containing the bag.. I don't know if that's the shipping companys fault or if it's just not taking pride in manufacturing or just a simple mistake..so that was a little disappointing but beside that little blip it is an amazing product and worth every cent. Would recommend.
"

I have naturally wavy hair that I leave natural. This product is nice to have around but I won't be incorporating it into my daily routine. I can achieve the same texture and hold by scrunching and putting my hair in a loose bun on top of my head for 20 mins. It made me feel like I needed to wash my hair every day and I can't do that with how dry my hair tends to be.
"
"
My first time using a devacurl product. i like the light hold and my hair doesn’t have those crispy curls after using gel. attached is a picture (my hair is completely dry in the pic) from a humid summer day in northern va and curls are pretty frizz free.  on wet hair i use i.c.o.n. mesh moisturizing styling cream and then add the devacurl light gel. I love the i.c.o.n. mesh, but need a little extra something to prevent frizz.  i’m not crazy for the scent of this gel - i’m not into fruity smells for hair products. also the product is a tad pricey for the amount you get. overall good first experience with devacurl product.  my hair is naturally wavy/curly.
"

I've been doing Curly Girl for about 3 months now, and just started using this product again.  I didn't like it at first, but I love it now! Maybe my hair was rebelling against the new routine at first (they say that can happen), I don't know, but this gel leaves my hair really, really well defined, yet soft, springy, and voluminous all day long.  My hair is just slightly longer than shoulder length and I only use about a golf ball size glob, total.  I apply it in smaller globs, not all at once.  I also use Curl Keeper (smoothed over like leave-in) before the Angel.  They work really nicely together, imo.I've experimented a lot with different gels and products in the few months I've been doing CG, and nothing seems to nourish my hair, while still giving me a consistently good hair day, quite like this gel. Kinky Curly Curling Custard is the only thing that came close, but I didn't like how soft that left my hair.  I need something with a little texture so my hair doesn't fall flat (I have really fine 3B curls), but not so much crunch that I'm a stringy mess.  The Deva Angel does the trick for me on both accounts.  All I have to do to get a little volume back in throughout the day is rub my roots with my finger tips a little, and poof, I'm back to where I started when I left the house!  I'm so glad I gave this gel a second chance.  I use it in conjunction with the Deva One Conditioner, which I also really like and keep coming back to (even though I keep trying new products).This gel might seem expensive, but I think the quality is well worth it.  I definitely started out thinking products in this price bracket were a splurge, but I'm finding more and more that you really get what you pay for with the Deva products and their natural ingredients.Overall, I highly recommend this product.
"
"
I HATE IT. It is not a real devacurl product, or if it is it's absolute trash. It leaves my hair super stiff and cumply and it just looks like it's oily and dirty. i ahte it so much but the return policy is trash
"
"
I have 3c-4a curls and wanted to give Devacurl a try after hearing other Devacurl product reviews. However, this is NOT the gel for you if you are actually trying to get a ""gelled"" look or replace a medium-hold gel. It is truly a light-hold gel and really did not seem to gave an effect on my hair. Also, it does not mix well with other products. I use Cantu-Leave in Conditioner (which I have loved for years) and combining it with this product caused the conditioner to curdle in my hair (best way to describe it). I also have long hair and felt like I had to use a ton of gel to style my hair. Overall, save your money and try something like TGIN's moisturizing gel.
"

I have used Deva Curl off and on since 2001. I used to love it. However, something changed in the product when the company has been sold. The products have caused me general hair loss for a few years, and this product in particular has caused me more severe hair loss, particularly in the areas I would use this daily to refresh. Don’t use Deva Curl.After discovering that this may be the reason for my hair loss, I discovered a Facebook group with over 3400 people who have hair loss, scalp issues, and hair breakage all from Deva Curl. I am most definitely not alone.I know it’s Deva Curl because when I stopped the products completely and shampooed with a shampoo with sulfates, the next showers only had a half of the amount of hair loss I had previously been used to.
"
"
I have heavy thick hair that wants to curl, but without product, drops to wavy as it dries. Most curl products don't hold well enough for all day curls. I first bought DevaCurl light defining as a lark because it was on a great sale at a salon. It's the best product I've ever owned. I've used it nearly every day for over a year. I very rarely even blow dry and iron my hair straight anymore, which used to be my standard, to avoid the crazy waves. With DevaCurl, I just wet my hair in the shower in the morning, rub the product onto my hair and scrunch the curls, then let it dry, and I have all day curls. It's so much healthier for my hair than the heat, and doesn't dry it out.
"
"
Works well for my hair. I have pretty frizzy curls and this helps to keep them under control. Put it on after you have gotten out of the shower, but your hair is still wet.
"
"
I've tried it all and this is the best curly hair product! Rub it in while my hair is still wet and I'm pretty much good to go. While it's not ""crunch free"" like it claims it's by far the least crunchy for the most frizz control. My hair is usually more from then curls but this gel really brought out the curls and the friz is all but gone. Can't recommend enough. I do find myself using a nickel to quarter size amount but I have lots of thick hair that's shoulder length.

Bought this and other DEVA CURL products for my mom who has permed hair. Was visiting her over the holidays, and decided to try it out on my long straight hair. Though my typical Asian hair would not be considered curly (or wavy) by any real curly haired gal, my hair is wavy when it is wet, air dries frizzy, blow dries and brushes out straight, and my dad has wavy-ish hair that has gotten kinky/frizzy as he ages. I thought I could use this product to exploit what waves I have...and it really does work! I didn't use the DEVA shampoo or conditioner, but I followed their techniques (I used this video tutorial on Youtube: Set Your Curls Free For 2011 by WSALONVA)- no wringing or twisting hair during washing/drying, must flip hair over face to dry, scrunching to remove water, and scrunching to apply gel, and using a diffuser on the hairdryer to ""scrunch"" dry.  Because my hair is so long and prone to knots, I made sure to brush my hair prior to washing, so as not to disturb my hard-won waves. But flipping the hair over, scrunching to dry and apply gel really worked wonders! Even for the amount of hair I had, a little quarter sized squirt was all I needed. My hair dried with big bouncy waves that looked like my hair was blown out, and it was soft and shiny without looking product loaded. AMAAAAAZINNNG! And it looked so good the next day that I didn't even have to style my hair. I was unable to replicate the same results with a drugstore brand gel. Unable to say if one could replicate this with a similar salon quality product from another company, but I'm happy not to have to look further. This Amazon price is quite reasonable, and as long as this price is available, I will happily purchase this product. To sum it up: This product really feels and looks natural, while maintaining body.  So if you're a *straight* hair peep- try this. But make sure you use it the correct way.

Love this product for my curly hair! It is one of the many devacurl products I use for my hair. It doesn’t leave my hair feeling crunchy or greasy. Must have for curly hair
"
"
Deva Curl has saved my liiiife when it comes to my hair. My curls were in quite a funk for a while and DevaCurl has changed that for me. I have super coarse/dry curls so this gel is great for me bc it doesn’t dry them out. A little goes a longgg way- especially if you don’t want that stiff, overdefined look. I recommend the Deva Curl curl cream as a base, but the gel is amazing on its own too.
"
"
 I love deva curl !! And I typically order it from amazon. I don't usually have any problems but this time, from this seller the gel that I received was pretty watered down. very frustrating...!!
"
"
I have loose-ringlet curly hair. This gel is fantastic. It’s light and doesn’t leave your hair crunchy and stiff, but does control the frizz and organize the curls into nice spirals. Leaves your hair big and full without being a frizzy mess. Stays great all day, and I live in super-humid Texas, so that’s a miracle!
"
"
Amazon didn't accept my 1st review for some reason so I. Keeping this one short. This gel works perfect at locking in my curls without over crunching it.
"
"
Good for my curly hair, the stronger hold stuff was horrible and crunchy. But I can spend less on an Aussie light hold gel and it does the same thing. The scent isn't my favorite, but not bad.
"
"
Pretty disappointing. I saw a girl at a taco place who had the most controlled, beautiful curls I've ever seen. I asked her what product she used, she said ""DevaCurl!"" Now, perhaps I bought the wrong DevaCurl product but this was no better than the 1.00 LA Looks Gel my older brother used way too much of in the 90s. I thought it would tame my wild frizzies toward the top of my head, but no, just exaggerated them. I admit, sometimes, under the perfect amount of not disturbing my hair at all, it will define waves well toward the bottom half of my hair. And for that, I give it more than one star.
"
"
I've been using this for years and LOVE it. It used to be called An-gel but is now called Light Defining Gel. Same great product. Will continue to use it as long as they continue to make it!
"
"
Ok, so I have struggled with styling my curls for years, I usually straighten my hair because my hair tangles and breaks much more when curly. I have a weird combination of fine curly spirals that get super dry in the back. I started using this product with a teeny bit of Argon oil (just on my ends) and a diffuser. I have never had such soft touchable curls in my life!!! I did have to play around with the amount and methods of drying... i.e. microfiber towel/t-shirt dry first vs. towel to scrunch out excess product... before I really began to like it. There is also the trial/travel pack which has their No Poo, One Condition, and Set it Free in addition to the gel available if you want to try before you buy the big bottle ;)
"
"
My hair is very curly but fine, so I stick with light hold gels typically.  Using this product actually makes my hair worse....frizzy and overly soft and unruly. I threw it away after many attempts to make it work. It does not define my curl at all. After using this my hair looks like it does when it's been overly touched and combed or brushed, which means I resemble a fuzzy poodle.
"
"
I tried the ultra gel, which I hated, so I figured maybe this would be better. I don't like this one either - it leaves my hair feeling icky. Every time I try another gel I keep going back to the Ouidad Climate Control gel, which I like the best. The Ouidad makes my hair a bit crunchy, which is good for making the curls defined and non-frizzy, and then I can squish the crunch out and soften it a bit, leaving my hair feeling normal. The Deva gel leaves this gross ickiness in my hair, like it's dirty and sticky.
"
"
I already had a huge bottle of gel, but I got excited when I saw this on amazon so I ordered more. I bought this thinking it was the old formula (the green label with the white swirl shown in the item picture), but the item I received is the new packaging. Devacurl must have changed the gel ever so slightly because my hair doesn’t love the new gel as much - it leaves my hair kind of weighted down and stringy, but I’ve been using it because I haven’t found another that I liked better. I gave it three stars because it’s “eh.” The shipping was quick and the item was packaged well. I’m just bummed to have paid $30 thinking I was getting one thing, only to receive another (especially when I already had a full bottle of the new gel).
"
"
The gel smells like Deva Curl but it separates in the bottle like it is either too watery or it’s really old. (See photo) It makes my hair feel terrible. Nothing like I’m used to with h this brand. I bought a new one from my salon and now I can really see the difference. I thought this would be a great money saver, but there’s a reason these are cheaper here.
"
"
Love, love, love!  Turns my frizzy wavy/curly hair into beautiful, defined - but not crunchy! - ringlets.  If you use too much it can give a ""wet"" look, so experiment a bit to find the right amount for you.  My hair is shoulder length and fine textured; I use an amount the size of a nickel.
"
"
I love it!! It defined my curls very nicely, I got comments on my hair because of how pretty the curls looked. And it smells really good too, it has a fresh scent to it. And it helps control frizz as well. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with curly hair.
"
"
Love the DevaCurl products. I usually buy the ultra defining gel but switched to the light defining gel during the winter months. I find I don’t need as much hold in the winter since there is less humidity here. It works really well. Very lightweight gel so it doesn’t pull down my curls as much.
"
"
I actually like this better than the heavier defining gel. I have 2b curls, so this works great for that type. Makes for a very soft curl. My sister has 3c and this would do nothing for her hair.
"
"
This didn't work at all for my 3a/b curls.It left my hair dry & frizzy.  The scent is very overpowering.All in all, a total waste.  I ended up throwing this product in the trash.
"
"
Really works great-I am in the process of trying to grow out my hair and bring it back to life after years of coloring/bleaching so I'm doing my best to avoid all types of heat. With this I just run a quarter (or a little more) through my hair and scrunch up with a dry clean t-shirt. It doesn't get clumpy or hard like typical gel.  After my hair air dries it's still soft & loose curls
"
"
I don’t like for my hair to be crunchy when it’s dried and down, and this one give me good hold without the crunch like the arc angel gel from Deva. I can still get the occasional frizz, but I’m very happy with how this product makes my hair feel (type 3B curls)
"
"
This gel never disappoints. I have thick curly hair and I don't like heavy product of hard hold. This smells nice and really holds shine and curl pattern for days at a time.
"
"
I have curly hair, and I've searched for years for the perfect product to control it. This is the winner! I've tried about 30 different products, and this is by far the best. Holds the curls in place, but doesn't feel crunchy.
"
"
I know this sounds like hyperbole, but this gel has literally improved my life for the better. With thick curly hair, I am always worried about frizz. This gel does a great job at managing the frizz and encouraging more defined curls. Once I just scrunch up my hair a few times, the stiffness immediately breaks and my hair feels soft. Also, it smells good. I kind of think it smells like apples. This bottle is definitely a good value, compared to other sellers or sizes.
"
"
I have wavy hair and love this hair gel. It gives your hair a natural look while taming fly away hair strands. It does not give you that wet crunchy look which I prefer not to have. I would definitely recommend this product.
"
"
The product is fine.  The packaging, however, is poorly done.  After I received my first order, I reached into the box to pull out the bottle, and the top came off in my hand.  Amazon was very efficient about sending a replacement . . . but it, too, arrived with the top loose and content seeping out.  I have ordered this same item from other places in the past and have had no problem because they tightened the top and it to the bottle with strong tape (strapping tape, moving tape).
"
"
Product is like water. It doesn’t hold curls. The gel is also completely useless in controlling frizz. I’ve been trying to return this item for weeks and haven’t heard from the seller. Don’t waste your money.
"
"
My hair is 2A. This took all the curl out of my hair. Really weird. Don’t know if it’s the real deal cause I’ve never used it before, maybe I got a dud. 🤷🏻‍♀️
"
"
WOW. Terrible product, all around at DevaCurl. I’ve tried more than 6 Deva products and none of them have been successful for my hair. I have 3a/3b. This particular product dried out my hair. No thanks. Definitely do not recommend. And they put formaldehyde in there. Uhhh
"
"
Didn’t work for me but I have thin low porosity wavy / curly hair and it just felt tangled and sticky. I don’t think it’s bad for everyone just seems to not work with my hair type. Smell is nice!
"
"
I tried some of DevaCurl's regular gel and it was too intense for my hair. But the Light Hold is perfect. I have think, mostly wavy hair (2A or B, depending on the day). This is better than other mousses or curl creams I've tried. Still feels a little sticky/tangly on the second day, but there seems to be no way around that for me.
"
"
I have been purchasing this product for years.  The last bottle that I got is completely watered down.  It is not the same Deva Curl Light that I have been getting for ages.  My daughter said the same thing - she asked if I had put water in with the hair gel - This is a rip off.  $35 for watered down gel.
"
"
this is the only place I come to buy this gel one because it's the best price you'll find and to this is the only gel I will use for my curly hair.
"
"
I love the way this looks on my daughter's tight curls.  While I may not love the scent, it doesn't bother me one bit.  The important part is how nice it makes my daughter's hair while taking the frizz away.  I highly recommend this product!
"
"
Me encanta usar este gel para darle más definición a mis chinos. No me deja el pelo duro y el olor es muy rico. La textura de este gel se siente como agua y es suave.
"
"
I love to be in a bind for time...no worries...just use this product and leave the house.  It is a perfect gel and is light enough to scrunch and not be able to tell you ran out of the house.
"
"
I was skeptical to use a light hold since my curls get looser towards the end of the day, but this is still lightweight with hold. I love that my morning curls don't look crispy also.
"
"
Hair started coming out more in the shower after only a handful of use. It also made my hair tangled, which it never is. I should have started with the smaller bottle. I'm not sure I can return it now. I did more research discovering many others who have experienced hairloss due to devacurl.
"
"
This is the product that really made my hair look incredible. I have 2b, not very thick hair, and this works very well to define my waves. I haven’t used any other hair products before this one, so I can’t compare it to anything else. I’m just so grateful that my hair isnt a disgusting frizzy mop anymore. Also the scent is INCREDIBLE.
"
"
Definitely a value for your money and doesn't leave your hair as stiff as the extra control. The scent is amazing as well.
"
"
I really like this product. It leaves my hair manageable without the hard crunch that other products leave. My hair ends up so soft & the curls are so popping! The only product that leaves my hair the way I've always wanted it - hassle free, light weight & so soft
"
"
This product is nothing different than anything I’ve ever tried with any other product. Will not be using again
"
"
Terrible smell. Does not smell like the normal Devacurl products. As a customer for ten years of devacurl I’ve never had this issue. Seller was czbrm.
"
"
My favorite gel by far. Will absolutely purchase again. Great price. Works so well, just as described. This stuff is great!!
"
"
After buying a 12 oz. bottle for $25+ I am so happy I finally looked her. This is my favorite hair care product! Works well on my mixed curls :)
"
"
This product does define your curls...but the cost is it dries hair to the point the knots get unmanageable and hair breaks into pieces. Not worth it
"
"
Wife loves this product line and it makes her curly hair look amazing all day long ;)
"
"
I haven’t used any other deva curl products but this one. I have been skeptical since this is a more costly brand. However since I’ve been using just this gel...people have noticed. The following morning coworkers noticed my hair was “curlier” vs. straggly. I def can see a difference myself’
"
"
Want perfect curls? Here ya go. This gel freaked me out at first because you have to let it dry (airdry or with hair dryer) completely. When it's completely dry, it looks stiff AF -BUT!! Just crush up your curls to break the gel cast and maybe give your scalp a quick massage to shake the curls out a bit and VOILA! Beautiful curls every time.

Combined with Deva curl no poo and conditioner this product really does enhance natural curls.  My hair is fine, naturally wavy, and there is a lot of it. With these products I have lots of soft curls which last for days. The only down side is that the gel has to be applied to sopping wet hair. Supposedly you can then press out the excess with a microfiber cloth or soft t shirt, but I haven't figured out how to do that successfully without flattening out the curl.
"
"
Pretty great hold and not crunchy like most gels! I mix it with the DevaCurl styling cream, about 25% of the gel to 75% of the cream and I get a really nice hold with super shiny, soft curls. I LOVE the smell.... honestly an amazing scent for hair products.
"
"
I fell in love with this gel after the first time I used it! My hair used to be naturally very curly, but started to become more on the wavy side. However, the FL humidity had me searching for better products to bring back my curly hair. This gel brought back my curls in a natural way and hydrated my hair. Good bye straightener and hello Deva curl!!!
"
"
Love diva curl gel. Smells sooo good. It was cheap and easy to get it from amazon. Plan to reorder.
"
"
The product I received was not the real deal. They put something else in the same packaging, but it definitely is not DevaCurl styling gel. It evaporates in your hand almost, like hand sanitizer. Buyer beware.
"
"
Really love this stuff- it's so light and yet still holds a bit. This last container came with a broken pump though. Bummer. I've been too busy to figure out how to replace it though.
"
"
Love it!  Does not make hair stiff and easy to style or let dry curly.
"
"
Love the product. Wish it wasn't quite as expensive but I'll pay the price for the great product.
"
"
Love the product. Did not love the fact that when I received it 1/4 of it was all over the plastic it was shipped in. I would suggest a way to secure the cap so this is not a continued issue.
"
"
Great product however I just repurchased it after finishing my last bottle and the dispenser doesn't work. I even tried it with my old dispenser. Same problem. I don't know if they changed the formulation and the product is now thicker or what but it's really annoying to have to unscrew the top each time and pour it out by hand.
"
"
Love!  I have used many other expensive hair care products for curly hair. This is the best. It defines my curls and it doesn’t leave them crunchy.
"
"
Love this gel...is the only one that I will use for my curly hair!
"
"
I love this product! Smells clean and leaves hair soft when used in moderation.  If you use a lot it will tighten the curl. Worth a try if you want healthy curly hair!
"
"
It didn’t make my hair crunchy and didn’t weigh down my waves. And it smelled amazing!
"
"
I get this all the time. Love devacurl!
"
"
My daughter and I have been using diva products for a couple of years. Never disappointed in the quality of the products and how it make the curls defined and frizzy.
"
"
Love this gel, the pump makes it even easier to apply quickly during my morning routine.
"
"
Simple, clean, and a firm hold.  Mix with the styling creme to get a nice all day look.  Best part is that it rinses clean with water.
"
"
I found that the big size didn't work as well as the sample. Still use it but it's just not the same. I did have the samples for a few years before actually trying it. Wonder if it expired??  If so, I liked the expired product better.
"
"
This stuff does great on my hair, I put it in my hair while I'm still in the shower, 4 pumps, hair flipped upside down, comb through with fingers, then scrunch.  I then use my DEVA towel.  LOVE it! Good Smell too!
"
"
The best curly gel ever! Always holds well and does not dry crunchy!
"
"
It's perfect! the original is too heavy for my hair. I use this with B'Leave-in and One Condition for nearly perfect frizz-free curls!
"
"
Used before and like it for my hair that need some control
"
"
It’s a good product. Too bad it was delivered about 20% empty....
"
"
Keeps my hair from frizzing and living in Florida that’s a must
"
"
Do not buy!!! This is going in the trash. It dries my hair out and leaves it frizzy after only a few hours. This is definitely not a real devacurl product, I have been using their light defining gel for a long time and i’ve seen a significant difference since I got this specific bottle.
"
"
My go to hair gel. Pricey but worth it, for me. I buy in bulk and haven't found anything better yet.
"
"
Love this product because it controls my curls without leaving my hair feeling that I have put a lot of product in it.  Leaves my hair feeling natural and light without the curls being frizzy.
"
"
The light defining gel gives manageable curls without stiffness
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and have tried everything from mousse to gel and back again. Gels left my hair stiff and wet looking. Mousse needed to be used in just the right amount (too little= frizz, too much= greasy looking) and had a hard time lasting all day. I found a curly hair specialist on Yelp and after my haircut she used this product. Yay!!! This gel is amazing! I was worried when she went to use a gel but this stuff is great! It doesn't make my hair slimy, stiff or greasy but controls frizz and lasts all day. I also love that I can still play with my hair some without a disaster.
"
"
Worth it to buy in the big bottle, it's great for my hair!
"
"
This is the best gel I’ve tried. Curly haired girls ask me what products I use, so it’s a keeper!
"
"
I bought this on a friend’s recommendation. It’s excellent for my thick curly hair! I love it.
"
"
I love this product and the price offered by Amazon.com.  I have been paying the almost the same amount for a 12oz bottle, and from Amazon, for a few dollars more got a 32 oz bottle.  I have recommended Amazon to several of my family and friends for this product.  The delivery was within a reasonable time and I am very pleased.  Thank You so much,  Debra Barber
"
"
I like the light gel. It works well for reducing frizz without leaving residue. Great for a natural feel to your hair.
"
"
Great Gel.. holds curl all day!
"
"
This product brought my wave back without the frizzies.  My hair looks healthy again.
"
"
Devacurl products are unparalleled! I will never go back to cheap $5 hair gel from the pharmacy after this. My curls are soft and frizz free (or... significantly less frizzy than before).
"
"
Love this hair gel. I've had it for about a month now and have used it for severe al different hair styles on wet and dry hair. It helps it stay straight if I straighten it or stay curly if I go to bed with wet hair. My hair stays soft and in shape all day and this gel doesn't dry it out.
"
"
I have been using this and other products by DEVA because I have curly hair and it does the job to keep the curls while keeping out the frizzies.  Anyone with curly hair knows how frizzies ruin everything.  I would recommend this to anyone with curls. For years I did everything to deny my curls...even perms to straighten it.  Several years ago I learned of these products and started using them.  Now, I am a curly girl who gets compliments,even from my male friends.
"
"
Not that helpful to maintain curles
"
"
It felt sticky and viscous when I applied it, but the results were spectacular: plentiful and fluffy curls that held up well for several days, including a day humid with rain. The fragrance was too strong for me, but this is my only complaint. A curly-headed friend of mine recommended this product, and I'm glad she did.
"
"
It does amazing things with my curls. Love it! They have more body, more staying power. This really works.
"
"
This is, as described, a lighter version of the Deva Curl gel. Having tried the firmer hold gel previously, I think I will return to it, but for someone who wants a lighter product, I recommend it.
"
"
Devacurl Light Defining Gel works well at holding my curls. I have thick, coarse hair and thus far this is the best product I've found.
"
"
This product rates right alongside every other styling product. It won't make you suddenly have curly hair if you don't already but it does lightly hold, like it says. What I've found that works very well is just a simple heat protection spray and hairspray. The heat protection spray eliminates frizz.
"
"
I love the product but bottle was broken and leaking everywhere while shipping box is ok
"
"
Great product
"
"
Works great ,
"
"
Love diva curl products! Very light and smells good
"
"
Marc Anthony curl foam works way better for a fraction of the price
"
"
Way cheaper than getting from Ulta store. Package was intact, no issues!
"
"
Works well and much cheaper than at brick and mortar stores.
"
"
Love it!  No crunch at all. I have very wavy hair and not really curly corkscrew type. I used this all by itself after washing and conditioning with L’Oréal Ever Curl and then “ plopped it” into a T-shirt for a half hour and finishing off with diffuser. I always do that last part so I’d have to say the deva curl made the difference here. Very pretty definition and I like the “dry” consistency of this gel. Some gels are so moisturizing they act almost like a detangler when you run it through your sopping wet hair. This had the opposite texture. It feels like it’s clumping your hair instead and almost felt like you couldn’t tell if you put enough on bc there is no after feel of product like I am used to. Anyway, I’m happy with this and the photo is taken after sleeping on it all night. That’s how awesome the hold is. I didn’t do anything to it this morning except put a pin in the front.
"
"
I really like this hair product. It's not as heavy as other gels I've used, and it gives my hair better defined curls. It feels at first like it's not going to work, but once your hair dries it comes out perfect every time. Highly recommend.
"
"
Great product.  Great price.  Great service.
"
"
Deva Curl products work well with my curly hair. The Light Defining Gel  has the perfect amount of hold and gives my curls definition and body.
"
"
Love this product. Great for naturally curly hair.
"
"
I love devacurl products. They are great for curly hair and not too heavy. Everyone compliments me on the smell of my hair and I use the entire deva line except for the shampoo. I still use AG Recoil shampoo. I love the smell of that too!
"
"
This gel, along with the rest of the Deva Curl line works magic on my hair. Before I had a baby my hair was curly with many ringlets, springy curls etc. After baby my hair changed and I couldn't hold the curl anymore. My hair would end up straight, wavy and curly and look a mess. This product line has given me consistent curly hair with very little straight and wavy spots. Do not brush your hair between washings! You must remoisten a little in the am and twist it a little to refresh curl. Then spray the stray hair. Again do not brush, comb or pick it.
"
"
Is wonderful. The hair looks natural and no crunchiness.
"
"
This really works for my fine curly hair.
"
"
This stuff works great! I found I need a lot more of it than I originally thought though. But it creates beautiful curls and holds well. I especially like that with a little spritz of water you can reactivate it.
"
"
Yea
"
"
Works ok. Just another gel.
"
"
I like this product. Doesn't leave my hair feeling weighed down. Will be interesting to see how my hair holds up in the humid weather come summer time. I am keeping my fingers crossed that my hair won't get frizzy.
"
"
This is the only product that works on my hair. I have somewhat relaxed curls and this picks them up.
"
"
Thank you,
"
"
Love this gel! I mix it with the Deva styling cream. I have fine color-treated curly hair this combination helps to keep the frizz away.
"
"
Deva has amazing products.  There just needs to be better packaging so no leakage from the bottle during shipping.
"
"
Love this product! Works well with curly hair!
"
"
Have used this in the past with better redults.  Product seems weaker.  Disappointed that i bought such a large bottle.
"
"
My 3B-3C curls love this product. I used it right out of the shower and for soft hold for up-dos. It's a great, non-tacky, non-crunchy hair gel.
"
"
The product is amazing I’ve been using for my daughters hair however, the bottle was delivered and it was open and a quarter of the product spilled out.  This brand is pretty pricey and I’m upset that we lost so much gel.
"
"
my stylist recommended it and its working great!
"
"
Keeps curls all day
"
"
Finally a gel that makes my curls feel AMAZING.  It has taken me forever to try this out and im glad i finally did. My curls look big and full.
"
"
The best solution for curly hair that i have ever found.  I use a lot of this each time of application but you never see or feel the product like you do with other stuff that makes your hair crispy.  After this dries just crunch your hair and it disappears. I have recommended this to a lot of people who all agree after buying it.
"
"
It's not sticky and does not give my hair the wet look, but it really does not provide any hold, so I just use it the non-wash day to smooth my hair with wet hands. I won't get it again.
"
"
I love this product & was very happy once I compared the prices from Ultra Store & Amazon. I will never go to the store to purchase anything now.
"
"
I love the Deva line.  I use this in the winter and the ultra on humid, hot or rainy days.
"
"
Love this product!!! I use it on me and all of my girls!
"
"
Had to stock up because this stuff is awesome
"
"
I’m a total Diva girl...
"
"
Perfect gel for my fine hair, it's not too heavy and I love the smell.
"
"
it does define without weighing hair down, and is not sticky or stiff once dried in the hair..
"
"
this product is gooooood and i was surprised of the size and price!
"
"
Love love love this gel! Works great with my fine naturally curly hair. Doesn't make my hair sticky or crunchy.
"
"
The product I received was not the one pictured, instead was an old version of the product. The pump was broken as well so overall I was disappointed in the way it was received and I will not be repurchasing from Amazon.
"
"
Muy buen producto buens definición
"
"
I waited a LONG time before I purchased this gel. I have been using No Poo and One Condition for some time, successfully. I tried a variety of less pricey gels and most recently was liking Garnier Wonder Waves (which seems to be discontinued and is selling for at high price points - which it never did before - on Amazon).Like so many product lines, Deva Curl says its products are most effective when used together (I mean, what else are they going say?!)  My hair is a mix of fine waves & curls and it's very particular - I think it'd be classified 2B or ""cherub"".  Heavy gels make my hair look too sticky or weighted down so I figured the light hold would be the best option.When I first tried it, I would say it made my hair ""fluffy."" I wasn't shooting for - or expecting a ""fluffy"" look. Subsequent uses simply made my hair flat. Bad flat. I've seen in the last couple years since I've been doing the whole curly girl thing just how great & curly my hair CAN look - I mean I know it's possible now, at least sometimes! So to have this pricey gel that's supposed to be so great combined with its friends, No Poo and One Condition, produce such lackluster results is very disappointing. I'm not sure who this gel is for, but decidedly not for me.
"
"
I love this product! Scrunch hair and go. It hold well all day.
"
"
Good product
"
"
I've been using this product for years and find that a little goes a long way. Don't over-apply or your hair will get hard and crunchy. A little provides just enough body and hold for my curly hair.
"
"
Great product!!! Must apply then hair is SOAKED. Also, I recommend thoroughly moisturizing hair as gel is a bit drying.
"
"
The product held well, not sticky or stiff
"
"
Best gel ever for curly hair.  No more crunch curls or flaking gel.
"
"
Love deva curl products and arrived when promised!
"
"
Wow! Finally! Corkscrew curls LOVING THIS!!! Easy to use, no crunch, smells great, and no grease.
"
"
I have curly hair and live in South Florida (humid!!!!). Deva Curl products live my hair frizz less, defined and soft...I have so many complements on my hair. Tip: Read the Deva Curl book to learn the right technique base on your curl type.

I absolutely love this product! I recommend it to all of my curly haired friends. I have botticelli curls and this products works better than any I have ever used in my entire life. I use Mizzani conditioner and then use DevaCurl defining gel on top of it and it's great. A must buy for curly girls!
"
"
DevaCurl is my go-to for all of my hair products. I have tried so many other products, but none of them come close to the quality and results of DevaCurl. It has been a lifesaver.
"
"
This makes my hair hard and crunchy and it leaves white flakes. I don't think I will be using this anymore I have an entire bottle just sitting there we stood and no one to use it.
"
"
I can't enough times how much I love these products. Work amazingly on curls.
"
"
Smells amazing and leaves my hair shiny!
"
"
Great for curls
"
"
This stuff is the best.  Smell doesn't bother me and make me sick and it a nice light hold.
"
"
have ""mixed"" hair, have bought every product on the market it feels like, highly recommend this one.
"
"
Smells great, but bottle was busted inside packaging. Lost a significant amount of gel. Really disappointed!!!
"
"
This is the only gel that will tame my curls without stiff hair.  Love it!
"
"
Took a lot longer than expected to arrive, but I like this light gel for my 2c/3a curls. I scrunch it up into my wet hair, dry with a t shirt then diffuse, also looks good sans blowdrying it but my hair will stay wet all day if I don't lol.
"
"
My daughters love this for their curly hair!!! Thanks! And quick shipping 🤗
"
"
LOVE it. Just wishes it were a lil cheaper.
"
"
Keeps my fine frizzy hair in Florida much tamer than anything else I have tried.  Hair easily maintains thicker look all day.  Easy to use too.
"
"
Curly girls rejoice! This is a miracle product!
"
"
Great product, better priced than what I pay for at my hairdressers.
"
"
I don’t like the lack of moisture and the hard curls. It’s such a big bottle , I will use it up, but probably won’t purcg again
"
"
Best product I have ever used for frizzy hair.
"
"
Doesn’t work as I expected.  I’ve used other products that works better. I have very fine hair with soft curls.  My daughter has curly hair so woks fine for her.
"
"
Love this stuff it works so good on my curls
"
"
great buy for the money
"
"
The product is great but I didn't give 5 stars due to this being the 2nd time I have received product with a pump that doesn't work.
"
"
Perfect size. Great for helping with definition and second day curls
"
"
This product is wonderful. I have naturally curly hair. I apply a little of this while my hair is wet and I have flawless curls and no frizz.
"
"
My has been using the devaCurl products for over a year and love them.
"
"
Works great and doesn't make my hair crunchy.
"
"
Wife loves the stuff.
"
"
Best gel out there for a curly girl
"
"
Have tried many different products and I like this one the best. I like it better than Deva's Ultra Defining Gel.  This one gives good hold without making your hair stiff, sticky or gummy or weighting it down.  Hair still feels soft after I ""scrunch"" it out.
"
"
Very light on your hair. Wish I had bought the more heavy duty defining gel but this still works well. Definitely cheaper than buying at the salon!
"
"
I can't believe how much of a difference this product has on my curly hair, totally worth the $$$
"
"
It is really good but my hair is still somewhat frizzy after I use it
"
"
Received the arc angel instead of the light defining. So was not able to test it out.
"
"
Did not define her curls
"
"
Awesome product!
"
"
This is my favorite hair gel for my long curly hair, I no longer use anything else.  It never feels sticky or gunky or hard, and I like the scent too.  The Deva Curl brand is fantastic.  I order it from amazon to save a few bucks.
"
"
This is the best hair product for curly hair! It keeps my hair curly not crunchy... soft curls!
"
"
A little dab'll do ya'!
"
"
Works as advertised
"
"
This stuff is amazing on my natural curls. Not stuff or crunchy, it just leaves my hair with soft and bouncy curls.
"
"
Works great with natural curl or permed. I’ve used it for both. No flakes, great smell and doesn’t feel heavy.
"
"
I love the product but the pump broke after one use. 🙁
"
"
I absolutely love this gel! It's not very heavy at all so it doesn't weigh your curls down. It does hold my curly, frizzy hair very well. It reduces my frizz quite a bit and leaves my curls soft and defined. I highly recommend this product!
"
"
I love this gel.  My hair is long and needs a lot of gel to get the curls/waves have any definition.  I usually use the size of a walnut on each ""side"" of my hair after towel drying it, scrunch it, and then use a little more once the hair dries a little.  NOT crunchy, soft, and provides defintion.
"
"
I used this on a recommendation from my hair stylist to bring out my natural curl. It’s the easiest to use and I love it!
"
"
These are the worst product for curly hair!!!!  My hair has thinned out since I started using this product line!!  Save your hair and don’t do it!!!
"
"
My daughter has curly hair and really likes this product. It does not make her curls stiff or sticky. The curls are defined and soft.
"
"
I love using this gel combined with the styling cream.  Keeps my curls in place and full all day.
"
"
Clumps curls into nice spirals
"
"
When I first started using this product, I was concerned by how ""stringy"" and flat my hair looked after application. I was concerned it was too heavy of a product for my fine hair.  After it dried and I ""uncrunched"" the stringy look, it was fabulous!  Great control while not leavin behind the stiffness that other gels have done.
"
"
Not the same product I get from my hairdresser this is very drying and my hair is frizzy after every use. 32oz bottle only used 2x. What a waste of money
"
"
Works great! This is the third time I've purchased!
"
"
Easy to use and good light gel for curly hair
"
"
Did not define my curls
"
"
I apply this to my fresh-out-of-the-shower damp hair and allow it to air dry. It takes my matted poodle mane of a bird's nest and turns it into shiny diva-licious goddess curls. It helps my hair do what it wishes it could on it's own.My mom used to tell me to eat my bread crust because it would make my hair curly. She was wrong! Deva Curl makes your hair curly. You can throw those crusts to the curb!
"
"
Works great for my fine hair. Doesn't weigh it down yet gives me the hold I need!
"
"
Dries my hair out really bad, which is a shame because it makes my curls very defined.
"
"
Lightweight but makes a lot of curls.
"
"
Provides good hold for my curls without crunchiness. Keeps moisture out preventing big hair.
"
"
I bought this after reading an article on the best products for those of us with curly hair.  This was listed in it along with a picture of a before and after. Of course the curls in the after were amazing.I kind of was skeptical reading one lady's review of how this shocked them.  In fact I thought to myself, yeah right.The first time I used it, it did shock me.  It was like a little static electricity zing. It hasn't happened since but I stopped thinking that reviewer had last her mind.All in all, it does a good job of keeping my hair frizz free, and it does define my curls much better than regular mouse or gel, it just doesn't define them as much as I like.I still prefer Miss Jessie's pillow soft curls and will go back to buying that from now on.
"
"
Product is good but it took forever to get to me.
"
"
I love this gel but when it arrived, it had leaved all over the package.
"
"
I absolutely love this gel.  I finally found a product that doesn't weigh down my hair.
"
"
Bought product for my niece who has really curly hair and it worked amazingly.  Her curs look beautiful :)
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
Fake product. Does not perform as usual.
"
"
Didn't like this product at first but the more I use it, the more I love it.  Went back to my old products & realize how great this really is.  I love it!
"
"
I love the results, but have to say, ""Light Hold"" means light hold. I was hoping for a little more definition, so maybe I'll try the regular hold next time. But it's a great product and doesn't leave my hair crunchy or dry!!
"
"
My salon manager suggested all the Deva products and I have purchased them all. They assist ""old"" hair from losing a perm. They are truly amazing for thinning hair. I endorse the Deva Curl No Poo products 100%""
"
"
Great product for curly hair. Doesn't leave your hair sticky or crunchy.  Will continue to buy again and again.
"
"
Tames my curly curls and frizzies in the high humidity of the Gulf Coast without the heavy weight, greasiness, or still hair feeling of other products. Immediately after a brief towel dry and comb out, I apply one pump, working t through my hair  from the underneath first, then the sides and top. Before drying, using dryer with diffuser, I apply a half pump working the ends up. It styles nicely and my hair looks great. I've also totally dried and straightened my hair either with a round brush and even full flatiron work. Product leaves my hair frizz free and makes styling really easy.
"
"
I only use Deva products on my very curly hair. Its the best! With Amazon Prime it is the most convenient and economical way to shop
"
"
Awesome price.
"
"
I like this gel because it isn't too heavy and doesn't feel sticky.
"
"
Apply on wet hair only
"
"
Like the product,  works well . Cost a bit much
"
"
Great product
"
"
Not sure I will buy this again. The product itself just did not meet my expectations.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
A most necessary hair product for ‘curly’ girls! Helps define curls, tones down the frizzies and is not outrageous cost-wise.
"
"
I apply about a dime size to my wet hair and then crunch up with my fingers.  It dries very soft and shiny.  I LOVE it!
"
"
Very effective curl and style holder. No needFor hairspray.
"
"
I use all of DevaCurl products. I have very tight curls and it seems to have a good hold without stiffness.
"
"
This may be fine for some, but I prefer the #1 conditioner by Deva Curl.  Nothing wrong with this one, but it just doesn't do as much for my hair.
"
"
Works well, just the right amount of hold
"
"
Best product for curly hair!
"
"
Defines curls without the crunch
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Where were you Deva Curl when I was in grade school? Middle school...high school? You have tamed my fro in ways I never dreamed. I thank you thank you for my curls.
"
"
Did not receive the item I ordered and the bottle was opened and sticky with product all over.
"
"
Leaves your hair soft and feeling clean
"
"
Great for curly hair!  Not heavy..not ""gunky"". Very light, but still holds the curl!
"
"
Very sticky
"
"
Love Deva products
"
"
The product arrived with a cracked open cap that resulted in the gel seeping out through the package material. Disappointed in how the product was padded to ensure the bottle wouldn't break.
"
"
I like it.  It's very light, smells great, and looks good on my hair.
"
"
excellent product, enjoy using it, doesn't make my hair feel gummy
"
"
Love it. Would buy again.
"
"
This product smells so good! It doesn’t feel like gel but it does define your curls and minimize frizz.
"
"
Tried No Poo, One Condition and the Angel Gel.  The shampoo and conditioner do cause your curls to 'behave' differently.  The curls are definitely more defined but I didn't have great success with the gel on my short naturally curly hair.  I generally let my hair dry after applying the product on and then lightly lift my curls with my fingers at the scalp to give it a bit more volume.  In doing so it always results in frizz on the top of my hair.  I have tried applying some conditioner and then some gel with poor results.  I am not a fan of this product and after trying it seven or eight times will relegate it to the back of my cabinet.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and I LOVE this product.  Use it everyday after shower.  Just comb my hair, flip head over, apply Deva Curl gel and flip back.  That's it.  Holds my curls great all day long.  I've been using this for years now.
"
"
My new favorite!

I've used just about every gel out there on my naturally curly hair.  They usually leave my hair sticky, or crunchy.  This does neither.  Leaves your hair soft but with defined curls.  The only way to go.
"
"
These products are miracle workers; it's the only thing that has made my frizzy hair into cute and much complimented curls!  I also recommend reading Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey both has made me love my curls!
"
"
I love the product but my order was damaged was not able to use it
"
"
Best thing I’ve found for curly hair
"
"
I love the deva curl line. This gel is wonderful after you scrunch the crunch. Ringlets that are soft and frizz free. I find my hair to be flat at the crown but very shiny and frizz free.
"
"
I was pleasantly surprised by this product. Great hold, good curl definition, smells good and non drying. Mixes well with my Trader Joes TTT
"
"
Not good at all makes hair dry out
"
"
The gel is extremely watery.  Seems like it was watered down.
"
"
item is in good condition
"
"
Nice level of hold without being very sticky.  Leaves hair shiny.,
"
"
Love it
"
"
Best curly hair product!
"
"
Love love love
"
"
It goes on nicely and seems light, but after it dries my hair becomes very thick.
"
"
This is my go to hair gel
"
"
Has bleached multiple sets of colored towels; something caustic in ingredients
"
"
Best gel ever!
"
"
Holds fairly good.
"
"
I really love this gel!  I hate to sound like a commercial, but even if you don't invest in the shampoo/conditioner Deva products, I would just get this gel.  It doesn't make your hair crunchy, but gives a lot of definition and so much shine!  Careful, don't towel dry your hair before you put the gel in, towels break apart your curls and add to frizz.  Just use an old t-shirt and scrunch upwards on the curls, it has made such a difference for me!
"
"
Love this product
"
"
This is the best curly hair gel ever- have been using it for years. It smells amazing and doesn't leave hair sticky or crunchy at all. I use the deva technique devoutly.
"
"
This is watered down. This is not the real deal. Buy it from someone else
"
"
Dicen sin efecto a cartonado. pero es mentira es gelatina.
"
"
product arrived open and I had to arrange for a refund.
"
"
I love the scent of this gel. It actually locks curl, does not feel crunchy and has not been drying to my hair.
"
"
I was worried that it would be too smelly or too crunchy and it's neither; it's just perfect.  I really have an aversion to smells and perfumes, so that says a lot.
"
"
Didn't do much for my hair.
"
"
The product is great. But the bottle was not secured and it spilled
"
"
Love this product!  Soft curl...not too much crunch.
"
"
Ok I have straight hair and now I have curls and body
"
"
This works wonders on my curls.  Best product I've tried  ... and I've tried plenty!
"
"
If you have natural curl and fine hair this is the stuff for you
"
"
Love this stuff and have yet to find a better price!
"
"
works well for my curly hair
"
"
Perfect amount of control for my fine hair; I will buy this one again.
"
"
Very good have been using for years
"
"
My favorite. I found after our Sebastian Wet stock was depleted and am very happy.  Read the Curly Girl book too!
"
"
Great product for natural curls!
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Good gel for thin curly hair
"
"
It does work but my hair is thick and curly so it takes a lot
"
"
This is the best hair gel.  It doesn't leave your hair dry or crunchy, but allows your to style it or let it curl while holding the curl.
"
"
great product for wavy hair
"
"
I love love this product and product line! Great for curly hair. It defines the curls. I have been using for 2 years
"
"
I am sorely upset. I thought this gel would be fantastic, but it left my hair a sticky mess. Think Bride of Frankenstein! I tried applying it in the shower; from smooth to gross in one step! I also tried minute amounts post shower -  - or was it glue?
"
"
Great product. Light enough not to crunch!
"
"
Best gel for curly hair!
"
"
This works great on my 2b/c wavy curls.
"
"
Best gel I’ve ever used
"
"
Dries out my hair and leaves it crunchy. Would not recommend if you have coarse and dry hair.
"
"
This makes my hair even curlier, just love it I get spirals, just beautiful. It does not build up and rinses out easily.
"
"
Item came damaged. Gel leaked all over the box it came in. Next time I will just buy in the store.
"
"
Love this product line.
"
"
This is the best because it doesn't make your hair hard and crunchy. Instead soft, curly, bouncy etc. It also just rinses out with water. This product is not sold at very many hair salons so it is best to order it on amazon. It came promptly.
"
"
I am happy with the performance of this product
"
"
Good product...same as the salon sells for less. Unfortunately it got frozen. It was left in my mail box on a very cold day and when I got it it was frozen solid. I thawed it and it seems OK. I've been using it and so far it has not separated.
"
"
Works great with my curly hair.
"
"
The hold is firm but not hard. I normally do not use any type of gel, but I like this one.
"
"
I get bored and try something else, only to come back to this stuff again and again.  I have fine, thin, curly hair that I usually air dry.  This stuff doesn't leave a crunch and it keeps the frizz down.
"
"
Awesome product for a competitive price.
"
"
Work wonders for my hair !
"
"
The product is okay, but the bottle/dispenser it is in, is very difficult to get out.  Having to squeeze the bottle to get it out, smashes the bottle.  I would like a refund. Thank you.
"
"
I have been using this product for almost two years and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!
"
"
I got the best use from this product by watching youtube videos.  It creates a lot of curl out of my wavy hair.
"
"
I prefer the styling cream.
"
"
Exact same product as in Ulta.....but at a much better price!  Love my curly hair since using this product!
"
"
Great product!
"
"
I'm new to this line of products so feeling my way through it.  Trial and error.  This product keeps my hair feeling soft, but does not come close enough to controlling the frizz.  It is a ""light defining gel"".  I feel that is an accurate description.  Folks who tend to frizz are going to need something a bit stronger.
"
"
Provides very poor curl definition and hold.
"
"
This has a lovely smell and does well with frizzies, but I prefer a little more hold.  I mix this with Matrix Gelee, and it's perfect for my curly, flyaway hair.
"
"
Did not work well at all for me.  I have fine natural curls and this product gave me no definition at all.  I will go back to Samy curl constructor.
"
"
I have been using the diva products for over a year. With my super curly blond hair I have finally found the right stuff
"
"
I can tell no difference in this gel than any other gel I've bought.  It works no better, and it also stiffens when it dries.  It's definitely not worth reordering to me.
"
"
Deva curl has always been part of my life
"
"
Didnt do well with my hair, expensive
"
"
Worked just like I hoped it would. It really manages my curls while not making them crunchy hard or frizzy. Prompt shipping, as well.
"
"
I love this product.  I have not straightened my hair since I started using Deva's product.
"
"
This product is horrible
"
"
Curls are more defined
"
"
Great product!  Been using it for many years. But the pump wouldn't work. So I pushed the straw in more and it works fine!
"
"
Like the hold without the crunchy flaky result of other hair gels.
"
"
I like this very well does not feel crunchy.Fast ship time also
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Ok
"
"
Excellent product, excellent buying experience!
"
"
Great product. However the push top in the bottle was broken into pieces when we received it
"
"
I love it
"
"
It's ok but not sure it's worth the money.
"
"
Light, water-based gel for soft curls. Love it.  This is my new go-to product for care-free style
"
"
Love this light gel, just as described.
"
"
Great product, arrived in a timely manner
"
"
Good
"
"
It is a soft hold that doesn't leave my hair crunchy.  I just wish they had one for dry hair.
"
"
Love it, works very well, just the right hold.
"
"
I have naturally very curly, thick hair. My hair dresser recommended this product and I've happily used it ever since. The curls are soft and manageable. The trick is to not skimp. I had long, thick, curly hair (mid-back), I use the product right out of the shower. Be sure to squeeze excess water out of your hair, maybe scrunch lightly with a towel (sorry, won't spend the money on hair only micro-cotton towels). I just pull my hair into to parts, then one full pump depression, get on both hands and work through the length. Another half pump or so just for the front, and top. Just use your fingers to make sure it is evenly distributed through out(I usually brushing my hair out before getting it wet). Using fingers instead of a comb (even wide tooth) usually keeps the curls big & loose. I just push into the style, maybe scrunch it a time or two as it dries and I'm good to go.
"
"
This great, except for the fact the pump was broken!
"
"
This product was a big dissapointment. I have very thin, frizzy hair and while it did activate my curls it’s very drying for my hair and leaves it feeling dirty. Worst of all it leaves white flaky residue in my hair similar to hairspray, so I have to wash my hair after each use. Anyone that has curly hair knows not to over wash it as its naturally dry.  I’ve gotten better results from Bed Head products at a fraction of the price.
"
"
Works ok... not as good as the 3 oz bottle I tried.
"
"
My daughter loves this product!
"
"
Made my curls flat, stringy, and sticky.  Ugh.  I'm sticking to Ouidad from now on.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Best gel to keep curly hair curly without feeling overly gelled! Love!
"
"
I love this gel. Holds my curl's forms lightly and doesn't feel like a sticky or stiff gel.
"
"
This gel dries my hair.
"
"
This works wonderfully for my 2 yo son and 3 yo daughter's hair!
"
"
Dry and crunchy, unless applied with water.
"
"
I wanted to like this, because I'm very happy with the rest of the DEVA line. But it doesn't do anything for my hair. Well, it does do something: it dries it out, makes the curls separate and look dead. I know other people who love this, so it must be hair-type dependent. I (obviously) have curly hair. It tends to do well with products that add moisture. My hair is fairly thin for curly hair.
"
"
Great transaction.  Love this product.
"
"
This leaves my curls soft and flexible but not frizzy. It's the best gel that i've ever used for this, to keep my hair curly versus blowing it out. It is amazing and I've ordered it again already to keep at another home. I would NOT want to be without it from now on. I hope they do not discontinue it as so many companies do. They get something that works and sells and then discontinue. So please don't do that 'Curly Girl'!!!
"
"
You have to use only the smallest amount. It's light but it's also very drying.
"
"
I used to use moose and it just makes your hair really hard and have the wet look and if that's what your going for then its fine but angel gives you the control without the extreme hardness gel leaves you with. All in all I'm loving all the deva curl products I've tried so far :-)
"
"
Awesome live the product!!
"
"
Very light.
"
"
Purchased after reading ""Curly Girl The Handbook"" by Deva Curl, and I now only use DEVA products in my long curly hair.Using as directed, this truly does hold my curls for several days without feeling 'crunchy'.  My hair stays soft and my curls stay well-defined without getting frizzy.  This does not weigh my hair down - volume stays nice & full.I 'reactivate' on day 2 & 3 by spritzing with water
"
"
The pump i received does not work. Can you please ship me a new pump? Thank you!
"
"
Rest stuff, great smell too
"
"
It is VERY important to apply this product to the hair when it is soaking wet. I applied it in the shower after rinsing out the One Conditioner. I finger parted the hair into about four-five sections AND parted the front of my hair to the side I wanted my part on; and then made sure I saturated and scrunched each section as directed on the bottle. ONCE out the shower, I scrunched the heat damaged areas more and clamped them up with hair clips while the rest of the hair hung free. I diffused my hair on warm/high until it was 85% dry (focusing on the roots and the ends). I then unclasp the heat damaged areas and diffused (try not to scrunch or make that area frizzy). My curls were super defining, not crunchy, and have volume for days! My hair type is 3C/4A with heat damage to the front.
"
"
Great product.  It really does help activate curls and keep frizz at bay without looking like I have anything in my hair.  Love the ""cleaner"" ingredient deck too.
"
"
This is a great gel.  Leaves my curls bouncy and not at all stiff.  It is my go-to product.  Highly recommend.
"
"
Perhaps I don't know how to use this product properly, however I do not like. Shipping and product came quickly and I am happy with that. I have been using this for several weeks now and I just don't like it. I figured that I am pretty versed in doing my hair.I moved to florida and have been unhappy with how my hair has been lately. I really had high hopes for this product, but it will probably go in the product graveyard under my sink.I feel like this does not have enough hold (even added the curl boost and volumizer for additional hold). It weighs down my hair and makes my hair feel...well gritty. My hair tangles really bad with the product and leaves it flat and lifeless. Tried blow drying and air drying.I find that there are curly hair products for everyone but not all products are for everyone...this one just isn't for me :(
"
"
I've tried a few of the other DevaCurl products(Set It Free spray and the foam), but usually need to switch up my products every few months. This has worked well for me, though some days the humidity is too much for even this. Most of the time, it helps give a little bounce and a moderate hold to my curls. I may try the stronger gel in the future, but was wary of it weighing my hair down too much.
"
"
Great product, fast delivery! Maintains a wonderful curl pattern all day without a gel-like residue and it smells great!  Worth it!
"
"
I have naturally frizzy wavy hair. I've tried using gels, but I usually find they just make my hair crunchy. This hair gives your hair hold without the crunch. It looks natural and your hair still has a lot of movement to it. I would definitely recommend this product.
"
"
I have never found any product that worked to keep the curl in my daughter's hair, keep it shiny and healthy looking. Every product I used worked great in the beginning and would later dry out. Deva Curl is a great product and now my daugther loves wearing her hair down.
"
"
I have experimented with almost every product out there for curly hair. This stuff is worth the money!I love the way my curls look-- separated, un-crunchy, shiny.
"
"
It's lightweight but gives great control for my curls!
"
"
Great for curly girls
"
"
Great product. Shipped timely
"
"
very good
"
"
I have used many gels on my frizzy curly hair.  I need something that is strong and this is strong enough to hold my hair for the entire day.  It also holds it without making my hair look sticky.  This is in my top three of hair gels.
"
"
I have curly hair and have used dozens of products over the years to try to tame my locks. Apart from a really good cut, using this gel is what makes my hair predictable on a daily basis! A little bit goes a long way.
"
"
This makes my curls look awesome!  Now I love my curly hair.
"
"
I ordered this product, the no-poo & one conditioner. The others 2 products have a nice fragrance, as they did in the salon where I first tried them, but the gel does smell good. I wonder if I got a defective bottle.
"
"
This was part of my foray into Deva Curl products...I'm in love with almost all of them.  I started out as an S curl, but since using these products, my hair is getting curlier (I'm sure it's tired of all the Brazilian blowouts I was getting).  This gel is great, but doesn't quite give as much support as I need.  It works great for one day, so I'll use if I know I'm going to wash my hair again that night, but otherwise, it doesn't hold up well enough for ""2nd day hair"".
"
"
I love deva products but this gel wasn't 'strong' enough for my hair. And yet I also found it harder to wash out than I would have liked.
"
"
Just ok
"
"
This gel is perfect for my naturally curly hair!
"
"
Love the quality and price!
"
"
This is yet another great product from Deva Concepts. My stylist taught me how to use it, and I haven't had any issues with it being sticky or too crunchy. The key is to scrunch it into your hair while it's still pretty wet: you want it to make that squelching noise. I let my hair air-dry without touching it (this is key!) and then re-scrunch when it's dry to break the ""gel cast."" This lets loose soft curls.I don't actually follow the directions to the letter on this; I prefer not to run my fingers through my hair, as it tends to break up the curls and make my hair much frizzier. I just rub the gel between my hands to evenly distribute, then scrunch the ends toward my scalp. This leaves me with big, soft ringlets. It's really made a big difference in my hair. Plus, it smells fantastic!
"
"
As described and shipped early.
"
"
I've wasted so much money trying natural hair products that just disappoint and can't compare to their chemical-laden counterparts.  Try Morrocco Method Blood of the Dragon Styling Gel.  It's the ONLY gel I've tried that holds a style and Curl yet feels clean and is brushable at the end of the day.
"
"
Love this product. Light hold, not sticky.
"
"
LOVE DEVACURL. this is my go to gel, very light and if used correctly, it does not make your hair crunchy.  It also depends on your hair type.  I have naturally curly hair and I do not need a lot of products to make it curly just to define the curls and this is perfect.  I have heard that devacurl makes hair dry, again it depends on your hair type and how you use this product.
"
"
This is an excellent product that makes your hair fall into its natural curl .Its the best I have tried.
"
"
received product on time it is what I was looking for.
"
"
Good hold and curl enhancer
"
"
I never thought i will never say This. But it really working i live it
"
"
Good
"
"
I had tried this before and have tried other curl products but this is light and you cant tell you have anything in your hair.  Makes the curls look nice.
"
"
Love how it tames my hair yet is so light
"
"
I have curly hair and this is a great product for it , u can use on dry or semi dey hair
"
"
Reduces frizz and increases curls.
"
"
This product is good for holding curl but if you don't like your curls hard then I wouldn't recommend you use a lot of this product.
"
"
Love it, love it, love it.  I can't believe something that actually works!  Hmmmm the smell......I LOVE IT!!!  Thank you!
"
"
The gel helps curls hold while giving shine.  Does not dry like some other gels. Love it.......
"
"
Came in time and as exact as its discription.
"
"
I was hesitant to try a gel in my curls because I didn't want '90s inspired ramen noodle hair. This is not the case. It's light weight and does not give you the ""wet-look"" it's the best curl enhancing product I have tried.
"
"
It doesn't do nothing for my frizz at all, even though it made my hair feel light and soft. It just didn't have control over my curls
"
"
After reading tons of articles about curly hair I decided to give this a try before buying the whole line.Used it once yesterday and absolutely hate it.  Makes my hair feel thin and brittle and crunchy.
"
"
Great product.  Received it on time.
"
"
If you have curly hair you can't go wrong with DevaCurl.  Angell is one of the few styling products that I use on my hair every day.  After washing my hair with DevaCurl no-poo and one condition, I coat my curls with Angell while its still damp, and then squeeze out the excess water.  Perfectly formed and hydrated curls every time!
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Love that his product exists! I don’t have to wash my curly hair every day! THhis spray gives me two days reprieve and I love it. Smells great too!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Great product and vendor
"
"
Excellent product!
"
"
I have used this product line for the past year.  This bottle does not work as in the past.  Once it dries, it begins flaking and looks like dandruff!!!  I don't know if I received a defective bottle or if the formula has changed.  I have read several other negative reviews about other products in this line with changed formulas.  I guess this is just one more.Tried contacting Deva Curl and they will not discuss as it was not a 'direct purchase', sorry to hear they do not back their products.
"
"
This, along with the No Poo and One Condition, has transformed my curls.
"
"
Nice for about 4 hrs then hair turns greasy
"
"
Best gel for my mixey hair.
"
"
Works good on my level 2c curls!
"
"
looveee
"
"
This gel works much better than the ultra defining gel. It defines my curls into pretty spirals where the ultra gel gives me the ""wet look"" :(
"
"
I have very fine, curly hair and most products either weigh down my hair so much it has trouble keeping its curl or dry it out so much it gets frizzy. Before DevaCurl I had the most luck with Redken Fresh Curl shampoo, conditioner and curl boost spray as well as L'Oreal Leave-In Conditioner for curls, but even that combo would dry it out a bit too much.My stylist recommended the DevaCurl product line & I am so grateful. It is very moisturizing without being heavy & even the most frizz-prone bits of my hair have spiraled into perfect curls. I tried using some DevaCurl combined with the above-mentioned other brand products I already used & that was an improvement, but once I switched to exclusively DevaCurl stuff every aspect of my hair & curls improved. No, Deva Concepts does not pay me. :)Seriously, this stuff works wonders! My curls are very happy with me now.
"
"
My daughter has curly hair and this is by far the BEST product we've found to use. And the smell is wonderful!
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
The pump does not work. Very disappointing , basically unusable
"
"
I ordered ""Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defing Gel"", and received ""Deva Curl Light Defying Gel"". It's not the same as pictured. The product was opened and very obviously used with tape over the lid that was not a manufacturers seal. Very disappointed!
"
"
Favorite product for curly hair!
"
"
This gel can be a bit heavy, so I tend to use it sparingly. It keeps the frizz to an absolute minimum, when you use it according to the directions. I get more compliments on my hair when I use this product than I get with any other!
"
"
Love these products
"
"
I was introducted to Deva Curl products a few months ago and have been hooked ever since.  Never knew my hair could look so good.
"
"
I love this product it really defined my curls and didn't weigh them down. It holds your curls without making them feel or look crunchy! Also this product has no sulfates, silicone's, and parabens which a major benefit for curly hair! definitely a staple to my curly hair routine
"
"
Contains wheat. Why do hair products keep putting major allergens in their ingredients?! That's $18 down the drain!
"
"
I don't wash my hair every night because I was use to being able to recycle my hair the next day.  Using this product THAT was NOT happening.  Not to mention by the end of the day my hair was a little frizzy...yes I put enough gel in my hair. lol
"
"
Just what I asked for.
"
"
Nice!
"
"
Devacurl products are fabulous. I ordered this product on August 8th and it is August 20th and still has not arrived. Next time,I will order from another site.
"
"
Love this gel for my curly hair. I haven't found anything even close to it. It disappears and makes your hair seem natural, but continues to hold your curls and keep frizz down.
"
"
These products are way overpriced.  You can find more inexpensive products that do the same.  It's all about knowing the process of handling curls.  The no crunch is true for this product and my wavy hair keeps a nice shape however it's still frizzy and actually very drying.  My hair is not smooth or shiny at all.  I have to use other products in addition to get that affect.  Considering how expensive it is, it's not worth it.
"
"
I have longer curling hair that is thin. I live in a hot, humid climate and my hair is also frizzy.Deva Curl Angell Hyper-Allergic Conditioning Gel really helps my hair keep its curl, and also helps battle back the frizzies on humid days.If I want to use hot rollers, it is great at adding a bit of extra hold so that the additional curl from hot rollers will stay even longer in my hair.I only use a small amount of this product. I use it on towel-dried, damp hair after I have combed it out starting at the ends. It doesn't take much, so I find it very cost-effective.Highly recommended!~~>> ""I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather. Not screaming like the passengers in his cab."" <<

"
Like all of you, I've spent a gazillion dollars on hair products that never worked.  Hesitantly I purchased the Deva Curl line (the smallest size) because I figured, ""yeah, another gimmick.""  Let me tell you I absolutely LOVE this line and will never go back to even the most expensive products I've used from the salon!  My hair is VERY curly & tends to be frizzy and wirey.  After the first application I saw a tremendous difference!  I've used Deva Curl for a month now, and I get compliments on my hair all the time!  It looks healthy & not frizzy.  My curls are beautiful, smooth & defined.  Trust me - if you have curly or wavey hair this is the product for you!
"
"
I've been a hairdresser for over ten years, and when DevaCurl hit the market it changed the game! This Light Defining Gel is light enough to not weigh down soft, fine waves and strong enough to keep tighter curls in check. I'd start with a smaller amount and gradually add more product, depending on hairs length and thickness.
"
"
i bought the trial set to try for my 2kids curls.we absolutely luv the anGEL& when we can't afford the whole set,we can manage just fine with this.their dad is half black&im half Alaskan native so neither of us could use our products for our 2curly headed kids.our oldest has thick thick corse curls &the youngest has fine springs curls &this is the only product we've found that can be used on both curls(altho the oldest has shorter hair cause he's a boy&when he grows it out we need a heavier hold but when its short it works just fine)as long as the youngest dosnt go to sleep for an hour or 2 after her gets washed(perefer it to be done in the morning vs nite because it takes awhile 4their hair2 fully dry w/ or w/out products) it dosnt frizz or flaten like it used to with other curl lines &it don't look crunchy or too oily either.healthy shiny&springy all day long(naps included!)
"
"
someone recommended this product to me so I had to try it out and I love it for my 2 year old's hair.  She has cute little curly hair that when dry it is just below her shoulders. Smells great and doesn't leave her hair crunchy has a nice soft hold to it and controls the friz. This bottle is going to last a long time (we got the 12oz). I have thick wavy long hair and this didn't work on scrunching my waves but I figured it wouldn't because my hair is so long and thick. We will definitely order this again when our bottle runs out :)
"
"
I have used this product for years on my naturally curly hair and I LOVE  it! Use it sparingly, though, or it will be crunchy on your hair.
"
"
I found that it didn't dry completely soft--my hair was a little bit crunchy afterward.  It is a better product than regular gels but it isn't a miracle product.
"
"
My daughter has very curly hair and loves this product so it must be good. I gave it as a gift.  Smooth transaction.
"
"
Define curls
"
"
It is clear gel that is lighter than other products and doesn't leave my hair looking wet.
"
"
My friend swore by this gel, so I decided to give it a try. It doesn't help shape my curls at all, dries them out and makes my hair very dull. I've also been trying the Deva Curl conditioner which I have been equally unimpressed by. I have not found this line worth my money at all.

Love this gel.  It gives me hold without being overly crunchy.
"
"
I have tried so many gels and none compare to the Deva Curl Angell.  I've been using it for 2.5 years and I am still amazed at how good it is.  No crunchy feeling.  I get great shine, complete frizz control, and beautiful curl definition.
"
"
This gel left my hair very flat and frizzy. It definitley needs to be used with a curl enhancer and a volumizer, which is silly at this price point.  Also, it has a weird chemical smell.
"
"
Have been using this product since last summer.  The only product I've ever used that controls frizz without leaving my hair crunchy.  Give it a try-you won't be sorry.
"
"
Angell is a fabulous product for curly hair! We use it in our salon and clients LOVE it! Leaves the hair soft with defined curls.. Make sure you get the education from a DEVA certified stylists on ""how to use it"".... highly recommend this product![...]
"
"
Not a good product.
"
"
The product is great. The smell though is awful, so I stopped using it after only one use.

Wrong product

I have very thin shoulder length 2c/3a hair. I love the Light Defining Gel. It doesn't weight my hair down and produces the best curls I have ever had.My routine to achieve frizz free curls in FL humidity:1. Co wash with As I Am Coconut Cowash2. Use Shea Moisture Conditioner (any kind is fine) and rinse it completely out3. Use Renpure Whipped Coconut Leave In on the ends4. Rake a pea size amount of Cantu Moisturizing Curl Activator through hair and scrunch5. Mix 2 to 3 pumps of Deva Light Defining Gel with 1 pump it Deva MirrorCurls and glaze the top then the bottom of my hair with this mix.6. Take my microfiber towel and scrunch scrunch scrunch and scrunch.7. Let air dry or diffuse on a low setting if I'm in a rush.Simple quick and easy. No frizz
"
"
A quarter size amount of this light hold gel applied to my medium length soaking wet hair gives my curls a nice defining hold without causing crunchy curls or making my hair appear as though it is wet. I just have to be careful not to apply to much or it begins to weigh it down.
"
"
Nice product.  Works pretty good on my very fine wavy hair.  The only thing I don’t like is it makes it so my Hair is stuck together and I can’t run my fingers through it.  I like playing w my hair and this does not allow that.  My fingers get caught up in my hair.  Really does make Hair look great and stay frizz free.  Good curly girl method product.
"
"
I decided to try out the Light defining gel before ordering the Ultra defining gel. Some people prefer one or the other. I can say this gel did not suit well with my hair. For me, it controlled frizz well as long as I didn't touch my hair while it air dried. Seemed to get frizzy when I defused my hair though. Aside from that it felt like it dried my hair out a lot. I would do a deep conditioning treatment and my hair would feel great. Then I'd put this gel on in the shower and instantly it felt like the moisture left. The only way I can describe the texture is if I had washed my hair with alcohol....kinda squeaky and not flexible. I will continue buying deva curl products and trying out what works for me but Im disappointed I didn't just try out the ultra defining gel and saved the money on this product.
"
"
NO Frizz... leaving in Florida with curly hair is a challenge. Devacurl was easy to use and my curls lasted all day!
"
"
I love Devacurl products in general. I have extremely curly hair, but it's usually easy to reign in. I use the no-poo and conditioner. I also 'plop' my hair and air dry. This Devacurl product is less than I was hoping for. I was hoping it would have a light, soft hold but still keep my curls structured and smooth. It's light, it smells good, it's not crunchy, BUT it doesn't keep my curls in check. They separate and frizz after 3-4 hours.However, my daughter has wavy hair, and she uses it for beach waves with great success. I'm giving this 3 stars, because it may very well be what you're looking for depending on your hair type.
"
"
DevaCurl light defining hair gel works better for me than any other gel I have tried. Also, it has little scent compared to others. What scent it has I can tolerate which is saying something as that is one chief disqualifier I have for hair products. I have naturally curly hair which, with a good cut, will form soft ringlets all over. I just wash, put in the gel, scrunch, remove excess water by then carefully scrunching with a towel or paper towel, put in one bobby pin to keep up the topmost hair that would fall in my face and let it air dry on my drive to work. The gel works well enough that when I take the bobby pin out my hair stays out of my face all day yet my hair and curls are soft, defined ringlets. I am often stopped on the street by strangers who compliment my hair. I have tried lots of hair gels. This is worth a try.
"
"
I went to a stylist who specializes in curly hair and she uses DevaCurl products exclusively. She taught me how to use these products and I LOVE how my hair is, now. I'm always looking for bargains and the price here is significantly less than what I'd pay at a brick and mortar store like Ulta. That being said, this is the old packaging, so one imagines that the product is from before 2016. I haven't tried it yet, but will revise my review if the results are different from the newer product.
"
"
I don't have tight curls, it is mostly just wavy but I've always hated using mousse and gel because it is crunchy and gets tangled and leaves flakes.... NONE OF THAT WITH THIS!! I am so excited! It curled while using a diffuser  but the product dissolves as it drys, leaving no crunch or flaky product!My hair routine:I use a cleansing conditioner, like Wen and Renpure, rinsing it out with my hair upside down, brush it with a large comb and scrunch it, squeezing extra water out. Then I scrunch dry it some more, head still upside down, with a soft tshirt (a towel makes your hair frizzy). Then I put Deva Curl in when my hair was damp and let it air dry for a few minutes - then diffused it until completely dry. I'm so happy with this product!
"
"
OMGush I love it! The first moment I put it on my wet hair the smell isn’t great just like some reviews noted but it goes away, when your hair dries out you won’t be able to smell it al all. It left my hair feeling so amazing. I’m glad I was able to find it since I’ve been searching for a while. I do live in Colorado so cant say much about if it helps with freeziness but I do travel a lot to more humid climates and will ty it then and see.
"
"
I left a very long comment on some more diva curl products that I had purchased. Long story short I am absolutely in love. I did quite a bit of research before I purchased the products that I use and I suggest you do the same to know what best suits your hair type… But in the end this product is absolutely worth every penny in my opinion.  I would stick with Amazon choice and not an alternate seller to avoid getting at counterfeit product.  I’ve read some bad reviews and I can’t imagine that these girls are using the real thing.
"
"
Makes beautiful curls. As advertised, they are crunchy and shiny at first, then you gently scrunch and they are soft and don't look gelled at all. It's inconvenient that you have to wait a couple hours for your hair to look presentable after a shower, but it works. Hair isn't quite as nice after spritzing with water on the 2nd (or 3rd) day, but it doesn't look bad, which is something to say for curly hair.
"
"
I love this gel! I have naturally wavy hair, and all I do is scrunch some of this in it after I shower (or spray it down to get it damp) and it keeps my curls in tact all day. It's a little bit crunchy when my hair dries, but I just use my fingers to scrunch and loosen the curls and it looks great. I sometimes use a diffuser to dry my hair, but I typically let it dry naturally, so I like that I don't have to use heat for this to work well. Definitely a keeper!
"
"
I had so many expectations. I was already using the DevaCurl Volumizing Frizz-Free Foam which worked out great. This one though... it dried my hair like there's no tomorrow. Right after styling, my hair looked like some horrible plate of spaghetti. As much as I tried to break the famous ""cast"", strands stayed clumped together. It was meah...ok. But the second day I looked like a Halloween which with dry and spooky hair. Yes, yes, I did put it on my soaking wet hair and tried all sorts of variations in quantity but no, thank you. This goes back. For reference, I have B2 fine hair.
"
"
My hair is wavy/curly depending on weather conditions: wavy in dry climates and noticeably more curly in humid.  My hair is also very fine so I have difficulty finding after shampoo products that don't weigh my hair down.I like this product very much.  Enhances my curls even in a dry climate and does not weigh my hair down at all.
"
"
After trying many products over the years to help ""tame"" my somewhat unruly curly hair I have finally found one that works, thanks to my stylist.  I can now let my hair dry naturally without having to go through the chore of blow drying it straight to keep the kinks out.  It even works on days 2 and 3 - I just give my hair a slight spritz with water which seems to activate the gel again and, with the help of a diffuser on low.  Love this product!
"
"
Love this stuff. As a 3a/b curly, some products overwhelm my hair and some do nothing. This is a perfect balance. I apply it to sopping wet hair and plop before air drying. If I'm short on time, I'll put it on slightly damp hair. Next day refreshing is as simple as spritzing and scrunching with water. I'm not fully onboard the DevaCurl Fangirl Bandwagon yet because of the price, but this has been a good experience.
"
"
I'm half black and half white and I have very curly hair. This is one of the only affordable products that works on my hair! It does make my hair a little dry if I keep it in longer than two day though, so they hold isn't very well either. But if you are someone who washes and styles their hair every other day, then you will be great!
"
"
I recently dyed my hair and found it completely changed my texture. My once curly hair was more wavy and the curls wouldn't hold throughout the day. This product has been great with my hair and I'm finding that my curls are bouncy and lightweight.
"
"
I like this gel, and I've tried sooooo many products for styling curly hair. Its not a crispy finish, and any stiffness there is you can scrunch out with your hands during the drying process. I apply about a quarter size to my thin, fine, shoulder-length hair RIGHT after I shower (don't towel dry!!), and I usually let it air dry.
"
"
My fiance loves this stuff for her hair. She has super curly, hard to tame hair. It should be used alongside other devacurl products for the best results according to her. I will say her hair looks beautiful when she uses it, and I like the way it smells. Money well spent since it makes her happy.
"
"
This is the first product in a while that I have liked for my wavy mixed with curly hair in a humid climate.  I have the revive mist too that is nice for the second day but then my hair is more frizzy.  This works really well on my shoulder length, very fine hair, especially with the Deva diffuser.  I might agree with other reviews that it is the Deva diffuser that is key, not so much the product.  It did take some experimenting to find the right amount that worked best on my hair, I definitely need to use more than it says on the side of the package.
"
"
Smells wonderful. And more importantly defines my curls perfectly. Highly recommended, especially if you have problems with frizz/poofiness.Smell is a big thing for me. It isn’t girl or sweet — but instead unisex, which is a big thing for me as a guy. The notes are difficult to describe but trust me when I say it’s pure bliss.
"
"
I love this gel. I have way frizzy hair and unless I use hairspray no gel has been able to control it...until this! Lasts all day and isn't stiffning. The gel doesn't weigh my hair down at all. Worth every penny!
"
"
I got this for my daughter she has loose curls. I wanted something to make her curls more defined. Her hair tends to get frizzy. I’ve been using this regularly and so far I’ve been happy. I use along with the wave maker and finger coil a few pieces.
"
"
I’ve been buying this on Amazon for years now, and this last bottle has definitely been watered down. I had to use so much more product to get the same result as before. Not sure if I want to take that chance again.
"
"
I have thin 2c wavy hair, and this gel gives me plenty of curl definition and quite a bit of hold. Probably the perfect gel for curlier hair types (3/4).I also tried the Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel, and that gel is like pure magic for my hair. Not only does it make my wavy hair curly and voluminous, it actually holds for up to 3 days! So, if you are looking for extreme hold, buy the Ultra defining gel instead. This one is good for people who don't need super hold.
"
"
I have wavy, slightly curly hair and nothing tames it. I have bed head all day, every day. This gel works great. I only gave it 4 stars because I have to use a good amount of it in order to calm the frizz and it makes my hair slightly crunchy (which I’m not fond of) but I just scrunch the crunch out and it’s ok.
"
"
At long last, I found a product to replace my old favorite that was discontinued 6yrs ago. Smell is pleasant. It is light enough that I can scrunch a couple quarter sized squirts into my towel dried, super fine hair without losing body & having flat hair (a major feat). I get almost instant waves & curls, my hair isn't crazy crunchy. & the style lasts through out the day! Hallelujah!! (Please don't do what everyone else does & discontinue the product right after I found it. LOL)
"
"
Stupid curls are so hard to find the magic products for. This is it for me. I am Caucasian with cherub curls, chin length. A pump the size of a quarter, scrunch in to wet hair, let dry, then crunch the curls and BOOM I've got soft, touchable, shiny curls.
"
"
This is the same thing I have bought from my hair stylist.  The price is much much better!  This stuff does not make your hair feel stiff at all.  I get compliments on my curls when I use Deva Curl.
"
"
I expected more from the reviews.  It leaves a bit of sticky residue in your hair as the other products that are made to bring out the curl.  But, not as much.  I used it for a couple of months and saw no real difference to want to buy it again, especially at their price.
"
"
An all-around winner. The fragrance: so light and fresh, though it fades so it's not haunting you all day. The hold: super-light, directly opposite of the heavy non-DevaCurl products I had used for years. Turns out that my thick curls behave better with a light hold.
"
"
I just recently became a curly girl after many years of experiences that led to my resignation to uncontrolled hair.  Since being sulfate-free and using an appropriate conditioner provides most of the actual ""control"" for my corckicelli curls, this product adds the last part - having even more curl definition and moisture protection.  I still get a little weird about the curl cast that most (or all) gels produce, but experience now has shown me that it's no problem, once my hair is dry.  Scrunching really does release full, soft, shiny curls and gets rid of that awful, tight, wet look.
"
"
This product really makes my curls stand out without being stiff or crunchy. It’s best to get instructions from a curl specialist for the best results. Be sure to put it on hair that is wet. Just amazing!
"
"
I have lightly curly hair (aka white girl, thick but more than wavy) that is frizz prone. I love this stuff. It's the only reliable product I can trust my curls to when traveling for work. It lets me be low key with curls and still look professional.
"
"
Love the product, unfortunately, the bottle was open and some of the content dripped out. I'm not returning the product, just a heads up for future shipments.
"
"
Deva Curl is the only product I use in my hair.  It makes my hair shiny and bouncy and is not out of control.  Love Love Love this product.  buying on Amazon is cheaper than in the store.
"
"
DEVACURL LIGHT DEFINING GEL is my new favorite. When Pravada discontinued ""Curves, curl enhancer"", I begin my search for a new product.  Most gels are too heavy, sticky and strongly perfumed. DEVACURL LIGHT creates soft defined curls that can withstand Florida's humidity.  All the curly girls in my family are now using Light Defining Gel.
"
"
my wavy hair is actually less curly with this stuff. I must need the more stiff stuff, but it does smell good and doesn't get crunchy at all. I have curly hair underneath, and slightly wavy hair on my top layer. had to return.
"
"
The item came with a pump which is great but 1/3 of the product had spilled. The pump was loose.  And the pour spout was not taped. So both were leaking product.
"
"
I love this product!! I was disappointed when it came though because the bottle was open & leaked all over the box so I lost about a quarter of my product
"
"
This gel is the perfect weight for my Botticelli curls; it defines without too much stiffness. I use it mixed with a few drops of B'leave In after cleansing.  With only a fee clips to lift the roots and one to weigh down my bangs, my hair looks as if I walked out of a salon. Devacurls products are curly folks' best friends. Now that I have discovered them, I won't go back to those curl unfriendly products ever again.If your hair is more of the fractal type curly, the Ultra Defining gel might work better. But, this one is great for a softer type curl.
"
"
I was hesitant that a gel was out there that would not make my hair crunchy but this didn't!  I followed the directions and added gel to my wet hair and let air dry.  My curls were so soft and defined when my hair dried.  Love it!!  I use Deva Curl's decadence conditioner as well.  Their products are a game changer!
"
"
Love this!! My hair has some natural curl but I have to use product to help it out. This gel is nice and light, not sticky and doesn't dry hard or stiff. I use this and then heat w hair dryer on low and get great curl!
"
"
I have curly hair other products were just not working well. this works great
"
"
I've tried a lot, and this is the one. Apply to sopping wet hair, scrunch, put up in a towel, blow dry with a diffuser, and scrunch again when totally dry.
"
"
Not a huge fan. I was originally using the Kinky Curly Custard Gel which works great, BUT I'm tired of paying $30 for a 16oz. jar. I use Deva Curl No-Poo and Conditioner and I love them so I figured I would like the Defining gel. I decided to purchase the 12oz first for a trial run. If I liked it, I'd buy the 32oz later on.  No such luck. My hair may feel a little softer, but for something called 'Defining Gel' it doesn't do a great job defining my curls. I have loose and tight ringlet curls, but with this gel you can't really tell. I guess it's back to $30/per 16 oz. for me.
"
"
Been using Deva products for several years.  I always shop for price and this was the best. Love having the larger size to refill my smaller, more manageable containers.
"
"
The hold is nice, but I really hate the smell. I wish their products were more lightly scented or just had a different smell altogether
"
"
DevaCurl products helped me fall in love with and embrace my natural curls, so I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this one. I purchased it in a pinch when the Ultra Defining gel was unavailable and I knew the formula would be different than I was used to. Sadly, no matter what I tried I could not get the definition I was used to and would end up with a dry frizzy mess within hours.
"
"
I love this product and I have found that it works best for me if I leave a little conditioner in my hair before putting the gel in. My hair looks great & curls are unleashed.
"
"
Was not purchased by me but the girlfriend swears by this product for her curly hair.  Made a great xmas gift and she won't be switching to another shampoo/conditioner set any time soon.
"
"
I bought this for my mixed daughter - its a little drying but not like the other stuff we've used.
"
"
Love this stuff. I have curly hair and this is all I use most of the time as it is very light, it keeps my hair soft without resulting in crunch hair. If I use anything else, it is the Deva Curl SuperCream Coconut Hair Styler. Sometimes my hair is just a little frizzy on the top, after using the diffuser, and I will add a little of the SuperCream watered down to help with frizziness.
"
"
I don’t style my hair at all and this product keeps my hair from frizzing. Love it.
"
"
I am love this brand and it has totally changed my very curly hair. The light hold gel is probably my favorite product from them. I recommend the Deva products and the Deva hair cut to anyone i know with curls
"
"
Love this!  It's light enough to not make your hair sticky but holds it nicely for a day or two.
"
"
This is the best gel I’ve found. Holds curls, not sticky, and lasts
"
"
Good when used as specified, in reasonable weather.  Notice the label says, ""Light"" defining gel.  purchasedIn places like where I live, only tying your head on with a split firehose works.  No, really don't expect it hold your curls in winds that are regularly 30-45 mph.  If that's what you want, have your hair painted on.  It's GREAT used as described in the book, Curly Girls!
"
"
Is a product my daughter has been using for her curly hair. So she’s satisfied.
"
"
I love DevaCurl! I've been styling my curly hair with this for the past 2 years, and wish I had discovered it sooner. Also love that buying it on Amazon avoids the crowds and is cheaper than other in-store retailers! Definitely recommend!
"
"
Awesome gel that holds my curls perfectly.  It doesn't look sticky and you can still run my fingers through it.  Easy to apply and it has a nice clean fresh scent. Follow the directions and you will love this stuff.
"
"
I love this gel! I tried a small sample pack at first but found this one works perfectly for my curly hair without leaving it feeling crunchy. I highly recommend!
"
"
Not sure this is authentic, fairly thick doesn’t look like the product you tubers put in the hair in videos.
"
"
Bottle arrived dented and exploded. What a mess!
"
"
It makes my tight curls crunchy but some what more defined and 30 percent less frizz. Smell is ok
"
"
I really like this gel.  It's very light and doesn't leave your hair crunchy.  I have naturally wavy hair and this helps give it a little more curl and a longer lasting curl.  By the end of the day my curls tend to flop some and loose some of their bounce.  This has helped my curls last longer.  Has a nice light fragrance also.  I will definitely buy again.
"
"
Holds well, but my hair tangles so easily with this product
"
"
I think if you wash your hair every day this might be perfect for you.  I only wash my hair once a week and the fact that this leaves a tackiness in your hair makes it hard to comb out.  I am too worried about breaking off my hair and causing split ends to use this on a regular basis.  BUT it curls like nothing else I have ever used and eliminates the frizzies and fuzzies quite well.  I will use it occasionally.  My hair is thick, fine, and naturally dark blonde.
"
"
I've used this product for nearly a decade but this arrived watery and not the consistency it should be and the bottle was only 3/4 filled
"
"
I'm finally rocking my curl after straightening all these years. I've tried Ouidad, but Devacurl is the best!
"
"
This gel hold my curls perfectly.  I kind of wish they weren’t so crunchy sometimes,  but at least it’s not frizzy which I hate .  You can always scrunch your hair to try and get rid of the crunchiness .
"
"
I just love this product!  I have fine hair and it really works without being sticky!
"
"
Took a while to get the pump to work. I found that if I used the pump in a sink of water to get it going, it then works from then on in the Deva Curl.
"
"
Took a long time and when it did come bottle was leaking.  I like the product but delivery was bad.
"
"
LOVE THIS GELI have medium wavy hair, i was using heat daily hair dryer and flat ironmy hair is a bit damaged and looks frizzy when not straighten :( but this geleliminates frizz and really defines my curls without weighing it down
"
"
Works great
"
"
I wasn't a gel woman before, I went with serums, oils, or creams. But I decided to give this a try. It works about as well as those other products, and I'm happy for it to leave out some harmful things such as parabens. I'm not sure if I will keep buying it or not once I use up the first bottle, but if there is only 1 Deva Curl product I continue using, it will be this one.
"
"
Love this product and ALL Deva Curl products.
"
"
I don't find this much different than any other gel. Would buy a cheaper gel considering that.
"
"
I like that this gel doesn't weigh down your curls or make them crunchy. That being said, it isn't really anything special.
"
"
I love this stuff. It doesn't weigh my hair down at all and let's my hair be in its natural state. Which lets face it we have all been trying to master or curly hair since we were kids. Just use a small size on damp hair. Flip your hair upside down  do as little touching as possible and let it air dry. Don't touch it as much as you want too.
"
"
Great deal, good product for light control of hair.
"
"
After years of trying various products I am glad to have found this the Deva products. I tried it originally in a sample pack. This and the Deep conditioner are my favorite and the one thing that keeps my curly, frizzy hair under control enough that I can actually wear it down!Even when it is up, my hair looks shinier. It is a gel but it does not harden nor weigh down my hair.
"
"
I love this ! It tames my very frizzy and curly hair ! This product is a must buy!
"
"
I rarely write reviews but had to publicly state how much I HATED this product. It left my hair dull, dry, and feeling brittle.  In fact it did the very OPPOSITE of defining my curls.  Instead, I had wavy frizz.  I LOVE so many of the products in the Deva line but this one was a great disappointment.  I quickly returned it to Amazon.  I do believe this product works well for some people because, obviously, there are favorable reviews but the buyer needs to aware that they are taking a risk if they try it.
"
"
It's ok...I wish it had more hold
"
"
awesome
"
"
I am learning how to use the Devacurl products and have only used the gel twice but really like it.  My curls are nice and not frizzy.
"
"
really did not like this, zillions of white stuff coming out of my hair. Tried twice but could not stand the smell, alcohol like or something. threw away immediateley.
"
"
Good enough
"
"
I love this product.  Price here is better than any store
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Did nothing to curl my hair. If anything it made it more limp.
"
"
I think the Arc Angel gel works better for me.
"
"
I was really kind of shocked at how well this product (in conjunction with the styling cream) defined my curls. My hair was so soft immediately after use, and stayed that way for the week I left them in! AND it smelled awesome. Cool beans. Most natural products don't do that all of that.
"
"
Got this for my wife who has developed very wavy / curly hair after she had our two daughters. This is the only type she likes and uses....
"
"
This gel works wonderfully, holds curl without crunch.  I have thick, frizzy, long hair and end up having to use what equals two LARGE handfuls of this in my hair.  Next order I am going to try the ArcAngel which is supposed to be a stronger hold hoping I can use less and/or get better frizz control on ""second day"" hair.
"
"
I have curly hair that I air dry.  It helps to Define the curls
"
"
Does not control my edges like I hoped it would, but my curls look defined.
"
"
Good hold but drys my hair so I use it once a week.
"
"
I have very curly hair. Works fantastic, leave hair dog vs. crunchy..
"
"
A good standby when I am out of Quidad. Holds my curls.
"
"
I’ve been using this product for years. It provides the perfect amount of texture and curl definition. Just don’t touch it too much before your hair dries.
"
"
i think this is the most important part of the deva curl system.  i prefer this to the other ANgel for my fine to medium hair.  I have to let hair drip dry  completly with ANgel on before I shake out the curls.  If I don't wait before I shake, I get the gel stiff look rather than beach curls.
"
"
Perfect for my Jon Snow curls
"
"
Too watery for my hair.  The gel comes out thick but as soon as you touch it it turns to water.  Doesn't hold much at all.  I have fine and relatively thin hair.  Definitely would not work on thick hair!
"
"
I have 3B curls and I found this product to make my hair too ""crunchy"" and did not do much for frizz.
"
"
Instructions say to let air dry but I used with the devacurl diffuser and it still turned out great. I felt like with the gel, I got a good even coat all over instead of in globs like when I use mousse products. It dries a little crispy but not rock hard and softens up easily while still keeping the curl's form.
"
"
Did not work as well as the reviews said it would
"
"
My absolute FAVORITE gel! Devacurl is always my go to and this gel is a staple! Ordering was simple, easy and fast. You also can't beat the price!
"
"
The only gel that makes my curly hair look good without a hair dryer.
"
"
Perfect for controlling frizz. As the product states, it's light and easy to use to manage hair.
"
"
I have thin fine hair. This product makes the dinky waves in my hair wavier and fuller without any crunch or weighing my hair down.
"
"
great for my daughters curly hair
"
"
This is great stuff. A little goes a long way. Been using it for a few years. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Recommended
"
"
Deva Curl Angel defining gel has no competition - - this product is excellent. I have very curly hair so while I bought the light hold I prefer the heavier hold for going the distance.
"
"
Really a good, useful product that shapes hair without being sticky and too stiff.  Good for an active life.

my stylist first recommended Be-Leave gel.  But as my hair got healthier it was obvious I needed a little more, so I tried the light conditioning gel (formerly AnGell).  It has enhanced my curls and I couldn't be happier!
"
"
Love this stuff!  I received my order very quickly and it is a great product.
"
"
Have used this gel for years. I have curly, fine hair and this gives it a little weight. I love it.
"
"
Love Deva products
"
"
Sticky and stiff.  Gave it away.
"
"
I have wavy/loose curls. This holds everything in place without looking crispy. It looks and feels light and natural. Overall, I am very pleased.
"
"
If you have curly hair, you need this in your life.  My hair is always soft and frizz free after using this product.
"
"
Love this!
"
"
Great soft hold for men's straight hair.

My hairdresser used and suggested Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defining Gel, which I then ordered and which amazon just requested a review!  It was on the packing slip too.  Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on how one sees it), I was sent Devacare Arc Angel, which is a firm holding gel.  It's a different product.  However, wanting to try my new No Poo and the One conditioner with a Deva gel, I went ahead and tried it.  It's great.  I'm happy with the Deva Care product.  Maybe next time I'll try the Light Hold.
"
"
I love, love, love this gel! It's light and smells like grapes!
"
"
Hold my curls all day and never gets sticky.
"
"
Does a great job
"
"
Just ok for me
"
"
Pump broken when received, otherwise great product
"
"
Does refresh curls.  I am happy with it.
"
"
Not for me, left my hair feeling dry and hard. A waste of money for me.
"
"
Fragrance is great and such a good deal! Will definitely buy again.
"
"
Works great
"
"
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! I first bought it at my hair salon but I no longer go there so I looked it up on Amazon. I was so excited to see it on here & bought it right away but sadly it never showed up. :( Fortunately Amazon refunded my money & I pressed my luck & ordered again. It arrived the second time. I love Amazon and was really upset & annoyed that that happened.For the product, it's a great product! It's water based so you can use a lot without getting ""the wet look"". I have a lot of hair that's very frizzy, this is the only thing that tames my curls, other than straightening it.
"
"
Deva curl products have changed my curly hair totally. I love this gel for light hold and curl definition without weighing down, smells great, not sticky or crunchy.
"
"
I use this product on damp hair and it works fine. I didn't like the fact that I got only 24oz instead of 32oz. I didn't pay attention even though  it was advertised correctly. Don't be fooled...don't buy two 12 0z bottles, even with free shipping.
"
"
Love my DevaCurl products. I have never been a gel fan until I tried this. I love how it helps keep the frizz at bay.
"
"
The best product I’ve ever used for my naturally curly hair.
"
"
She will only use this and has only used this brand for a very long time
"
"
I'm not that impressed
"
"
Deva Curl product was doctor recommended. I have been using this for years and I love how well it works with my curly hair it makes it feel smooth and oh so soft. It’s a bit expensive but worth it. I am allergic to sulfa and Deva products are sulfa free. Deva works great for me!!!
"
"
This is a great product for curly and wavy hair--makes hair look polished without leaving it crunchy
"
"
Didn't work that well.. hair was frizzy and curls were not as defined as well as other products I've used.. maybe I need the heavier one..
"
"
First let me tell you that I have curly, but not kinky hair.  My curls are not real tight, but are more than just wavy.  I have found gels in the past that I like and then the company will go out of business.  Finally, I found this gel and I love it!  It's light weight and works great for my hair!
"
"
The lid was not tight and gel was all over in the box.
"
"
Not strong enough for my curls.  I should have returned it
"
"
I should've bought this product long ago. My curls are lovely, healthier and shiny! This product is so light and has only natural ingredients. You don't need to put too much into your hands then in your hair (make sure you scrunch with plenty of water instead of running through your curls) and dry either naturally or with a diffuser. Gorgeous!
"
"
I use this when I'm curling my hair. I recommend using this for adding curl and body to my hair.
"
"
This product is devoid of toxins that can dry or damage your curls. I have attempted various labels that claim to offer moisture n hold. This product goes beyond all my expectations .. It moisturizers n holds with shine.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Great product
"
"
It works like any other gel but I don't have the towel.
"
"
It made my hair the driest it’s ever been, it felt like my hair was breaking apart every time I touched it. I wouldn’t put this on a dog.
"
"
Great product for my curly hair!
"
"
Love this product!!! Great for those of us mixed women. This is the best, it can whip even 2nd day curls back in shape.
"
"
Product arrived on time and as described.
"
"
My hair loves this gel.  My hair curls are defined and soft
"
"
I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. I have to use this product because it is sulfa free and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product helps to hold my hairstyles all day long.
"
"
This is wonderful!
"
"
The curls that this gel helps create are fabulous and they are not hard and sticky curls. They are soft and bouncy and I absolutely love the stuff!
"
"
best brand for curly hair.  I just wash and condition w DevaCurl products, leave this in wet.  Scrunch it up when its mostly dry and I have soft super curly curls!
"
"
This gel holds firmly, but your hair is not stiff and hard.  It has a wonderful smell.  I have not used it on my natural hair, so I can not say how it does on your own hair.  However, I would recommend this product.
"
"
Love this stuff! I have waist length wavy hair and when I use this in the morning scrunched into my hair after shampoo (Low poo) and conditioner (one conditioner) it makes my waves beautiful!! Not hard like other products and helps tame the frizz!
"
"
This is the best gel I've found for curly hair. My hair would be so sad without it. Never gonna give it up.
"
"
this is a wonderful product.  Holds well and is perfect for my curls along with the other products from the deva line.  I bought the 12 oz just to try it, then after a few weeks ordered the 32 oz pump.
"
"
The best gel for my hair.
"
"
The best product for curls! I've been using this product for 5+ years. Love it!
"
"
Good hair product
"
"
Love Deva Curl.  This gel is the best product I have found so far for my curly, curly, fine hair.  It is soft, flexible and doesn't leave my hair feeling crunchy and hard.  Have been using it for 3 or 4 years now.
"
"
Would not recommend for thick / Asian hair as it does not provide enough hold. Would be better for fine hair.
"
"
I have wavy to curly hair and I was hoping this would add a little something to my curls. To say this nicely: it didn't. Complete waste of my time and money
"
"
This gel works well with my curly hair. I lime how it looks if I don't comb or brush it once it starts to dry.
"
"
It smells amazing, but doesn't really do much for my wavy hair. Still have puffy, frizzy waves that need to be bunned in order to become sleek. (I do not use heat or chemical dyes on my hair.)
"
"
it works
"
"
I use a lot of Deva Curl products and recommend this one for curls that just need a little extra umph. I have used some of their other curl products and they kinda weighed my hair down by the end of the day. I use with the bamboo silk sleek brilliance cream and it really makes my hair shine/ stay all day!
"
"
Weird, but this product seems to cause dandruff for me...?  What's with that?  My favorite Deva Curl products so far are Set It Free and Mister Right.  Love those.  And they didn't give me dandruff.  I wish I would have bought them again instead of trying this stuff.  But maybe it will be just right for you!
"
"
I love this gel because it gives me shiny beautiful curls with great hold. This product is used on wet hair, scrunching while applying, then either air dry or diffuse. The product sort of ""crystalizes"" on curls, then once it's dry I scrunch again and I am left with soft shiny well held curls.
"
"
Nothing works like deva curl. My curls are amazing since I started it.
"
"
I like it. It's light and don't leave my hair hard like other products.  I highly recommend
"
"
The product itself works great but the pump on my bottle does NOT work which is super inconvenient. Once I can replace that it’ll be 5 stars
"
"
I have fine hair that is quite long and this REALLY works!  It gives me VOLUME and waves that are wonderful.  I have gotten so many complements that I think I should buy stock in this company!
"
"
A+
"
"
I am in love with this product.  Love the way it makes my curls do what they were supposed to do and no frizz.
"
"
Works well on my wavy, not terribly curly, hair.  I use it while my hair is still dripping and then add a bit more after I've styled it.
"
"
A disappointment. Didn't hold my hair well at all. I was looking for a non drying gel for my long, coarse, wavy hair.
"
"
Arrived quick and the product rules. The best part of the gel is water activated. You can spray your hair with water next day and restyle.
"
"
I once before tried deva curl jail and hated it... this light hold is PERFECT
"
"
Devacurl is an AMAZING product for curly hair!!!
"
"
Easy to get delivered to our door
"
"
HUGE fan of deva curl. it's the only product that manages my fine but curly hair without the weight or side effect of frizz. the results are soft, touchable curls. i am a fan for life!
"
"
Good product.
"
"
A+
"
"
This product has really changed my life.. I love the way my curls look after using this.. I keep re-ordering it and use it daily.  Would recommend it to anyone with curly hair.
"
"
It was ok . It didn't really hold my hair is curly so I don't think I will be buying it again.
"
"
Love this stuff. It smells amazing, and works very well for curly hair.
"
"
I was afraid this would be too heavy for my hair, since hair products tend to leave my hair weighed down. But it works great, and holds my curls through the two days between washes.
"
"
This works as it should. I have ordered other Deva curl products from Amazon and have experienced products don't work as they seem.
"
"
I have been using this for about five years and I love it . Keeps the curl and never gets sticky feeling .
"
"
I'm happy to have received a genuine product at a lower cost than in store. I was worried this would be a fake, but its the exaxt same as the one i bought from ulta. This is the best get I've used, my curls are defined, frizz free, and have no crunch! I have fine and thin 2b/2c hair. I would recommend this to others with a similar hair type. It probably isn't enough hold for thicker curlier types though. This is my holy grail gel
"
"
This gel doesn't work well on my hair, which is very thick. I think it is designed more for fine hair.
"
"
WONDERFUL!! All the Deva products are exceptional. Wouldn't use anything else!
"
"
Love this stuff!! Smells so good and makes my waves and curls looks nice all day
"
"
Better than any other gel I've used in the past, and I've used A LOT!
"
"
I think this gel is pretty good.  I wish that more companies used essential oils instead of fragrance oils in their products.  This smells very strongly of some overly sweet fake fruit (grape juice?).  The fragrance does die off somewhat but if you are sensitive to scents , I may advise passing on this one.  As far as how it works- I have fine 3a curls and it does give me good definition.  I have to go lightly- maybe a dime size dollop is plenty.  It does elongate my curls a bit which I don't want but would be good for people that don't want shrinkage.  Overall I am realizing that I want volume over definition so this really doesn't serve my purpose.  Relative to other gels it is good.  The crunchiness that it dries with is easily scrunched out.
"
"
Good
"
"
It doesn't work any better than any other gel product for me.  It just costs more.  Will not be ordering again!!!  I was expecting something that worked better than regular gel.
"
"
I will not be without my Deva Curl Light Defining gel. This product works great. I also like the Low Poo and No Poo. And the conditioner.
"
"
Best product for curly hair bar none.
"
"
This gel works perfectly on my daughter's curly hair. Scents normally bother me but the lime scent is not bad.
"
"
It didn't work for my hair
"
"
great styling product for curly girls.  I have very thick curly hair and use a lot.  It doesn't leave hair stiff or sticky.  This is great stuff!
"
"
does a great job holding my hair, but I do tire of it feeling dirty all the time.
"
"
Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defining Gel works great for my curls and  holds up great.  I use about two teaspoons.
"
"
I ordered this per my hairdresser, and it lives up to her recommendations--curls are smooth and soft, not stiff.  GOOD
"
"
I like how light this gel is and that if I use in limited amounts it won't make my curls clump together. The only drawback is that it sometimes makes my hair feel a bit sticky and does nothing to limit frizziness.
"
"
Item came leaking. Some is missing from the bottle
"
"
I've used this product for a few years now and, for curly hair, I haven't found anything better. It doesn't weigh down your hair like some other anti-frizz serums and gels. I absolutely love it!
"
"
Great!
"
"
Great
"
"
I've been on the hunt for a good curly hair styling gel for years. I have type 3A/3B hair that's thin and dark brown.  I have trouble finding gel that it's too weak or too crunchy AND that doesn't flake white in my hair. The latter has been my biggest problem in finding a good hair product, everything seems to flake white in my hair.  Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defining Gel is the perfect gel for my hair.  It does initially dry crunchy, but part of the instructions include scrunching to ""break the cast"" after your hair has dried.  It did take a few days to figure out the right amount to use for my hair.  I am so glad to have found this product!
"
"
Made my hair really knotted. I liked the defined curls, but I didn't like the knots the gel created. I gave the gel a few months, but it wasn't like I expected. If you had a different hair type, it might be ok, but my looser curls just tend to end up in a mess with this  product.
"
"
This hair gel is great for curly locks!
"
"
I loved it! Makes my hair feel wonderful! Saves me loads of time. Looks great and makes me feels wonderful!
"
"
Love Deva Curl and get tons of compliments using this product.  Leave my conditioner in, throw the gel in and you are good to go!  Great curls!
"
"
Perfect for my curly hair. Have been using it for several years.
"
"
Works great, real Deva Curl product. If you have curly hair this product is a must have! Thy it if you haven't
"
"
This is the best gel I have ever used! Love all the deva curl products I've used! It's light and holds fabulously!!!
"
"
Love Deva Products
"
"
Light yet holds my curls. Will order again when this bottle is empty.
"
"
As most curly girls can agree, we’ve tried everything.  I know I have.  I’ve wasted so much money on products and have had to throw them away because they flat out, don’t work.  I started using Deva Curl Products a few years ago and although I occasionally switch to another brand due to the cost, I always come back to DEVA.  Like every great love, I come crawling back, BECAUSE IT’S THE ONE!  Its light, it leaves my hair shiny and it smells refreshing. I love the entire deva line.
"
"
product made my hair curly and not stiff like other hair products.  it arrived on time.  and, it is very well packaged.
"
"
I find it's too crispy.  The 2nd day is a tangled nightmare. It's counter-acting any moisturizing benefits. I don't like it any better than what I can purchase in drug store.
"
"
Good light hold. Combs out easily.  Curls are reactivated with a light misting of water.
"
"
Excellent non-cruchy, long hold, anti-frizz gel!
"
"
nicely priced! quick delivery. GREAT product
"
"
I use this to curl my hair when I let it dry naturally. Its not too gooey or stiff. The fragrance is pleasant.
"
"
Ok. Got to get used to it. Fast shipping
"
"
Great for curly hair
"
"
This stuff if amazing!
"
"
Great product for my very curly hair
"
"
i like this gentle product and the way it smells, but I think I prefer the Angel which  holds a little better.  I use this one when I will be using it for a few days in a row, so less buildup.
"
"
I have used this product many times before and loved the results. This particular bottle however has a much different consistency than other bottles I've used in the past. It seems as though it was completely watered down therefore the results are not what I am accustomed to.
"
"
Makes curls too crunchy!  Going back to my Moroccan Oil curling cream.
"
"
I am 30 and gave struggled with my wavey/curly hair. This keeps the Friz to a minimal and makes my curls soft and more ringlet
"
"
I will never go without this stuff. It makes all the difference. I use the shampoo and conditioner too but this gel is what makes my hair look amazing. The curls are to die for and I get compliments every single day from men and women. I had my hair super short for years because I hated my curly locks. I decided to let it grow out to see if I could stand it and I love my hair but only since I started using this line. It's pricey but so worth the money.
"
"
Soft and not crunchy
"
"
This is a great light weight gel.  I love all the Deva Curl products.  They have worked wonders on my wavy fine hair.  And being sulfate free they are especially easy on dyed hair.
"
"
Leaves my hair bouncy but be careful about putting too much near the roots. It will look to stiff if you do.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Amazing! I have curly hair that leans more towards wavy when I don't use any product. This stuff makes my curls look amazing while not feeling crunchy like typical gel or mousse.
"
"
Love this hair gel! Defines curls without leaving them feeling crunchy or stiff. I have no idea how that's possible since it feels crunchy while drying, but the result is always great.
"
"
I love love deva curl. I use it on my daughters hair and it is light, not sticky! I love this whole line!
"
"
Received well
"
"
Love! Use it with the ""plopping"" method to dry my hair and holds my curls wonderfully!
"

Great product, better price
"
"
I absolutely love this gel. My hair is super thick and coarse, not to mention very curly. Normally gel makes it look wet or crunchy, or fails to do anything at all. The Deva Curl gel can be ""scrunched"" when it dries, leaving my curls perfectly formed, nonfrizzy and definitely not crunchy-looking. I recommend this gel to anyone with frizzy curls--it really does work wonders. The only drawback I've found is that I have to use quite a bit (up to two palm-fulls!) to see results.
"
"
Use all the time.
"
"
I love this gel.  I have naturally curly hair and discovered this product through my hairdresser.  I use this gel on my wet hair, scrunch the curls, and let it dry naturally.  Then I gently break up the ""gel cast"" and my curls are soft and bouncy.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because when I received my order, the pump was broken so it is messy to get the gel out of the bottle.
"
"
Leaves my hair sticky and hard.
"
"
please don’t buy this from amazon. they scam you. it’s not the real devacurl. i know this because i bought the 3 oz light defining gel from ultra to test out to see if it really works well for my hair and it did , so i bought it on here . but it DRIES OUT YOUR HAIR SO BADLY! it does smell the same. but i tester both products on my hair . the one i bought from ulta and the one i bought from here (same item) and there was a MASSIVE DIFFERENCE! THE ONE FROM AMAZON WAS SO DRYING AND THE ONE FROM ULTA WAS MOISTURIZING and it made your curls pop out more. so please don’t buy this item from amazon. it’s a fake. they will scam you.
"
"
My daughter has really thick hair natural hair. She used other products but this seems to promote the curls best for her hair type. She uses the complete line. We love everything about how it works in her hair. It's a light hold that leaves her hair soft and spongy. The picture is of two weeks old about be washed hair. I just twisted hair as if she was going to lock it. I untwisted them previous day to make smaller.
"
"
Excellent gel
"
"
This product holds curls without making them greasy or crunchy.  I use the Nopoo and conditioner as well. Smells great, too
"
"
I love this stuff! It leaves my hair a little but crunchy in the beginning but eventually it goes away in a few hours. There are very few products that won't have a bit of a crunch. I use the No Poo shampoo and the conditioner that goes with this. I usually leave the conditioner in my hair and then add the light defining gel. Then I use my blow dryer to dry my hair (it takes too long to dry naturally) and I'm on my way. If you've tried the Kinky Curl system it's basically the same thing but it leaves your hair ALOT less crunchy.
"
"
best product !!.
"
"
My hair needs the more defining product or it becomes fuzzy. These products have a lovely scent, not overpowering like many products.
"
"
This is the best gel for curly hair.  Not too sticky and it doesn't leave a straw like feel to my hair.  I use deva products all the time and this one is a favorite for defining curls and getting rid of frizz.
"
"
Love the hold it gives to my curls even in between washing.  I won't use any thing else. Go Curls!
"
"
worked awesome on my hair! smells good too!
"
"
This is the best gel I've ever used for my curls, hands down. You can check out my youtube tutorial on how I use this product- [...]
"
"
I actually bought it for my mom, whom I am visiting. I tried it and now am going to buy for my hair. It leaves curls soft and not sticky.It is sulfate free and smells wonderful. I had a brazillian which is wearing off, and this is good for my hair.
"
"
This seller was quick with the transaction, quick with email info on shipping and tracking. My item was delivered in a timely manner. I would do business again with this seller. I also love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. Try it, you will love it!!!
"
"
Not like the Deva Curl I had purchased from the beauty store.  Not sure if the formula was changed by manufacture or if this is not authentic Deva Curl.  Bottle was also not filled all the way.
"
"
Awesome product! I use it all the time. It works for me better than any other product I have tried so far.
"
"
Best light, curl defining  product on the market.  It is made specifically for curly hair and tames the frizzies and doesn't get ""crispy""!!  I've been using this product for several years and I wouldn't use anything else.  It smells great too!!
"
"
Fantastic product--thank you!
"
"
The whole system is great. Love the product
"
"
Love this profuct
"
"
I always love ordering this product! and it always comes quickly and packed nicely. I will continue to order this.
"
"
Very nice product with a great scent, really accentuates natural curls without excessive drying that we get from other brands
"
"
It does define your curls. Won't flake or cause an itchy scalp. I have a sensitive scalp and a lot of hair products I can't use. But this I can and defines my curls all day..
"
"
Arrived well packaged! This gel is great.
"
"
This gel is very light, I can hardly tell it's in my hair.  I also purchased the shampoo and conditioner, and I love the whole set!  For those who like a heavy gel, this is not for you.  But for those with curls that just need a little control, this is perfect!
"
"
Great Seller! Great Purchase!  Thanks!!
"
"
These products are really the best out there for curly hair. I've spent thousands of dollars over 30 years and my hair has never looked better. I no longer use chemical straighteners becuase DevaCurl products make me love my natural curls.
"
"
It's nice, not sticky.
"
"
I have type 3 hair that is dry and coarse. This product is moisturizing and leaves no build up.  It has almost no scent.
"
"
I wrote a comment before about loving this product but that its hold was too strong and left my crunchy. I later realized that the product I received was not what was advertised in the pictures. I actually received the ultra defining Gel. I would not order from here unless your not picky about what you might get.
"
"
I use this gel daily along with the No Poo and One Condition products. I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz easily. I find that my curls hold well and frizz is reduced using these products. Highly recommended.
"
"
Amazing! I have curly hair but always has been frizzy and uneven curl. If you use the product as instructed ... OMG.... best bouncy curls of my life! I use in combo 3 pumps of the cocinar creme from devacurl and 1 pump of the gel (x3 for each section of hair) at 75 % dry add gel to areas needing definition and scrunch for less frizz and boy oh boy do I get more positive compliments than ever. So much easier than having to straighten or put my hair in a nasty frizzy pony tail! Love my hair and love this product
"
"
This product is awful. It's a knock off of the real thing and dried out my hair terribly. To the point of breaking off about 2 inches. Please pay attention to the seller when you're buying these products.
"
"
I just recently learned about this line of products and love them!  The gel works great on my hair texture.  I have 3C natural, curly hair.  I have struggled to find products that worked well that were not too heavy.  The key to this gel is to apply it to wet hair and NOT touch your hair until it is completely dry.  This will reduce the frizz.  Once the hair is completely dry scrunch it and unravel your curls if you like for more of a bounce.  My curls are not hard and are full of body.
"
"
Any DevaCurl product is worth the money if you love your curls and want to protect them and your hair.  Bottle had leaked about 20% in plastic bag it was in.
"
"
I love this gel. It feels light on my hair. I like the smell.smells so fresh and clean. Amazon has the best prices for the deva curl .
"
"
By far my favorite hair product. It's great that something exists that not only makes curls look amazing, but also doesn't pollute it with harsh chemicals.
"
"
I have 3b and 4b hair (Corkicelli and Corkscrew). I use Deva Curl No Poo and One Condition before using this gel. When I step out of the shower, I use a little bit of Kinky Curly Knot Today to hydrate my curls before applying the gel. I give the last scrunch with a quarter-like quantity of gel in my hands. I don’t touch AT ALL my curls while they’re drying (this is super important!). After dry, I scrunch in an upward motion and voilà! AMAZING VOLUME, AMAZING CURLS ALL DAY LONG!!
"
"
Smooth transaction...no problems...thanks!
"
"
its' ok but I feel; like it dries my hair
"
"
I am a big fan of the Deva Curl products, not so with the Deva Care. Light hold Defining Gel is useless. I will be throwing it away.
"
"
One of my routinely used products. Glad it is available through Amazon.
"
"
I think I purchased the wrong product.  I need the ultra curl
"
"
Stinks and has alcohol in it
"
"
I wanted to love this but my hair started breaking a bit (it is very long and I noticed many shorter hairs after I started using it) I didn't know whether to blame it on this product (based on other reviews) so I stopped using it just to be sure. Sorry!
"
"
What a curly girl needs.
"
"
Not great for high humidity
"
"
I was hoping for more of a waxy gel to smooth frizz. This makes my hair stiff and brittle to the touch.
"
"
Love soft light curl hold
"
"
It's a nice product and I like the way it works but I also like the Aveda curl definer and will probably just use that.
"
"
I have been using this product for a couple months along with DevaCurl No Poo Cleanser and DevaCurl One Condition Conditioner. Directly after using the No Poo Cleanser and One Condition Conditioner (while still in the shower, with my hair soaking wet) I flip my hair upside down and use a wide tooth comb to comb my hair. I then apply the Light Defining Gel while scrunching up my hair to squeeze out the water. I towel dry my hair with the DevaCurl Devatowel Anti Frizz Microfiber towel, however I don't think the type of towel actually makes a difference.I have naturally curly hair that has recently begun to lose some curl. I can definitely tell the curl is coming back, however DevaCurl makes my hair very frizzy. I think this is mostly due to the DevaCurl Light Defining Gel. I have noticed if I use the other DevaCurl products along with Aveda Be Burly Curl Enhancer my hair still holds curl better, but is less frizzy.
"
"
I'm so excited to use this product!! On the downside, this product came to me unsealed and some of the gel was seeping down the side of the bottle and in the box it came in.
"
"
My wife seems to like it alot.
"
"
If you're on the fence about the light vs. the ultra defining gel, I have tried both and for my hair type, I feel I had a much better result with the light version. I have permed and colored hair that frizzes at the slightest humidity, and hair drying has been a relearning for me. The light version gel gives each curl definition and upon drying, the fullness I wanted. The ultra defining gel must be too strong for my hair and either air drying or drying by diffuser, left me with the frizzes... I much prefer the light version of the defining gel. Love the Devacurl line!

With most gels, my hair is a tangled mess in the morning, and impossible to get a brush through. This stuff is no better.  I used to use Tressemme's Mega hold Gel, which allowed for great second day hair, but it made me break out. So does this Deva Curl product! I was able to isolate a common ingredient: VP Copolymer. So I searched high and low for a gel that doesn't have this, that will also let me re-style the next day. I found it!: Garnier Fructis Style Pure Clean Styling Gel, 6.80-Fluid Ounce. With this stuff, I can wet my hair brush, and gently glide it through my hair, starting at the ends, until it's all brushed and wet. I can add more gel at this point if it needs it. That is my easy and fast routine for 2nd and 3rd day hair that forms nice curls!By the way, I love the Deva Curl book, and styling routine. Also their hair dryer with the ""hand"" diffuser. Just not their gel!
"
"
Pros- felt like my hair dried a  little faster than when I use the Ouidad gel, Curls were pretty much defined on the first day..Cons- My hair felt dry and fried to the touch, my hair literally felt like a nest as it was drying and it smells like citronella (mosquito repellent).. I also judge by 2nd day hair.  2nd day hair curls were defined but dry looking. My stylist uses this and last night was the first time using it on me. I will never let her put this on my hair again and I can't wait to wash it out!
"
"
I'm not usually a gel person.  I have wavy,thick, med. length hair that I've tried to wear straight b/c I couldn't find a product that would give my wave nice definition without frizz. Because of the bulk of my hair, I have to use a good palm-size amount to get the effect I want. I first use a good leave in conditioner (serum makes my waves fall flatter and creates more frizz for me...I prefer a leave in like Nexus Headress) then the Angell. It creates such fantastic definition when I air dry.  I use the Mister Right from the line to revive the Angell in the morning, if I need to. This is totally worth the price.
"
"
Absolutely love DevaCurl hair products! Everything I've bought and used from DevaCurl has worked wonderfully. No complaints, worth the money.
"
"
I have straight thin hair most of my head, except little wave underneath. I like to scrunch my hair to create wave, because it saves time rather than curling and it seems to work with enough product. Thought I would give the ArcAngel gel a try along with DevaCurl Dryer & DevaFuser; to see if I get more wave! When compared with my regular dryer vs. DevaCurl dryer+diffuser and different combinations/method of product, I concluded that it is definitely the dryer that creates the awesome waves - not the gel Deva sells. I will post a comparison pic. so you can see for yourself! :)
"
"
Love this!!! It doesn't weigh your curls down like a lot of products and helps maintain the frizz that comes with curly hair!!
"
"
I had high hopes for this gel because of all the grear reviews on here and youtube, but I was disappointed. I have fine, thin 3b hair and needed a product that held my curls longer while I waited for wash day. I purchased Devacurl light defining gel hoping it would do just that-define my curls with a light, non crunchy hold. However, i have found that everytime I apply this gel my hair feels very dry, even straw-like afterwards. The hold was light, but too light for my needs. Maybe it is my hair texture that made it such a different experience, but I would not purchase this gel again.
"
"
There is something wrong!!! I have used this product from the salon before. But this one, ruined my hair!!!
"
"
I like this a lot.  I don't need a stiff gel and this doesn't flake.  I can use this to keep my curls in place without the stickiness or stiffness of hair spray.
"
"
Use it every day for curls all over!!
"
"
I received a sample of this product from my stylist - I found that it didn't give me as much volume as I would have liked, but it did give my hair a nice shine.  However, I would not pay money for this product - for the same price, you can get several bottles of Tressemme Bouncy Curls gel which seems to work just as well.
"
"
THANK YOU
"
"
I honestly believe you don't need this product.  It did me no justice and it leave my hair feeling hard.
"
"
very good
"
"
Best gel out there for curly hair!
"
"
Love this product. The pump was broken, but luckily I had one from my last shipment. Good product for curly hair in the PNW
"
"
I was skeptical that this product was authentic because of the price. I've purchased this before both at their salon and through their website, and it's $44 + tax both places. I ordered it here, ready to accept the possibility it was to good to be true, but I was very pleased this is the same product I've purchased before directly from DevaCurl. I've been using this product for about a year and it's completely transformed my hair! I use it about one every two weeks with a heat cap for 20 minutes, and my hair has come to life! It's shiny and soft makes my hair super manageable. I have 3c hair and I barely even have to detangle any more. My fingers slip right through. Totally worth it
"
"
I've been using DevaCurl products for the past 3 years and I love almost all of them. This product is one of my favorites. I use it as a deep conditioning for my super curly frizzy hair once a week. I apply it to my entire hair and let it sit for at least 30 minutes....sometimes longer, then I wash it out. It helps to keep the frizz at bay and to keep the moisture in my hair. I definitely recommend it for those with curly hair lacking moisture.
"
"
I have thick curly hair and got this product because I was hoping it would be an excellent moisturizer. It leaves a white residue throughout my hair and makes the texture sticky and strange. I tried it 5 different times, and then finally just threw it out.
"
"
Been trying it for 2 weeks now, and it's a ripoff it doesn't work at all, very poor quality. Don't buy this watered down white spew trying to pass for a high quality product. It's garbage!!
"
"
This product is hands down one of the best things I have ever fed my curls. Yes, it's on the pricier side, but it lasts ages.  I was very generous with my use of this product as a leave in conditioner multiple times a week, and the 16 oz size lasted me from March until August the following year (16 months or so). That's even with breast length (shoulder length with shrinkage) hair. My biracial 3b/3c curls have never been happier between this product and Shea Moisture's products. Heaven in Hair works as a super quick detangler as well (5 minutes or so even if I've been neglectful/busy). It defines my curls and hydrates like no other product I've used. Makes me less prone to resorting to heat damage from my straightener, and much more likely to enjoy my curls. Definitely will buy it again!
"
"
I swear by DevaCurl Heaven in Hair! I have to keep this on hand at ALL TIMES! It gives my hair the ultimate moisture. Do not rinse it out! Keep the product in your hair. You can use it both ways, but if you have dry curly hair like me, you’ll want to keep it in. Also, pro tip - order it on Amazon! You’ll save some $$$ because it’s def more expensive in store. This is literally my holygrail and I tell everyone about it because I love it sooo much. It also smells amazing so that’s a bonus.
"
"
This is a staple for managing my curly hair!  I won't be without it!  Once each week I comb out my curls, shampoo my scalp and saturate my hair with Heaven in Hair, cover with a shower cap for 10-30 minutes, rinse out in cool water and celebrate my curls!  I highly recommend this product for any curly hair pattern or style!
"
"
Love this conditioner/hair styling product.  Great for a monthly treatment  (wear it for 10 min under heat) or for regular conditioning.  I also use a dollop of it for my curly hair in humid weather and leave it in to control frizz.  It's hard to find a better product that is not heavy and oily and has the same effect on curly hair.
"
"
It's ok in a pinch (if I run out of other conditioners). I have medium length, wavy, to spiral curly hair that loves to frizz when dry :/I found that you have to use an awful lot of this product and it is quite expensive. To be honest I have tried several of the ""Deva Curl"" products and I really didn't care for any of them. Like all the other products I've tried they either leave your hair sticky, greasy (dirty looking) or crispy and I don't like any of those results. All I want is for my curls to look healthy; soft, bouncy and frizz free. I won't be spending top dollar for their product again.
"
"
The seller was great, received the item quickly.  The product was only so-so though.  I love Deva stuff, One Condition and Light Defining Gel are necessary to my life.  I need them.  I'm also very fond of No Poo, Mr. Right and Styling Cream.  I even buy Spray Gel for summer beach/pool season.  I wanted this to be heavy moisture and although it's ok, it's only ok, not the deep conditioning I was hoping for. If I have curly hair issues my go to brand is Deva and I'm willing to pay more for their products.  This is the first time they've let me down.

Deva products are fantastic! I recently had my daughter's hair analyzed and her curls 3B/C are looking much healthier using these products. Are they expensive? YES! But worth it.  This is a great deep conditioner, and has changed the texture of her very curly hair.  She is now getting compliments instead of crying about the frizz.
"
"
First thing is I don’t like the smell. The cream has a nice balanced texture it made my hair soft and manageable as long as it’s in it. Lol but when rinsed out it pretty much goes back to the same. But to be fair I don’t use it as often as it was recommended so that could be the reason I am not seeing the desired results. I will use it until it’s finished. But I am not going to buy it again.
"
"
Dried my hair out quite a bit.  I only used once.  I bought this because the Devacurl Supercream Coconut Curl Styler works so wonderfully and gives your curls texture without making them ""crunchy""  I threw the product away
"
"
I use all the Deva Products.  I have fairly thick, sometimes course hair with body to it.  I've found in the past that using products with more of a moisturizing, thickness to it works well for me.  I switched over to the No Poo shampoo and condition from Deva and have been purchasing it for about a year or so.  I love the products.  They make my hair soft and the smells great.  I'll continue to purchase and buy only this products.
"
"
I left this conditioner in my fine hair for 30 minutes as directed under a shower cap. After rinsing, it felt as if all of the moisture and strength had been dissolved from my hair. My hair is now extremely frizzy, breaking at the slightest and tangling 10x worse than it was before. Also, the smell of this product was extremely strong and lingered very intensely for about three days. I had high hopes for this product because I love DevaCurl but was left sorely disappointed. I plan to try it again in a month or so for a shorter amount of time, but we will see.
"
"
This stuff is very hydrating, but doesn't add any slip when washed out (at least in my 2C/3A fine hair). I always use the conditioner afterwards to add that slip back in. This product should probably be used by those with consistently dry hair in any season, and especially in the winter for those who live in a harsher climate like I do.
"
"
Usually a conditioner is suppose improve the feel, appearance and manageability of hair. This made my hair hard and brittle. I ended up using another conditioner afterwards to allow even my fingers through my hair without any pain. I will never buy it again. Waste of money.
"
"
Love the scent and works wonders for my dry curls. Leaves them feeling so soft. Also appreciate that I can use this product to refresh my curls
"
"
My hair is in the 4x range of curls and has always been tangly, even when I had a perm for 20 years of my life. But when my roommate introduced me to Heaven in Hair, it changed my life. It's fantastic at detangling, cut down my time by half for sure! I've tried a number of products for detangling, a Charles Worthington conditioner that got discontinued, Miss Jessie's Creme de la Curl (my previous standard), and this one has worked the best. I've been recommending this to everyone and definitely buy the big tub, it's worth it. If you have really long and/or thick hair, you'll probably also need it.
"
"
I use her as a leave-in after my nightly shower. Sleep with her overnight and BAM my hair is so good. When leaving in, however, dont add too much or else she hardens up. That being said, she goes a long way. Mine has lasted 10months!!! Yasss
"
"
Was extremely disappointed with the quality of the product! It hardly has a scent - a mere hint of a medical mint scent!Due to the texture of my hair being a 3B and a curly cube pattern it didn't due well with moisturizing hair or making it easier to detangle. I will finish using the product due to me spending my money doing so. But I won't be purchasing again!Devachan line is usually is pretty accurate with there product line - now since I didn't receive this from an actual devachan store and maybe the product was old as to sitting on the shelf and lost its potency this could also be a factor! Thumbs down for me....
"
"
I really like this conditioner. It has great slip and works well. It’s consistency is a little hard to apply but otherwise great.
"
"
It works okay I have used better leave in conditioners for my mixed girl curly hair. Also it smell strongly like chemicals which was the main reason I stopped using it.
"
"
I am in love with this product! It smells divine and really moisturizes my hair from root to tip. It even has some slip so I can rake my hands through my curly 4a hair! Perfection!
"
"
I've been using this as a leave-in for several years at the suggestion of Deva trained stylist. I combine it with one or more of: deva set it free, deva or Living Proof styling cream, Neuma Argan treatment or 100% Argan oil.  Helps tame frizz and calm bulk of my curly tresses. I still haven't tried new deva line/no need
"
"
I didn't like it, it's  really sticky and it left my hair drier then it was before and when I had to wash it off I had to put my conditioner in my hair to de tangle it and I was loosing my hair more then I normally do.
"
"
This conditioner leaves my daughters hair so stiff and dry.  i have tried it with heat and without and it just does not work.  This product is too expensive for this to happen.
"
"
Although this is pretty expensive, it is my favorite deep conditioning treatment.
"
"
Having fine 3B curls in which I wash every other day, left my hair dry and frizzy. With no plans to change my routine it was time to look for an intense moisturizing product.  I have been using Deva Heaven for 8 months and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! I was concerned that it would be too heavy for my hair, resulting in finer looking hair.  This has not been my experience!  Adding this product to my routine on a weekly basis gives me voluminous, beautifully defined soft curls with every use.
"
"
It took awhile to see what exactly I needed to do with this but after I discovered I needed to use it with a mix of another hair mask my hair has been extremely happy. On days I use it I only use the hair masks and nothing else and my hair is light and happy and wavy the way it should be.Its a must in my hair routine.
"
"
This is not a safe product for your hair. This has caused my hair to DRY OUT. Complete opposite of what is advertised. Also has caused me to have hair loss and a burning scalp. Made my hair like straw and it lost any shine it had as well.
"
"
Did not work for my daughter, not sure if we needed to detox her hair prior to using more natural products, she has thick curly hair and this product did not work for her
"
"
This is the only deep condition that I will use on my color treated curly hair!!  I leave it on overnight and rinse the next morning.  I also use it as a pre-conditioner before I color my hair.
"
"
Amazing  product , but do not over use as it will dry out your hair. I have african America hair 4c.
"
"
Slip for days!!!!!  My new fave.  The larger size is nice.  A little goes a long way.
"
"
This is now my go to. You may think it's expensive, but this product is my shampoo, conditioner, and styling product! Do yourself a favor and clean out your bathroom cabinets and but this. Highly recommended for all curlies!
"
"
Is a great product.  The packaging was well done however when we opened the plastic bag where was packaged we found it got splilled.  I suggest that the Deva Curl people implement a safety cap.
"
"
My sons both have extremely curly hair and we have used this product for the last ten years.  It is by far my favorite product for them and it smells wonderful.
"
"
I use other devacurl products and this one sucks!. My hair was extremely dry after using this product. It doesn’t moisturize your hair at all!
"
"
This is a great product for always-thirsty curly hair. A little goes a long way, and with some logistical planning, it's easy to incorporate into your morning shower routine a couple times a week. I have used it for years, but my first time purchasing from this seller. Very well packaged and promptly delivered.
"
"
This is an AMAZING deep conditioner. Heaven in hair is the perfect name for this product. Great slip, great smell and leaves your hair so soft and bouncy. I have 3C/4A hair and it works great for me. My daughter has 3C and works great on her hair also.
"
"
Loved this. I have 3C Low Porosity hair. It hydrated my hair to the point that I didn't want to rinse it out. I will def repurchase.
"
"
I love this stuff, and the large tub is worth the money, since a little bit goes a long way. I use it as conditioner, a hair mask (in the shower or overnight), and somes I use a little in addition to my styling product for extra frizz control.
"
"
First off, I actually like the smell of this product. Not very sure where the it smells bad thing is coming from. My issue is that after two tries my hair did not feel deeply conditioned.(There was a full 7 day gab between each try). It actually felt dry, drier than when I started. It felt dry as soon as I started putting it on my hair. I followed their instructions to the letter. And still this product just did not work for my hair. I did use the No-Poo first, then applied this by sectioning my hair. Each section was small. And I made sure to rub the product on the tips of my fingers to make sure it was mixed well before applying. 30 minutes later and I had a head full of wet, brittle hair. TWO tries!! I had to add Shea Butter oil to it to get my hair to become pliable enough to comb/detangle while this product was in. I am so very upset that I have a large amount left. I really just do not know if I want to try again. Their stylist said try doing it every other week. So I may try one last time. Otherwise said product is in the trash.P.S. Hair type: 4a,4b with a little 4c thrown in.
"
"
Love this!!!
"
"
I purchased this based on reviews and I found it lackluster. My hair felt dry after leaving it on for thirty minutes. The hair treatments I purchase in store leave my hair feeling more hydrated than this pricey product. I'll send it back shortly.
"
"
My hair was definitely softer when I do deep conditioning with my heated hair wrap! By the way, my hair type would rank around 4a or 4b.
"
"
My oldest daughter has super curly thick hair! We couldn't find anything to tame the knots and birds nest she would get! She uses a small amount daily and her hair is amazing!!!!
"
"
I normally dislike hair products from high-end salons, but I LOVE this product! I actually get my hair cut at the Devachan Salon here in NYC 2-3 times a year (I'd go more often but they are very expensive) and they do such a great job cutting curly hair but the other products from them I haven't cared much for so I was reluctant to try this product.  But they finally talked me into trying it because my hair is so dry.  I wish I had listened to them earlier because this made such a noticeable difference in the way my hair looked, it was really amazing!  My curls are softer and they almost never get that frizzy look.  I can now go 3-4 months without a haircut because my hair still looks bouncy and healthy and hydrated.  I'm hooked on this stuff.  And while it does seem expensive, you don't have to use very much so it lasts a LOT longer than you would expect.  I think mine lasted about 6 months before I needed to buy more.  If you have curly hair that tends to get dry I think you'll really be thrilled with this product.
"
"
my hair loves this. gives it great moisture
"
"
No me lo enviaron
"
"
I'm not quite sure if this stuff is real, it looks and smells like the real deal but I rather not take a chance after doing my research. I don't want to mess up my hair ! you guys are better of just paying full price for deva curl products , they sometimes have good deals on devacurl.com
"
"
LOVE AND SEEMS LIKE SALON PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE!!
"
"
I love this conditioning treatment, it's my second purchase. I recommend it to all curly girls!!
"
"
it smells like a pungent house hold cleaner! Im sending it back :(
"
"
This stuff is awesome!! Leaves your hair hydrated and smelling fresh
"
"
Not too bad not too good either. Can’t be compared with their amazing shampoos and the super creme
"
"
this is a decent conditioner.  I have others that I like better on my natural hair but this isn't bad.
"
"
This hair product is awesome when I use it on my daughter who has mixed hair in the shower.  Detangling her hair is easy!
"
"
After being a Deva client for awhile, we all know how expensive it can be to keep up with all of the products. This is honestly my only must have, can't live without. After using sulfate free shampoos and conditioners from the drugstore that don't break the bank, I put a couple tablespoon sized dollops of this is my soaking wet hair and I've got beautiful, frizz free, moisturized curls for days. Don't think twice, you'll love this. Personal note: Less is more!
"
"
Great once a week conditioner, more if your hair is dry. I have curly, but fine hair.  Love this stuff, makes a huge difference in my hair. Conditions, but not heavy, curls bounce. Delivery/packaging was great.
"
"
This is great on my hair.  Leaves it very soft and the curls are great.  Love Deva Curl products.  Best I have ever used on my hair (and I have tried every product out there).  Now use her line exclusively.
"
"
This should be mandatory for every person with naturally curly hair. If you have not tried it, the hair gods command thee!
"
"
Best hair products!
"
"
This product is very good at helping hair retain elasticity.
"
"
Oh yes, love this.
"
"
Different consistency from the one I bought from deva curl's website. The consistency reminds me cheap soap - very liquidy and weird. Didn't do much for my curls.
"
"
This leaves hair soft I live it....wish it wasn't so expensive.
"
"
Not my favorite product in the line but it does what it says it is supposed to.
"
"
The regular One Conditioner works better and detangles hair. This product felt like it did nothing. It was disappointing- I returned it.
"
"
Love this product! Very emoillant for curly dry hair.
"
"
I can't begin to express how much I love this stuff.  I use it as a leave in conditioner and it is amazing!  I used to have to use like five different products in my hair, but now I just use this.  I have very curly hair and it used to be impossible to tame, but not with this stuff!  I apply to wet hair after my shower and just let air dry and my curls are defined, shiny and bouncy!  I can barely go a day without it!
"
"
Use it every day. Fantastic
"
"
This is my go to conditioner to keep my curls in shape through the mean, dry winters.  I love it, just wish it weren't so pricy.
"
"
My daughter has curly hair and this product is fantastic for moisturizing and making those curls pop!
"
"
So hydrating and leaves hair soft and healthy.
"
"
I have couse, thick, wavy hair.  This is the best moisturizer I have ever found!  Bought the curly girl handbook and will never go straight again.  Finally, I LOVE MY HAIR.
"
"
Tried to use this as a moisture treatment, did not help my hair.
"
"
Leaves my hair very soft and conditioned with nice curl.

Deva products are amazing.  Great product if your curls need moisture.  Can use as a leave in or a deep treatment.
"
"
I have used DevaCurl for years so there is not much to rate. It works well with my naturally curly 3C hair.  I just wish the Heaven in Hair was not so expensive.
"
"
I use once a week to keep my curly hair moisturized, which helps reduce frizz.
"
"
My Daughter won't use any other hair care products & she has a ton of beautiful hair
"
"
Best product for curly hair!
"
"
Great product at a great price
"
"
Love Deva Curl and their leave-in treatment. They help my curly hair look good.
"
"
Its amazing the effect this has on my curls! they pop up everywhere without leaving that heavy residue feeling in my hair.  I love this stuff.
"
"
Im not to happy with the smell, but it works wonderful on my hair!!!!
"
"
Great conditioner.  i use once a week and hair never looked better.
"
"
A totally apt name for this product : it makes my hair so soft & really helps condition it & thus reduce frizz on my naturally curly hair .
"
"
This product leaves my hair feeling so soft and it smells so nice for  several days! My rebellious curls (3c) have calmed down and the frizz situation is under control. Also, you don't have to use a lot of the stuff, the texture makes it super easy to spread. So glad I tried this!!
"
"
Best treatment for curly hair! I mean best of the best! My hair looks feels silky with the right amount of Volume. I have being using Deca curl for many years already and i will recomended to anyone with curly hair
"
"
I bought this for myself and then for my niece.  She loved it so much that we went to Deva to get her hair cut - and she loved that too!
"
"
I like this product it keeps my curls
"
"
I use this as a special treat for my fraglile hair and my hair drinks it up.  I sometime even leave a bit in the hair to add some extra volume and to continue to norish my hair.  I highly recommned this product.
"
"
This makes my super thick curly hair softer and really helps in the detangling process.A little goes a long way and it smells divine.
"
"
I love the way it feels in my hair. It holds my curls really nicely without making them feel stiff or dry or heavy. This is a wonderful product.
"
"
love
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Makes my hair feel great. Smells funky. Still a 5 star.
"
"
This stuff actually makes your hair feel more dry than before you used it. I love deva products but not this one.
"
"
fantastic.  a must.
"
"
For anyone that needs moisture, this is a product you need.  I use this once per week.  I use a shower cap and towel and sit for at least 20 minutes.  My hair is much softer.
"
"
I am biracial and thought that this wouldn't meet all the needs that my hair type demands, but it really does meet all of them and more. This system has raised the bar for what I expect from my hair products. The only negative thing I can say about this product is that I am not personally the biggest fan of the smell, but the results are worth it.
"
"
I love this stuff.  It is great for my hair in the super dry and super cold area I live in.
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE
"
"
Love it! Now my hair knows what a real deep conditioning is.
"
"
I use this weekly for my DC, I will be getting it again... Happy that I have found this product.
"
"
Works great on my dry, thick, curly hair!
"
"
It works great adding it as a leave in conditioner. I have used it for more than a year already and I have noticed the difference in my curls.
"
"
Love it!!!
"
"
Delivered on time as promised. Well packaged also. I love this product as it has tamed my African American curly hair for the first. It was so much cheaper than at the Deva salon itself, or elsewhere for that matter.Will order again.
"
"
Love it!  Use it once a week keeps hair silky and soft!!
"
"
This conditioner is very moisturizing. You can tell a difference in your hair when you rinse it out. My curls seemed to respond better to the curl product I use after washing when I conditioned with the Heaven in Hair. I did not fall in love with all the Deva Curl products but I do love the No Poo and the Heaven in Hair.
"
"
I love this stuff very good when you use it over night!
"
"
It's great!!
"
"
I usually don't write a review but I feel like in this case, I have to caution people against this purchase.  My daughter has between 3C/4A hair and I have between 4A/4B hair and this product left our hair feeling very brittle and unmanageable.  It was a nightmare.  I remember getting this the first time and loving it but this last purchase was a nightmare....I'm assuming they did something different with the ingredients.  After applying the treatment I had to follow up and wash out and re-apply a different treatment plus conditioner.  For the money this cost, it is crazy that it would leave our hair as brittle, dry and unmanageable as it did.  I threw it out half used.  Good luck!!
"
"
I'm a dedicated devacurl product user ever since I had my hair done by a curly hair specialist at curls on 5th. I have corkscrew curls and alot of hair. This treatment really helps my curls feel softer, be more manageable and silky. It works best with the one conditioner combinded.
"
"
It's ok for a heavy conditioner. I love the smell and it does really moisturize. Houston's humid climate and super hard water combined with color treatments put my curly hair through the ringer so I have to treat my delicate hair with extra special care. I leave this product in over night for extra intensive help. Definitely worth adding to your curly hair arsenal. It is not the holy grail, but certainly helps keep the frizz at bay.
"
"
Amazing product for curly hair!! Love this stuff!!
"
"
Arrived on time & good experience
"
"
It's a good deep conditioner but for the price it is, it's not giving amazing results like my original deep conditioner, Shea Moisture Superfruit Complex Hair Masque.Upon original opening, it smelled like Comet Cleaner or something but the smell definitely isn't as strong once it goes on your hair and becomes more enjoyable. I probably won't repurchase unless I use all DevaCurl products only because I think this is a hair treatment made to work with their products.
"
"
Another great Deva Curl product. Since my hair is very think and curly I use this every time I condition my hair. A bit on the pricey side, but it is worth it!
"
"
I read a lot of reviews about this product before purchasing it, and I went with the bigger 16oz version because it was not that much cheaper for the small product. Now I'll admit I've only used this product once or twice and that was prior to me getting a Deva Cut so maybe that's why, but when I first used it I expected my hair to be super soft, and it was soft but didn't feel like I had any different results with Deva One Conditioner.  I have to try it now after my cut to see if there's a difference, but so far not that impressed
"
"
I wish I liked this product, especially considering the expensive price. The scent is terrible and overwhelming. I was hoping the strong fragrance would fade as my hair dried, but unfortunately it lingered. I think it may have conditioned my hair well, but because of the scent I don't like it enough to keep it, and am going to throw it away. Total bummer.
"
"
I actually use this product to style my coarse curly hair, and it's the best thing EVER for my curls. I am obsessed :)
"
"
It is just ok. Not bad not good. For me doesn't work. I was trying to use the Curly Girl Method for 3 months. I paid $165.00 for a hair cut. After that I was not satisfied and had to get a shorter haircut again (which a I did not want it). I mean I tried a lot of different things and my conclusion is that this product does not work for me beside that I got the same product from a different seller and put this one and the other one next to each other and clearly the one I got from this seller was water down, be aware.
"
"
Love this product leaves my hair feeling soft !
"
"
I absolutely love the product. It smells great and does a great job of keeping curly hair moisturized throughout the day.
"
"
I am a Deva FANATIC, but this product just doesn't do it for me. I swear to you, it dries my hair OUT more than it conditions. I use the Deva One Condition daily and a Kerestasse product for deep conditioning.
"
"
Love this, makes hair feel great and defines curls!
"
"
Best hair product! I used to have gel, mouse, hairspray and more. Now this is all I need!
"
"
Love it! so happy I bought it and received it quick!
"
"
Makes my hair incredibly soft! It's a great treatment to use.
"
"
I absolutely LOVE this product.  It leave my hair so soft.  I use it weekly.
"
"
this is by far the best leave in product for curly hair, i can't be without it!!
"
"
I thought this would really help soften my hair and it hasn't.
"
"
No better product line for curly hair. Leaves my hair shiny, beautiful and easy to style. I will definitely buy this product again. Arrived right on time.
"
"
Excellent natural hydrating cream for dry curly hair like mine. It hydrates and helps you style your curls in a very healthy way.
"
"
It leaves your hair so smooth and soft
"
"
THE BEST FOR CURLY HAIR!
"
"
This is thee best conditioner i have ever found for my daughter's kinky, curly locks!!! Thanks so much for the great deal!!
"
"
It's the product I expected.
"
"
received product in good condition, was as described.
"
"
OMG! The best, I love this product.
"
"
I cant say enough good things about Deva products!!  It makes curly hair very soft and defined!  It is a very superior product to anything else on the market!  Worth every dollar I spent!
"
"
I discovered after purchasing heaven in hair, that it it is not good for color treated hair (mind you my Devachan colorist was the person who recommended it to me). Nowhere on the package does it state that it is not good for color treated hair but after using it a few times and reading about the chemicals in it, you should not use it while color is on your hair.
"
"
I have been a Curly Girl for 5 weeks. I recently cut the remaining relaxed hair off after transitioning for 13 months. I am in love with several Deva Curl styling products, but this one completely lives up to it's name. Once a week I sleep with this conditioner in my hair overnight. It's amazing!
"
"
Tried it only once so the jury is still out. Most Deva Curl products I've tried are great, so have high hopes for this one.
"
"
I have long, medium-to-thick curly hair that wants to go all frizzy all the time.  This product works very well for me, it really helps control that frizz-factor and it smells great. I used to use a lot of it but I found that left a residue when my hair dries.  I use less of it now and it works much better.  I've been experimenting with different products this whole year since I gave up the flat-iron for the New Year this year.  What works well for me is a little bit of Biosilk Silk Therapy (not cheap but works great), then a little bit of Heaven in Hair and finally some Tresemme Super Hold hair spray.  I picked up one of the DevaCurl wacky looking diffusers and that works great.  I find that using the diffuser a little bit to get the drying process going then a little bit more of the hair spray and then letting it air dry the rest of the way helps to make the top part stand up a bit more instead of wanting to go flat.  Try your best to not, not, not touch your hair during the drying process - it really makes a big difference!  Oh, and for washing I use the DevaCurl No-Poo shampoo once a week but otherwise I just use conditioner (different kinds I haven't really settled on one brand yet).  So you can tell I'm definitely into the whole Curly Girl book thing but let me tell you it's worked great for me so far.  Hope this helps someone out there, it's what is working for me but surely everyone's hair is different.
"
"
I have not tried th product with heat but I did leave it in for 15 mins and it was okay but not super!
"
"
moistureizes my curls I use it as a leave in and as an intense moisture treatment.  Wish they had a bigger size!
"
"
I'm a blonde who went dark and then blonde again. Going blonde again required 6 pails of powdered bleach that left my hair feeling like a pile of sticky, broken hay. I genuinely though I might have to cut off the entire top layer of my hair. A work buddy recommended this brand, and, though I've only used this twice, it's made a big enough improvement (ie, my hair feels pretty much like hair again) that I actually wanted to review it so I could praise it. Good stuff!
"
"
Wonderful product!
"
"
My girls are biracial and I LOVE this stuff.  It really helps tame the wild, course, dry hair.  Deva Curl products are expensive, but worth it.
"
"
I use this conditioner every day - it is meant to be used as an intense moisture treatment, but I use it as regular conditioner and don't even rinse it all out - I leave some of it in with water as a leave-in conditioner for the whole day. I have very fine, frizz-prone curly hair, and this is the only product that keeps my curls in check all day long.
"
"
This product is like a miracle for my mixed race granddaughters hair.  She has very dry, course, thick, tight, frizzy, curly hair that becomes nappy and knotted just hanging on her head.  Since adding this to the three stage curly Deva no poo, one condition, Angell process, her hair is heavenly.  I apply it to her hair after cleansing or when it is dry, and it loosens up any tangles.  I have literally tossed the combs in the drawer and haven't needed to pull them out since I started adding this product to the process.  Thumbs up from everyone in the family because they can now get in the bathroom, don't have to wait hours to go anywhere, etc.
"
"
I've been using this product for just over 2 months, on the advice of a stylist at the Devachan Salon.  I made the mistake of highlighting my hair this past summer and I'm paying for it now in the form of dry sections of hair that don't want to curl :-(  The stylist at the salon used this product in conjunction with the One conditioner from the same line.  The results were impressive.  I, like most curly-haired girls, have several different curl patterns and some parts of my hair are straighter than others.  I was skeptical that anything would help to encourage better formed curls in those areas, but this combo did it.  Because some of my hair was damaged from the highlighting, I was advised to use Heaven in Hair as part of my daily routine.  It doesn't take much, so an 8-ounce jar has lasted me the full two months and I'm likely to get another 2 weeks out of it...and that's with daily use.  The tricks to maximizing the product are: 1) use it on sopping wet hair; 2) apply dime-sized dollops one at a time, drying your hands between applications; and 3) rub the dime-sized dollop between your hand and watch it magically increase in volume.  This is where most people mess up.  If you do this, you'll use less product, which results in a better look and saves you money in the end.  Occasionally, I add a little One conditioner to ""finish"" my hair in the shower and then comes the scrunching.  Flip your hair and scrunch like mad.  Never use a comb or a brush (I didn't believe it either, but it's true) and NEVER use a towel; instead blot or wrap with a t-shirt. Towels break curly hair and contribute to frizz. You can air dry, but I find that 10 mins under a dryer (table top or stand dryer, low-med setting) makes a huge difference in curl definition.  You can also use a diffuser on a low setting.  You don't want to blow the hair around, that would encourage frizz.  Sound like alot?  I thought so too, but in reality, I was doing just as much work to keep my naturally curly hair straight and I was paranoid about humidity, rain, etc.  I spent a ton of money on anti-frizz serums (silicone-based and really bad for your hair), anti-frizz shampoos and conditioners, gels, sprays, and so on and I STILL got frizz, even with my curly hair. Now, I laugh at the weather and give it not another thought.  No frizz here...ever.
"
"
Before using the mask my hair was a little dry on the ends, but when I tried this product, it left my hair unmanageable and tangled plus it smells bad.
"

This is by far the BEST deep conditioner I have tried thus far!!! During my transitioning period I have tried everything from Shea Moisture, Organix, Carol's Daughter, Mizani, Redken... You name it.. I've tried it.. I have attempted to make my own deep conditioners, but I always felt as though whatever I was using would not penetrate to the hair shaft. I was leery at first to try the product especially with it being on the expensive side, but it was the best $26.00 (at Ulta) I have ever spent. It's thick and creamy, I can tell this product is going to go a long way. I am very impressed of how this product was able to bring out the best in my hair. I was able to comb through my hair (with a wide tooth comb of course) to really work the product in. I have very thick, coarse hair, and it sucks up moisture like a vacuum. It is very difficult to keep my hair moisturized due to its texture, but ""Heaven in Hair"" truly brings out the best in my curly/wavy 4a hair. ***Be careful while using this product in the shower.. It will get very slippery***  Word of advice.. If you are in the same boat as I was as far as transitioning and trying to find a good deep conditioner, make sure you read the directions.. A true deep conditioner takes longer than 5 mins to condition your hair.. This particular product instructs you to leave it in 20-30 mins with a cap on (plastic cap is optional, but I used it for deeper penetration)

I have been using Deva products for a few years already, I get my hair done in their SoHo NYC salon.  They are just simply the best products for curly hair! My hair is more manageable, softer, I just can't say enough about these products.  I have thick curly hair and get many compliments.  I cheated this summer and used other drug store products (mainly due to the cost) and I paid the price 10 times over. My hair got so dried out from the drug store products.  I will NEVER stray from DEVA again.  THEY ARE THE BEST PRODUCTS FOR CURLY HAIR.!! TAKE IT FROM ME, I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING OUT THERE!!
"
"
Good but have to leave in.  I have curly/ wavy colored hair, and am always on the hunt for the magic frizz away products.  This ones good, but you have to leave it in once a week, and don't wash it out after application.  The one curl is just as good as a daily conditioner.  My favorite curl follow up is style prep from Aveda- keeps the curls perfect and together for at least 1-2 days.
"
"
It really hydrates your hair I use it once a week !
"
"
I have mostly 3B curls in the upper layers of my hair with more 3C below, and because of that difference, some parts of my hair hold a curl well while others tend to frizz. I use other Deva Curl products and love them, and after reading up on the benefits of deep conditioning for taming frizz, I decided to give Heaven in Hair a try.Well, let me say, this stuff is AWESOME. I applied it after washing my hair with No Poo and One Condition as usual, and I put on a shower cap to help hold in the moisture. After washing it out 25-30 minutes later, my hair felt softer than I had in ages, and the next day my curls looked really well-defined and MUCH less frizzy (and this was during a 90-degree, humid spell in July!). I have been using it once a week since then, and I cannot get over how much more manageable and healthy my hair is -- the frizzy factor is way down, and it does not get nearly as tangled as it used to.Like other reviewers, I admit that I initially balked at the price of this stuff, but like all the Deva products, it does such a good job that the cost is justified, and a little goes a long way -- I imagine the 16 oz. jar will last for several months, even using it weekly. If you're on the fence, I promise, it's worth it!
"
"
This stuff could make a 80 year old pack of crusty ramen look like Keri Russell's hair.I'll probably never stop buying this. If you're torn between products, get this one and start from there. My stylist also told me to not use a towel on my hair anymore, but to dry it with a cotton tshirt instead. The combination of these two things have improved my hair quality drastically.
"
"
This is the best conditioner I’ve found for very curly hair. Leaves it soft, curly, with little frizz. I use it about twice a week in rotation with a less expensive conditioner from Shea Moisture. I put it in toward the beginning of my shower, massage it in to clumps in “curly girl” fashion, and cover my hair with a shower cap. At the end of my shower I rinse out the conditioner with a trickle of cold water (the cold water rinse makes a big difference to frizz). Then gel, squeeze dry with a microfiber towel, and let it blow dry while I do everything else with a blow dryer that hangs from the wall near my sink. Curly hair care is not for the faint of heart! This is good stuff and works particularly well if you know the basic curly girl routine. Leaves hair soft with very little build-up in the hair.
"
"
Reminds me of marshmellows in consistency; very thick and creamy. Container was plenty enough to use for a weekly treatment. My hairdresser reccomended that I use a little in my hair and not rinse out, which I do in addition to the deep condisioning treatment. Doesnt leave my hair sticky or dry.
"
"
Deva curl products are the bomb!  This deep conditions my hair without weighing it down. My curls are smooth, refreshed, and shiny.  I recommend for anyone wanting their hair to look it's best.
"
"
The product looks like it would’ve been good, but upon opening it to use it, the safety seal that was suppose to be on it was missing. It was noticeable that it had been removed so don’t plan to use it because it could be defective now or used prior to receiving. Bummed because I was excited to use a new product, not used.
"
"
I'm so disappointed with this product.  I'm angry that I paid so much for it that I am leaving a review so another person does not get scammed with this product too.  It dried out my hair. I put three rounds of this product in and I couldn't even run my fingers through my hair.  It kept making knots form. Hair feels awful when it dries.  Not worth the price.  Does not condition.  This product is a sham.  No doubt.
"
"
I love Heaven In Hair, it is the best conditioner I've ever used. I am disappointed in the price increase which is fairly substantial. Hopefully they will hold off raising the price for at least 5 years.
"
"
I am a 4 a/b natural, and this gave me no added moisture, especially for the price.  It had minimal slip, and I made sure to clarify before using for the best results. It is ok as a leave in. I probably would not repurchase.
"
"
Didn’t like this product at all. Used it twice and don’t plan to use it again. The first time I thought I didn’t use it correctly so I gave it a second chance. It made my hair thick and completely opposite from soft. I could barely brush it. Had to use a leave in to see if it would make my hair a little better. I don’t recommend it.
"
"
Product makes my fine textured hair extremely coarse. Tried as stand alone and with other natural oils. Made no difference, my hair still felt like a Brillo pad after rinsing it out
"
"
Expensive but good moisturizing product. My curls look great after using this once a week.
"
"
Heaven in Hair Intense Moisture TreatmentI really like this product, it's soft, smooth, it smells fresh and clean and it does help lock in the moisture on my next day wash out. I also use the B-Leave in by Deva Curl for styling. I will continue to buy this product. I like all of the DevaCurl products, they all work well and leave my hair soft smelling fresh and clean and there is no sticky residue from any of the products or build up.
"
"
This stuff is really effective for my hair. Since its effectiveness may depend on your hair type and other products, for reference my hair is medium-long, fine, wavy-to-curly depending on the humidity, low porosity, and usually very dry on the ends. I don't use silicones or sulfates (although the conditioning cleansers like Deva's No-Poo don't work well for me), and very rarely use styling products.As a deep conditioner, used for an hour with a heat cap, this stuff really changes my hair for the better. It's not weighed down, has less fly-aways, feels flexible instead of brittle, and is shiny all the way down to the ends (something I've never managed with other conditioners).Another reviewer mentioned that this also works well as a leave-in, so I gave that a try, since I don't often have an hour to sit around in a heat cap. Most leave-ins either don't do much for my hair or leave it feeling coated. But a very small amount of this product--spread around in my hands and squeezed through sopping wet hair right out of the shower--was outstanding. Left even the ends shiny, didn't weigh it down, no coated look or feel.The only way this product didn't work so well for me was simply leaving it on for a few minutes in the shower before rinsing (without the extended heat cap treatment). Used that way, it seemed to just disappear without leaving any ""conditioned"" feel. But I don't really need to use it that way, even when I'm in a hurry, since it works so well as a leave-in. And as a bonus, using it as a leave-in is super economical, since such a small amount is needed.
"
"
Makes my overly dry hair nice and soft.  A little bit does the job so the jar will last some time for the price paid.
"
"
Amazing product, a must have! I love treating my hair with this product. I also started using a little bit as a leave in conditioner. 'My hair feels super soft after this treatment. Will continue to use this product.
"
"
Been using this for over 8 years and it's the best for curly hair! Conditions like no other, smells wonderful! Highly recommend!
"
"
At least, not for me.  Not worth the extra $$, & the one condition products leave my hair as soft as can be, considering I'm a curlygirl.  If I have time, leave in for 20 minutes- 1/2 or more before rinsing.  Why not?  And when it's warmer and sunny out, leaving it on and greeting myself to some Vitamin D son helps it to absorb and that's the ultimate curlygirl conditioner for me.
"
"
This is a wonderful product.I did not know how dry my hair was until I started to use this treatment.My hair is softer, silkier and the curls are more healthier and look more natural.I let this treatment sit in longer (about 60 minutes) under a plastic cap then wrap up in a towel for the warmth; rinse with cool water.My hair looks and feels amazing!!!
"
"
I LOVE this product! For people writing negative reviews and saying it doesn't work, keep in mind everyone's hair is different. As for me, a male with curly hair, I haven't found a better conditioner. If you follow the instructions for best results, you will get the best results! I love the way my hair looks and feels after using it.
"
"
Heaven is correct.I love the Deva products line and this leaves my curls soft and bouncy. A little goes a long way, so be careful not to put on too much.
"
"
This is the best.  I use it as a leave in for my curly hair.  It is my only styling product when I wear my hair curly.  I have been using this for 2-3 years and it is my can't live without product.
"
"
Great for when I need that little extra moisture protection for my hair. I use this after I have been at the lake in the sun all day.
"
"
very poor results.  Got better results from products costing less than half the price.
"
"
I love this product! My hair is naturally curly and in the winter when it's dry it gets extra frizzy. Thanks to the Heaven in Hair it's not anymore! I use it once a week in place of my normal conditioner. It arrived quickly after I ordered and was packaged well. The seller and the product are both wonderful.
"
"
I use it sometimes because I like the cool feeling but obviously not that much of a fan since I don't use it regularly.
"
"
This product is soooo good. It's moisturizing properties are long lasting without being greasy!
"
"
wonderful product for naturally curly hair
"
"
My wife and daughter love it. It excellently cares for and brings out their natural curls with no frizz at the ends!
"
"
I had super high hopes for that product on my natural curly hair. A coworker recommended it, and had great results on her curls. However, I am not very impressed.First thing is the smell… I can’t say scent because it is so strong and reminds me of the toilet bowl cleaner my mom used when I was a child. Not pleasant to my nose, and running around with that smell around my face all day long is not very desirable. I had read most reviews but no one ever complained about the smell… to the contrary. So I figure it is just me and the toilet bowl memories that are attached to the product now.As for performance… My hair doesn't look any different (perhaps I had used good products before that too?) and it feels not different. Maybe after a day or two I can see a difference? Someone wrote you have to grow with the product… Well… I will not toss it out quit yet… I will give it time, and my nose will become more forgiving over time I hope.So far, only 2 stars… but updates will come.
"
"
I love using this leave in conditioner during the summer months especially with all the swimming that I do.  I swim, rinse my hair and use this product.  My hair is soft and in great condition in spite of the effects of summer time heat, humidity and pool.
"
"
I love this mask! I have a portable mini heat-pad for my hair.  I put this in, put a shower cap on, apply the heat for 30 minutes, rinse...and soft silky, hair.  I use the entire Deva line and it's really transformed my hair.  Happy with this!
"
"
This is a great conditioner. I have very dry, brittle curly hair. This conditioner helps to bring a lot of moisture back into my hair.
"
"
I love this stuff. I have fine Botticelli curls that wilt if you just look at them wrong. I was using the light AnGel or whatever the new equivalent is, and it was just way too much for my hair. When I used the gel, I would always get crunchy curls, and I could never get second day curls to work with it. This stuff is a great solution. I get defined curls that are easy to revive the next day. I took the advice of a there reviewers to use this as a leave in. My hair needs a lot moisture, so I use no-poo  and then one condition, which I mostly leave in only getting it off my scalp. Then I separate my hair into three sections, rub a dime size amount into dry hands (this really helps) and apply it to the first section then repeat. I let it dry in my microfiber towel and air dry, and I get results for my moisturize-starved, fine, long curls.

My curl hair thanks me every time I put this in it! Absolutely amazing product!!
"
"
I have very large curly frizzy hair that is never soft. This product has made my hair so soft, yet it still curls. I can't stop touching it, which I know is bad. If you have hair like mine you'll love the product.
"
"
I have type 3a curly hair that is color treated and I like Deva Heaven in Hair, but only as a leave-in curl cream.  I have never found it to be helpful as a deep conditioner and I've experimented with leaving it in for various amounts of time.  It works great though to tame frizz and add definition to my curls.  I use it on partially dried hair (preferably with a t-shirt, not a towel) and just a small amount.  Too much weighs down the curls and leaves them limp.  I'll just lightly rake my fingers over the top and then rub that small amount between my hands before lightly running them over the curls.  Then I scrunch it in a dry t-shirt to get as much water out as possible.  I often follow it up the Deva light defining gel (formerly AnGEL).  I find this works pretty well, particularly on days that I shampoo.  I've recently started using a lighter styling cream for non-wash days or days that aren't particularly humid, but this one is my still very reliable.  I always bring it with me when I travel since I never know what to expect.
"
"
Super thick so you can tell right away it's good quality. I use all the devacurl products but my hair has never been so shiny and frizz free as when i used heaven in hair. I'm going to start using it every day. Highly recommend
"
"
I use this once a week and it helps my hairs texture tremendously
"
"
It is heavy, I take strands of just washed hair and condition it, in a few minutes I rinse it off lightly, my hair feels soft after this treatment. There is a fine line between hair being too heavily coated and just right.
"
"
Love this as a leave in conditioner.  Tames my frizzy curls even in the most humid of weather.
"
"
Thick, creamy and smells good and moisturizing but you can buy other brands that do they same like Neutrogena's deep conditioner.
"
"
I purchased this product with an understanding it would moisturize it. I have medium-coarse, colored hair and the product tends to leave my hair dry.
"
"
love this as a once or twice a week deep conditioner, smells great and leaves my hair well conditioned
"
"
The Perfect Treatment !
"
"
Outstanding conditioner! I use it 1-2 times per week depending on how dry my hair is.  You definitely don't want to use this every day.  The only down side is that this canister does not fit in my shower caddy.
"
"
Unfortunately for my 3C biracial (black/white) curls, this product couldn't deliver.  It smells and looks great, but when it's in my hair, it's almost sticky and impossible to detangle my locks.  I think that I need something with more moisture for my parched, thin curls.
"
"
My daughter loves it and works great!! Great price also!
"
"
HEAVEN IN HAIR is the BEST deep hair conditioner for curly hair on the market.I have been using this product for several year now and will not use anything else!!!!
"
"
Wow! Absolutely wonderful product. My hair lost its frizz when using regularly. Smells clean
"
"
Heaven, indeed!  I use this conditioner everyday, and even a little in the palm of your hand will keep the frizziness out of your hair!  The solution to frizzy hair!!
"
"
My hair LOVES this product!  I have 2c/3a course, thick hair and this has helped with the frizz immensely!  Leaves it so soft!
"
"
Great deep conditioner for my hair type. I have also used it as a leave in by just putting a dab on my ends.
"
"
A great, intensive conditioner that I can leave in in my curly hair.
"
"
The stuff is amazing and really moisturized my hair . It really is heaven in hair !
"
"
I like this product altho you have to rinse it out and it is not a leave in conditioner.  It has a really nice scent but it is heavy on the hair.  Works well on naturally curly hair.  I like it and recommend it.
"
"
This is a great product for curly hair. It takes awhile to figure out how to apply the right amount to get beautiful, hydrated curls.
"
"
Love this product, although pricey.
"
"
Very happy with this conditioner! It has made a big difference with the moister of my curl...my holy grail!
"
"
I have very curly hair which is extremely dry in the winter. This treatment has brought my hair back from the dead. I love it and highly recommend it.
"
"
Not a fan of this product, it makes my 4B natural hair feel hard. Maybe this product has more protein than my hair likes. I'll stick to my Giovanni Conditioner.
"
"
my hair loves it
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Super conditioning. I love this stuff. It quenches my dry curls; making them soft and awesome!
"
"
One of my favorite tried and true Deva products.  I use it every weekend when I throw my hair up in a bun.
"
"
love this while doing the curly girl method works good with my 4b textured hair
"
"
I love other DevaCurl products.  This is a nice moisturizer.
"
"
Amazing product, works great for curly hair that is colored too.  Scent could be better, but I can live without that.
"
"
Did not really do much for my hair.  Did not see the results of a good conditioner.
"
"
work in progress...
"
"
I love this product!  I have very long curly hair and this is a terrific addition to the other Deva products I now use.
"
"
I have tried several times this product and, like any other Deva product, leaves my curls dry.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Love love love this product!! Came on tume.
"
"
Smells great, kind of reminds me of key lime. It does provide a lot of moisture, but using too much product as once has caused more hair fall than normal for me.
"
"
This was slippery and didn't condition at all.  I love other DevaCurl products but not this one.
"
"
I have curly hair and I love this line of deva curly.  all you curly girls its a must have!!!!!!
"
"
Great product to control frizz! I put it on my hair after I get out of the shower (I don't rinse it out!)!
"
"
This is a great product and really puts the moisture back to get my hair curly.
"
"
Feels great
"
"
My Deva Concepts hairstylist of many years introduced me to this product. I ignored her for quite awhile because I found the price to be ridiculous. Then one day I agreed to a deep condition, and wow -- did my hair feel great after she finished with me; soft, hydrated and beautiful looking curls. I have gray/white tight curls and coils and my shoulder length hair is now cut medium short. If you have gray hair you know that it can be coarser than other colors. My gray hair also sucks up moisture through conditioners, pre-conditioners, leave-ins, butters, castor oil based products. I no longer have to use gel to keep my curls for 2-4 days, just refresh them with Devacurl Set It Free, and a little pomade to shape.This is a great deep conditioner that I use as an overnight pre-poo and a conditoner when washing once a week. I alternate with Jessicurl Deep Conditioner, another great product.
"
"
I use it after I clean with No Poo and don't rinse it out.
"
"
great product!
"
"
I have naturally very curly hair, and love Deva products.  Because my hair tends to be dry, I love this product.  I use it in the shower and love how my hair feels afterward.
"
"
Exactly what I expected thank you!
"
"
Wonderful product.
"
"
Great product. I use it as a leave in but pricey
"
"
Great moisturizer for dry hair!!!!
"
"
The best hair moisture treatment I have ever used!!
"
"
Best deep moisturizer
"
"
I actually had higher expectations of this stuff as I have read rave reviews on this stuff, deva curl, but it seems really just average! I have very curly hair and thick hair at that! My hair likes to poof alot. I guess I'll keep on my search for a hair product that keeps the poof away!
"
"
Fabulous moisturizer for my thick, porous, curly hair. I use this as both a leave in as well as a deep conditioner.
"
"
I was expecting a lot more moisture, i think its over-rated..will not be purchasing unless its a good buy, extremely overpriced.
"
"
This is a excellent product.It is easy to use and keep my hair healthy.
"
"
DEF NEEDED THIS INTHE BEGINING OF MY DEVACURL EXPERIENCE, NOW I USE IT MAY E ONE A WEEK JUST TO KEEP MY HAIR CURLY SHINEYH AND OH SO FAB!!
"
"
Everything was as posted.
"
"
Love this item.  Great Seller!  Thanks
"
"
I love this product and highly recommend for all those curly hair gals with very dry hair like mine. I have switched over to all natural products but my hair has been so damaged from dying, blow drying, mousse and gel that it is begging for moisture. This product has helped hydrate my hair and minimize frizz.
"
"
This is part of my hair care routine now and my hairdresser was happy to use this as an intensive conditioner after coloring my hair.It worked really well and I was at peace knowing that I was sticking to my sls and silicone free regime.
"
"
It gives my hair amazing curls. It's a must have.
"
"
I like the Gel so much better. I have very fine curly hair and the gel leaves the hair soft and the curls like ringlets. This is too sticky and it makes my hair look like its wet. I may be using too much and I probably should not use the gel with it so I am going to experiment a little and then let you all know.
"
"
I follow the Curly Girl method using Deva products, never used the HIH until I had a Deva cut where this product was used.  The stylist left some HIH in my hair and my curls were simply beautiful.  Now I use this as a deep conditioner treatment under the hair dryer, then I leave some in my hair & finish with the Styling Creme.  Fast shipping & authentic Deva product.
"
"
It is amazing how your hair changes with it!100% recommendedI leave it more than 30 minutes and then rinse itI am using it twice per week
"
"
5 star deep conditioning treatment at home. This product coats the curls and sets in to protect the curl from frizz and keeps the moisture locked.  It is easy to apply and smells wonderful. I have left it in for 30 minutes (no heat) twice a week and can already notice a difference . The stylist at the Déva Salon I go to said it looks great! A must have for curly dry hair.
"
"
Leaves your hair silky smooth. My daughter's curly natural hair is more defined when she uses it. Good product. Arrived timely.
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
original review: I got this because I really like all of the deva curl products, i use them exclusively now on my thick wavy/curly hair. I follow the book instructions pretty much - i wash hair 1x a week with no poo and condition and style a couple times in between. but this conditioner did not feel even like a conditioner. it felt like a mousse and was not at all moisturizing for my hair. my hair feels smooth if i use their every day conditioner ""one condition"", not with this, even after 1/2hour it was only a little smoother than before. i was expecting a deep conditioner, i don't really know what this is.update: ok, this product can work well if you figure out how to use it. i leave it in wet clean hair for 1/2 hr, then I HAVE to condition again briefly after rinsing it out. for me it somehow makes my hair porous, but if i follow with my regular conditioner (devacare one condition) i have really great silky, volumous hair. i've seen a lot of reviews on this on other sites and everyone that likes it usually uses it in conjunction with another product, like an oil. i think it works well if you follow with another product. i guess all products are like that, you have to figure out how it works best in your hair. unfortunately it took me a while but perhaps it will help you. i do like the deva line though because it leaves no residue after being rinsed out. so for a deep conditioner, this is unique.
"
"
I like it alot, though, honestly, can't say it's better for my hair than a couple of drugstore deep conditioners that I use.  Maybe in the long run it's better for my hair, since it has no sulphates.  Not sure I'll buy it again, but will defininitely use it up.
"
"
Hair feels heavenly.....
"
"
Perhaps my hair doesn't really like a lot of glycerin (which devacurl products are full of), but this didn't work as well as I hoped for my hair. It didn't leave it any more moisturized than my normal conditioner/cowash does. For reference, I have 2c/3a, fine/medium, medium porosity hair.
"
"
i have been using these products for a good amount of time, and it has truly saved my curly hair.
"
"
I have used Deva Curl for about a year, having heard about it from a previous co-worker, and I will use nothing else!
"
"
JUST GET THIS RIGHT NOW AND NEVER LOOK BACK.  it's so expensive, it's not in a convenient container, and it's hard to apply. IT DOES NOT MATTER.  your hair wants this, and it will say thank you in the form of non-frizzy, healthy shine.
"
"
This Deva Hair Intense Moisture Treatment revives dry, brittle hair back to a life and zeal!! It is incredibly moisturizing to hair that has been over washed, processed, colored, and zapped of it's luster and shine. It's like medicine to dry hair beginning for a renewing touch! So glad I discovered this and especially since I spend a lot of rime out in the summer and pool!
"
"
The BEST product ever for your natural curls!
"
"
I have kinky curly, african american, color treated hair and I was worried about breakage. I've been looking for a moisturizing deep conditioner and I've found it. My hair felt so soft after using it.
"
"
I'm giving this 3stars because my daughter likes it. We both have curly hair but I did not care for this product. It made my hair frizzy. My daughter leaves it in after using deva no poo and conditioner. She likes it.
"
"
Left my hair with a nice shine but difficult to manage when I left the conditioner in my hair and tried to comb it through. Overall smells great and brought life to my dull looking curls.
"
"
My hair is softer. I wish the print was easier to read.
"
"
Always my go-to-hair product. The only hair product that weighs my hair down and lasts 4 days. Love it!
"
"
As expected.  Good product.
"
"
Great product.
"
"
Great for really dry hair
"
"
Horrible !  smells awful !  I left it on ,  the result = dry  , dried out breaking mess.  It was hard to get out,  a drybrittle cement.  I used my conditioner and ugh,  still breaking dry,  more frizzy than ever !  I am furiousDo Not Buy this !  It will dry out and break your hair !
"
"
My 4C (really 4D or E or even F!) natural African American hair reacted very well to this conditioner. It smoothed the cuticles and gave a good shine and snap to my curls.

I bought this product after watching ""Mahogany Curls'"" Deva Curl Product review on YouTube.  Her review included the pros and cons of the product and because her hair is absolutely AMAZING, I decided to give the product a try, but not before I read all 12 reviews on Amazon, to get more information...lol.  I should tell you that I've been using and making all my deep conditioners from ingredients in my kitchen (mayonnaise, alvacado, egg yolk, greek yogurt, banana, pumpkin, etc.) and they've worked wonders on my hair.  That being said, I mixed together mayo, greek yogurt, pumpkin, and apple cider vinegar (ACV) and applied that to one side of my hair, and applied the Deva Curl Heaven In Hair, on the other side of my hair.  I covered my hair in a plastic cap and went to sleep. When I rinsed my hair, the next day, the Deva Curl side was MUCH softer and silkier than the side with the homemade conditioner, although the results of, the application, of the two conditioners were just the opposite; the APPLICATION of the homemade conditioner made my hair feel much softer than the APPLICATION of the Deva Curl.Note:  When I applied the Deva Curl Heaven In Hair, I followed the Amazon review that said to put a dime-sized amount in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together and watch the product expand.  She was so right, it was amazing and it saved me from wasting product unnecessarily.I plan to continue to use the Deva Curl Heaven In Hair in hopes that everytime I use it, my hair will improve more and more.

I have wavy/layered hair and style my hair to enhance those waves.  This conditioner made my hair very soft and limp, so much so that I had much less wave than usual.  It wasn't until I rewashed my hair - using my usual products - that my waves reappeared.  Also, it did not seem to detangle that well.  I like One Condition much, much better.  For those reasons, I would not recommend this product.  (Maybe for very curly hair the relaxing effect is good??)
"
"
I love this conditioner! I use Deva Curl No Poo and One Condition already, but after perming my hair it was a total mess. This hair mask brought my hair back to life! It smells amazing and is actually rather versatile. I have used it as a hair mask, a regular conditioner, and a leave in conditioner. It works great as all three and always makes my hair super soft and seriously reduces the ginormous halo of frizz that usually surrounds my head, leaving me with soft, wavy hair.
"
"
I have thin mid-length hair that is between curly and wavy.  I love this product!  I use it after shampooing and drying my hair with a cotton tshirt.  I put one scoop (two fingers into the jar) and then rub it around my hands and scrunch it into my hair.  I then continue to scrunch as my hair air-dries and I end up with great ringlets.  It last forever!  I've been using it for 8 months and I am only beginning to get to the bottom of the jar.
"
"
This product works really well to hydrate my curls when I put my hair in the plastic cap AND apply heat. Usually I just wrap my hair up in a plastic bag, tie it so it stays and go sit in the sun for 30 minutes.When I used it without applying heat, it did not worked as well.
"
"
I bought this in the store for twice the price (shame on me). Next time I know where to go.I have thick 4b afro textured hair that is protein sensitive. This product did not work for me as a deep conditioner nor as a regular conditioner. It was just not moisturizing enough and left my hair feeling pretty dry after I rinsed it out.However, I love this as a leave-in. It is the best leave-in I have ever used and I am a total product junkie so that is saying a lot. It smells a bit like cleaning products in my opinion but its not a bad smell. It leaves my hair moisturized and soft and I have to deep condition less. It also rubs in easily which is in contrast to many other leave-ins that leave white flakes when combined with other products.I use my shea-butter,coconut oil mixture on top of this for my twists with no problems. I highly recommend
"
"
I don't use this every day but I do use this when my hair needs a little more defining.  I really like it and I don't need to use a whole lot.  Excellent product.
"
"
The first time I used it I loved the smell but I was not really impressed but when I watched a video on someone using it I changed my opinion.  As instructed I took a small amount about the size of a dime and rubbed in between my hands before applying it to my wet hair.  I did not rinse any of it out and I did not use a gel but it really made a nice difference in my thick curly flyaway hair.  I do not use it as a moisturizer I use it more as a leave in conditioner alternately with Deva Curl One Conditioner.
"
"
THANK YOU
"
"
i use as a leave in/ wash and go and works awesome!
"
"
I love this conditioner, I believe it is the best product in the Deva hairline.  Only thing is that you have to be careful what you use it with or it will bead up on you.  Otherwise used along or washed out it is great!  BTW for people who do hair typing I am African American with extremely dry, thick, and course 3c(mostly)and 4a hair.
"
"
I discovered this product at my hairdresser's.  I am a 42 year old with a head of thick grey hair that I color and it is also naturally curly.  I apply a large amount of the Deva product, probably 2 to 3 scoops. I DO NOT RINSE.  Then I apply the Set Up and Above from Deva.  This may sound like a lot, but with hair like mine it is necessary.  I flip my hair, twist it in sections and blow dry with a diffuser.  Talk about curls!!!  And it keeps the frizz down too.  I would recommend giving this product a try.
"
"
It is excellent for every hair. Heaven in Hair moisturize your hair.
"

I have used Deva Curl and Care products for years, even when I used to straighten my hair, as my fine fragile locks just do better with No-Poo. When I initially tried this product, I was still routinely straightening my hair and felt like this didn't work well for me. I found my hair looked oilier and duller more quickly with this- so I opted for the Original No-Poo and the One conditioner instead, which was great! But since I have let me hair go more natural embracing my curls more often and reducing the amount of coloring on my hair- and now, I love this formula. Especially for letting my natural curls come back- it really has a good amount of moisture with a light texture. I like to sometimes leave a little bit in my hair before applying other creams and styling products and I have found that my natural hair- especially the areas not highlighted, are shiny, strong, my curls are frizz free and overall- it rocks! I need to leave the rest of my hair alone and stop the highlighting as the natural hair is so healthy and this product really nourishes the strands. I like that it has a little protein in it as well- I think that's a great feature for those that have fine, naturally curly hair prone to breakage.
"
"
Definitely not authentic. My previous  ottles were directly from DevaChan. The consistency of both gel and conditioner are thinner. Has it been watered down? Did they attempt to copy formula? It want make your hair fall out, and is better than drugstore brands, but genuine Deva, it is most definitely NOT A.
"
"
I had used Deva Curl for almost 2 years, trying to do the curly girl journey right. Funds ran low and I switched to a cheaper product (NYM). After almost 6 months without Deva Curl, I broke down and bought more. I used it twice before I figured out it didn't seem to work as well. Has the formula changed on this product? I will keep it and try again another time. I love the fragrance of the decadence.
"
"
Love this stuff!  Bring out your real curls folks. I have curly, not coily or wavey hair. There is a difference. I do think this works on curly or coily hair. Not sure about wavy. Anywhoooo. All the curls none of the frizz. Thanks!!
"
"
This shampoo works well on my wavy/curly hair without weighing it down.
"
"
I absolutely love this product! My granddaughter has thick curls that frizz all the time. I've tried so many other products but Devacurl is now the go to! No more frizz! And it smells wonderful even after days between washes. Thank you!
"

Well my hair is been very dried out I like it so far so good don’t wear your hair down helps my girls smells awesome

A great product for a great price. Works exactly as described.

Long time user of devacurl. Great product but its more expensive now.
"
"
Great product for curly hair.
"
"
Absolutely love this product.
"

Great deal!

Item arrived in a horrible condition. Product is not cheap so this is upsetting.
"
"
I never thought I had Curl until now using this product.
"
"
I have long 3c/4a/4b coily hair. My hair veers closer to the kinky side of curly and I face a daily challenge from frizz and dullness. Frizz aside (it is what it is), dullness is something I can address because its hard for type 4 hair to be and stay shiny. I want a product that keeps my curls looking their best.Pros:This makes my 4a/4b hair shinyThe smell is wonderfulThe shine lasts a few daysCons:The price. This is overprices oil sheenThe ingredients. Mineral oil is 1 of the top 5 ingredients. I'm sure its water soluble and made from high end ingredients, but after all the mineral oil Ra-ta-ta in the natural hair community I'm surprised to find it in this product.Overall:I will not repurchase. I can get products heavy (or light) with mineral oil and silicones anywhere for far less than $30. At the end of the day its just not worth the price tag.
"
"
I like the ingredients of the product and that it is light weight but I do not think the shine was that great nor did it last long especially for the $30 price. I have purchased a spray at Sally’s by Ion that the shine lasted all day and the cost was a lot cheaper.
"
"
I did like this product my hair tends to be very dry. But i did use to much and my hair looked greasy. But a little goes a long way. I would not use daily but do like this product
"
"
It smells funny. And it made my floor super slippery after a few sprays. Be careful!
"
"
It's ok...no matter how little I use it makes my ends look greasy with oil. Whether I used some in my hands or sprayed a little on....tried a few different ways. Basically I just don't use it now so it's kinda a waste. It has a neutral scent. Not bad, not good. I wouldn't buy again.
"
"
I have always had trouble with my curly hair, but this stuff makes my daily routine a lot simpler, and my curls look great.
"
"
I have been using this product for almost two months now and my hair change is fantastic. I love it, It helps with hydration, natural (non-greasy shine), super light and smells delicious
"
"
Excellent moisturizer
"
"
Horrible! Pump wasnt working and when I managed to use it I hated it. Smells bad and messed up my hair by making it dry. Returning!
"
"
I've tried many products considering I have frizzy/curly natural hair and all of deva curl products work amazing for me. Only took me almost 14 years to find a product I finally love

"
I have always had trouble with my curly hair, but this stuff makes my daily routine a lot simpler, and my curls look great.
"
"
I have been using this product for almost two months now and my hair change is fantastic. I love it, It helps with hydration, natural (non-greasy shine), super light and smells delicious
"
"
Excellent moisturizer
"
"
Horrible! Pump wasnt working and when I managed to use it I hated it. Smells bad and messed up my hair by making it dry. Returning!
"
"
I've tried many products considering I have frizzy/curly natural hair and all of deva curl products work amazing for me. Only took me almost 14 years to find a product I finally love
"
"
It’s ok, very expensive and my skin reacted to it the same day.
"
"
Works great always happy with the results of this product
"
"
Not greasy!
"
"
It smells good but I don’t see any benefits on my hair other than that
"
"
Absolutely love this oil. It makes my hair very soft and doesn’t dry it out or make it stiff !
"
"
No too heavy, great shine!
"
"
I don’t love the scent but not bad. Seems moisturizing so far
"
"
Make sure you apply to DRY hair. If it’s applied to even the slightest bit of damp hair it will make you look very greasy.
"
"
Amazing! Best moisturizer I ever used on my hair.
"
"
Cumplido y excelente producto
"
"
Like the what it does for my hair.
"
"
Leaves hair shiny & soft
"
"
Got it for my lass and she uses it now everyday she gets ready
"
"
Excellent, ships quickly
"
"
This oil smells great and is very light.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Didn't really seem to add much shine on moisture
"
"
Love the shine
"
"
Great!
"

This product replaced Mirrorcurls. It's awful; has a very strong tropical smell & does not perform as well.  Please bring back the Mirrorcurls!

First I want to say that if I could do half stars, I would give 4 and a half.This oil spray does what it is advertised to do. It helps to lock in moisture and keep frizz at bay.My hair: I have a mixture of 3b hair that is thick, and slightly coarse in areas. Due to where I live (on the middle of the US East coast), there is no such thing as no humidity. It is always 20% humidity or above. So my hair frizzes very easily.I used this oil with the new leave in conditioner and the supercream, and my curls look decent for about a day. I didn't put gel in them this time, which I had been doing before, to help maintained shape.What I found was that by the end of the day or into the second day, while my curls retained their shape, they were pretty frizzy. Which would then mean they had to be sprayed all over again.So this is where part of the points comes off. Obviously I need to use gel again. But with the amount of oil that I had to use on my hair, for the small bottle, it is too expensive. I would be better off going and getting a different thing of hair oil for less. I will maybe get 6 uses, 7 hopefully, because of how my hair works in where I live (plus thick coarse hair). so when I do use it, it is normally 10-13 sprays going on my hair. Much more than the recommended amount.Positive: it does help me to retain the shine in my hair.It smells goodNot a heavy oilSpray onCon's: priceySmall amount for the price
"
"
I love this new product. My curly hair is dry and tends to get frizzy in humid weather. I used a light quick mist on my wet hair. It kept my curls soft and hydrated all day. And I got a few compliments on the shine!
"
"
So glad I finally found this product! It's really helping add extra moisture and some shine to my dry, low porosity, color treated 2B/C hair. It's light and has a very mild, pleasant scent. Not too heavy to weigh down my waves/curls, but for me it seems to be a big 'missing link' in my curly hair care routine. I use this both on damp hair after the shower, and dry hair to help with 2nd & 3rd day curls. It helps reduce frizz, and I noticed my hair was feeling softer even after the first time I used it. It's a huge benefit for my hair, will absolutely buy this again! 5 big stars.
"
"
Didn't make my hair shiny: it made it limp and greasy looking. It actually took my curls away and made them limp.
"
"
I like this item because it gives a shine without being heavy or greasy. The best bet is to spray it in your hands and then work into the hair.
"
"
I do not like this oil, but do like devacurl products. There are other smoothing/ nourishing agents out there that do not destroy the lenses on my reading glasses/sunglasses every time I flip them up on my head!
"
"
Makes my hair soft and shiny when I apply this product to my hair
"
"
It is extremely oily.  The scent is awful.  Please don’t waste your money.
"
"
Does as promised with out being sticky or greasy. Just don't spray too much. Smells great.
"
"
I was looking for this item and found it cheaper in Amazon.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Good
"
"
Great shine, but seemed to fade after a couple of hours. Could be my hair, though - maybe too tough a challenge! Probably wonderful for shorter curly hair.
"
"
Great product nice silky curls

I do not believe that this was a genuine Deva Curl product that I received.  I have been using this product daily for years now,  I can't live without it.  What I received this time from buying on Amazon was a very watery product that smelled funny and does nothing for my hair.  I am very disappointed and will not be buying this on Amazon again.  I will stick with buying it in the stores where I know I am receiving the true product!!
"
"
When I had longer hair, this product was just ok.  Now that I have shorter hair it is my GO TO product.  I have always used Deva Curl gel (I mix it with water and spray it on my hair) but with this product I only have to use gel when my hair is wet.  I can go several days without washing because of this product.  It does not leave your hair feeling oily, it keeps down the frizz, and lasts all day.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't buy it in bulk, but I dont have to use much for it to work.
"
"
My hair isn't what one would say ""wow curly"" more waves, yet this product makes my hair curly and full. I love it. Third time.i bought this. The shampoo amd.conditioner is great as well. I have done hair- it adds volume
"
"
First of all let me say I love DEVA CURL!  I am a 55-year-old Caucasian female. I have nice curls that I have learned to embrace. (hair was straight as a board until I had a child!) My husband bought me the gel a few years ago and I loved it. I discovered the No Poo Shampoo and one conditioner and fell in love. But this one, Set It Free is A'mazing! I sleep with my hair in a top ponytail and spritz with water in the morning to re-activate curls. When I add this product, my curls are beautiful shiny ringlets!!!!! Never want to run out of this one!
"
"
Use sparingly! I saw a review posted of a reviewer using this in junction w/ the Devacurl spray gel, so I tried it out. But I used too much and put too much on my roots, so this started weighing my hair down a lot. It seems to be a leave in conditioner for my hair type (medium thick wavy frizzy bleached long), so I treat it as one. Once I use this up though, I won't be buying it again, I don't think it's necessary for my particular hair.
"
"
Still messing around with this product. I have wavy curls and it seems best to use after I style it on day one (shampoo day). If I use it on days I don't shampoo to refresh, it's too heavy/sticky.
"
"
I like this product but beware if you have fine curly hair, it can make it look greasy and really weigh your hair down. I mainly just use it on my ends and if I need more I apply to my hands and then distribute throughout the rest of my hair.
"
"
This is an excellent product! I use Set It Free the same way I use Mist-Er Right (which is also a good product)... but I like Set It Free even better!I use it on dry hair on my non-shampoo days. Works great to repair flat and unruly ""bed head."" Gives definition and helps control frizz. I spray a few pumps on my fingers then slide my fingers near my scalp to ""lift"" my short curls at the roots. Then I spray a bit more on my hands and scrunch it in.
"
"
This smells amazing and works great. I used it as a finishing spray on my daughter's hair today and it's made a huge difference in frizz and overall appearance of her curls. They look shinier. I plan on using it as a second and third day curl refresher also.
"
"
loved this. Hydrated my hair and smells soooo good. I dont recommend it for refeshing wash n goes because it hydrates so well I get frizzy at the top. I use it while doing my wash n go and it certainly takes hydration to the next level. Will repurchase. (3C High Porosity Hair)

This is the best curl spray! It adds moisture and a slight amount of tackiness to your hair, which ends up making the curls look great. Sometimes I combine it with Bumble and Bumble curl conscious spray if I want to tone down the tackiness a bit. Makes for a great curl revitalizer or just spritz it after showering. No crunchiness.
"
"
If you have curly hair and don't wash it every day (which most of us don't because curls tend to be dry), then you need this.  You spray it on your hair and scrunch, and your curls come back to life.  I think it's a wonderful product.
"
"
Great product to keep in your pocketbook to tame flyaways android brittle hair in winter.Gave some to my four-year-old granddaughter to tame flyaways.Works like a dream
"
"
I love several Deva Curl products like low poo and one condition but this one is really like nothing else out there. It gives my curls definition after I've slept on them over night. All I do is spray some water and then this to reactivate the curl. Not heavy or sticky and smells great! Love!
"
"
Love this stuff! I get my daughter's corkscrew curls wet with lavender water, spray this Set It Free in, then finish with a spray mix of water and Devacurl gel. Without Set It Free, her curls don't retain moisture nearly as long. Great product, affordable, lasts a long time, shipping was quick with no issues.
"
"
A little pricey for hair a hair product but it works well. I use it with the B’Leave-in miracle curl plumper. Love them and love them more toether.
"
"
i absolutely love love LOVE this product. It works amazing for my thick 3b/3c curls! I use it in combination of Ouidads Moisture Lock leave in conditioner. First I apply Ouidads once I step out of the shower, then I spray this product. My curls look and feel amazing! This spray also works beautifully with second and third day curls. I always have people wanting to touch my hair because they said it looks soooo beaituful lol. Highly recommend it
"
"
It really works to bring out curl & to keep frizz at bay. The bottle seems to last a long time. Good price for a quality hair product.
"
"
If you want to keep your curly hair from frizz after you apply your products, just spritz this spray and let it do its magic. Has a really light scent.
"
"
A little too sticky for me. I will admit that I am funny that way. I don't wear hair spray because of the sticky feeling. I have very thick curly hair though, so it took alot of product to work it through all of my hair.
"
"
This stuff is great, I just wish I didn't have to order it in such small quantities--I ordered two bottles in the 6 oz size after discovering that I love this when I tried it from the travel set. A little bit goes a long way ,it smells good (but not overpowering) and definitely makes my curls (which are looser/wavy) look more defined. My boyfriend even noticed that my hair looked ""amazing"" when I used this stuff. Recommended!
"
"
Love this product.  I've been using Deva Curl products for a couple years now. I use it to set my dried hair and to make my curls shinier and last longer before frizz sets in ( I live in humid S. Florida). Great on second day curls. My hair is fine and this product does not weigh it down. A little goes a long way.
"
"
I have curly hair and live in South Florida (humid!!!!). Deva Curl products live my hair frizz less, defined and soft...I have so many complements on my hair. Tip: Read the Deva Curl book to learn the right technique base on your curl type.
"
"
The only stuff that will hold my thick, curly hair.
"
"
This my favorite product by this brand! It’s really locks in moisture and separates curls! Not oily or sticky either. I some times  spray on when it’s a little sry and revive the curls. But best when hair is really wet!
"
"
doesn't work, leaves hair sticky and weighted down, no frizz control. might work for you, but my tight curly hair (Caucasian) just didn't care for it, going back to mousse.
"
"
item arrived on time. packaged adequately. product did not work for me as described. too wet to Define Curls as product description says it does. cannot recommend.
"
"
Amazing.. not stiff or hard on my hair
"
"
The result of this product was a total mess. Started off just okay. Was totally gross by the end of the day!
"
"
It completely changed my relationship with my curly hair. I receive so many compliments! My tip would be to use this on top of another leave in, since it's not very effective in moisturizing. I use it only for defining the curls, so I added one step to my process of washing my hair. I guarantee it's worthy the 2 minutes more you'll spend!
"
"
Like this product as a touch up or to calm down some frizz.  It is a light weight conditioning product.
"
"
Love this, use it on my wet hair straight out of the shower before wrapping with tshirt than air drying. End up with no frizz on my super wavy hair. I mix it with other products also and always get good results.
"
"
Makes my hair feel dirty. I stopped using after a few days. My hair was dull and felt like I hadn't washed it in weeks
"
"
Love, love, love! It stretched out and separated my curls. It made my thinner curls appear fuller. Most of all, my hair dried soft with elasticity, bounce and shine. Looks better dry than ever before. Remoistening my hair throughout the day is a thing of the past.
"
"
I love deva curl
"
"
I was an adult before I discovered Deva Curl products and I wish I would've had them in my life sooner! They are the only products that work on my curly hair! No frizz and no crust! I recommend these products to every person I know who has curly hair, male or female!
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and my hairdresser recommended this line of products to me. While I do not like the Deva Curl shampoo or conditioner (they dried my hair out and I did not like the smell of the shampoo and especially did not like the smell of the conditioner), I love the Set it Free and was so happy to find it on Amazon as it was much less expensive that what the salon was charging for a much larger bottle! I just spritz a little bit onto my damp hair, scrunch my curls and dry with a diffuser on a warm then cool setting until the dampness is gone and then let it dry naturally the rest of the way. I have had more people comment on my curls since I began using this product and they look so much more natural. It does not take a lot of the product to get the curls defined. The diffuser is an important tool as well and not drying the hair all the way as this causes frizziness. Continue to scrunch while diffusing the hair. I think this a a great, lightweight product that I would recommend anyone with curly hair to try. It has the look and consistency of spraying milk into your hair = light.
"
"
For my 3b hair:Pros:- Really does make 2nd or 3rd day curls look closer to what they looked like on wash day.- Not crunchy.- Not oily.- Smells good.Cons:- Expensive.- Small quantity.- Not as much of a moisturizer as I'd like. While it makes the curls snap to, it's more like a really light gel than a moisturizer, in my opinion.
"
"
My hair did not smell or feel fresh after washing.  I believe there must be an adjustment period, but I could not wait it out.  It did; however, eliminate the frizz, but my hair looked dirty at the crown.  Not the right product for me.
"
"
These is a great product for naturally curly hair - HOWEVER, watch the price.  If it's over $18 just go to the store and pick it up.  If it's $15 and on Prime Shipping then it's worth the purchase.I do not recommend the Deva daily conditioner but I do like the shampoo.
"
"
I use this product on the day after I wash my hair.  Instead of rewetting the hair to bring the curl back, simply spray this on and scrunch.  The scent seems sweet at first but totally disapates after a few minutes.
"
"
love this product.  been using for a few years.  gives my wavy hair ringlets
"
"
I have curly hair and On days I don't wash and recondition i need to tame the mane...and this does it for me!
"
"
I've tried a lot of products for curly hair and find this works best for me. I use this after the shower or on dry hair and it works great. I find it works even better when you pair it with the cream but either way it's fabulous.
"
"
deva system is great
"
"
All DevaCurl products are great for natural curly heads. Love how it cares for my 3B hair.
"
"
Works good with the other Deva product.
"
"
This is one of my favorite go to products. I have a friend who doesn't have curly/wavy hair and she even loves this.
"
"
Works well without build up and price much better than a salon.
"
"
Can't go wrong with Deva Curl when you have curly hair! A little water and some of this spray is all I need for my hair to look great even if my hair is dirty, dead, wet, frizzy, this spray works like magic.
"
"
This product is great! It makes your hair smooth and is not oily. I use this to spruce up my hair after using the Deva no-poo and conditioner. It is amazing for your hair and worth the cost!
"
"
My has been using the devaCurl products for over a year and love them.
"
"
I have tried many products. But I absolutely fell in love with this spray. It gives my curls a nice definition without the crunchiness. I also use it for 2nd day curls. Love, love, love this product.
"
"
didn't do as described.
"
"
Love it for my curls!
"
"
DC products destroyed my hair and scalp. Please use caution if considering any DC products!
"
"
bought this for my girlfriend, and she said she liked and will buy again!
"
"
I really love this stuff--It do two light sprays, one to the surface of my hair, then one with my head flipped over. I do this after doing the No-Poo, One Condition (one pump in shower, one drop as leave-in), then 1/2-1 pump of the Light Defining Gel before drip-drying. I apply this once my hair is almost to completely dry. I will sometimes repeat around the 3rd day (I wash twice weekly). I will say that over-applying will definitely lead to some weird dandruff-like flakes, though. It does have a strong smell, but I personally like it, as does my boyfriend. It's not so much a styling product, as a maintainer (prevents frizz) and refresher (helps my waves/curls hang together again after a couple of days), so keep that in mind. I have fine/thin 3a-3b curls.
"
"
Great curl and smooths the flyaways. Don't go too heavy though, or your hair will be left feeling weighed down. A little goes a long way.
"
"
Best curl product I have ever purchased. Leaves my curls soft and controlled. Best of both worlds!!!
"
"
Love this stuff
"
"
Deva Curl brand has excellent products for people with curls - both natural and permed! This product helps keep the frizz away - easy to spray on and smells great, too!
"
"
great for touch up during the day
"
"
This does absolute wonders for my hair on those humid summer days!
"
"
perfect for my hair
"
"
Excellent product for curly hair.  It arrived in the time frame given, and without damage.I would order it again.
"
"
Have used this product for several years now on my curly hair.
"
"
Great product. I can't really explain how I use it or why I need it but I would hate to not have it.
"
"
Great product for curly heads!  This product sprayed into hands, rubbed together then scrunched through out hair, maintains curl without stiffness.
"
"
it really works ,leaving your  hair soft and managable
"
"
I'm not crazy about the smell. It's moisturizing but not my favorite product. It refreshed my hair decently though
"
"
This is a great product for your next day hair. All you need to do is spray it and your off. I highly recommend this product for people who have curly hair.
"
"
Item arrived quickly and as described. This product is all I use now on my curly hair. Keeps it manageable and soft - no crunch, just curls!
"
"
Best product EVER!  My husband and kids used it ALL!
"
"
This spray is nice. It helps with keeping my curls from getting frizzy.
"
"
My hair does not like this sticky product.
"
"
As described
"
"
I love this product! It's especially good to use on day 2 when you don't shampoo but want to refresh your curls.
"
"
I really like Devacurl products. I've stopped purchasing it, however; it's just too expensive.
"
"
Great product.
"
"
Best thing to help her keep her hair in line when curling or straightening.
"
"
This works to re-define my curls aftwr I've been out in the elements. It doesn't leave my hair stiff like some of the other products.
"
"
This leave-in conditioner is the perfect solution to ""the frizzies.""
"
"
I use it on my daughters curly hair. It transforms her hair so beautifully. It doesn't leave a residue. It only takes a couple sprays to do its thing.
"
"
I bit too sticky but does the job!
"
"
Easy to use, smells amazing feels light.
"
"
Great product.  Helps to control the frizz halo.
"
"
Love it. Easy to apply, hair has a lot of curls, and helps to control the frizz.
"
"
I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.It's a super addition and it smells terrific too!
"
"
Great product for curly hair.  I even use it when I straighten my hair to prevent flyaways.
"
"
GREAT product. Delivered on time and not left where dog could open first.
"
"
great product - controls the frizz and holds the curls - great fresh scent !! Super fast professional shipping :)
"
"
Smell and curls
"
"
Living in Florida in the summer means finding a way to manage the humidity or wearing a hat all summer. This product was great at helping tame the Florida frizzes and helping my curls to look great. Thanks Deva Curl.
"
"
I love this product. I have used it for several years, and it helps keeping my curls in shape, but not making them feel sticky or hard. I recommend this to anyone who has curly and frizzy hair.
"
"
Love it !!!
"
"
I have naturally curly hair.  Although there are many Deva Curl products, this is the one that I use and like the most.  I wash my hair, spray it on my hair, and off I go!  I like the fact that it does not make my hair feel sticky! I do not like a lot of ""product"" in my hair.  I like the natural look.
"
"
RECEIVED AS PROMISED!
"
"
Love this!!
"
"
Great Buy! Great product! Speedy with shipping! Will buy from this seller again & again!!
"
"
too sticky feeling for my fine wavy hair
"
"
Nice anti-frizz formula that also adds shine.
"
"
I have very curly and dry hair and this product leaves my hair crunchyit's my first time using a devacurl product and i feel disappointed...
"
"
I use this after the gel to try and help with the frizz I just can't get rid of.  I also use it to help refresh curls.  It works great. No complaints.
"
"
Different from what I buy at Ulta. This product has been watered down.
"
"
This is the best product I've found to use in my mixed daughters hair... It is absolutely AMAZING
"
"
I use this product very regularly and it does what it is supposed to.  Also, I love the very light fragrance.
"
"
Works and smells great.
"
"
love it
"
"
Not really a fan.  Dries out my curls.
"
"
LOVE IT !
"
"
Great stuff
"
"
Continue to purchase over and over again.
"
"
I've only used this product a handful of times due to the fact that it made my hair extremely greasy. I typically can go a few days without washing my hair but when using this product I had to wash daily.
"
"
Can not live without this product!
"
"
I really like this.  It does what it says.  It takes my frizz away.  I spray it on before I leave the house in the morning and my curls look great all day.This is a great ""freshener.""  I don't use it after I get it out of the shower.  I use it a day or two after I wash my hair.I have 2B wavy/curly hair.  This product smells soooo good.
"
"
This product is great. I just wash, towel dry my hair spray with SET IT FREE and let it dry. If I need a touch up just spritz a little and your good to go. This stuff is great in the summer.
"
"
Great product, great price,  fast delivery!
"
"
Best curling product ever. I've been using it for over a year and will continue to do so. I used to use the Tres Semme mousse for years and am so happy I made the switch!
"
"
I have used the Deva conditioner and cleanser for years.  This leaves my hair feeling weighted down by the thickness.  The smell is very strong and artificial.  I would not recommend.  I will go back to mixing the Deva conditioner with water in my spray bottle, which works much better.
"
"
More watery than the product in a salon.
"
"
excellent
"
"
I love Deva Curl products!!! I especially like this one because it does not make my curls hard.

I like keeping this spray at work and in my gym bag to refresh my curls. It helps tame freeze without making them crunchy. It also smells good (like those soda pop candies?!) and doesn't feel gross on my hands (just in case i get stuck in a situation where i can't wash it off).Tip: It's easier to use if you spray it in your hands then scrunch it into your hair.
"
"
I love this stuff..its exactly what I needed
"
"
Applying right before hair drying helps the curl to draw up so much better than when not using this product.  I love it!
"
"
I bought this product for my daughter's hair.  She fights with the frizz and this product brought back her curls.
"
"
This combined with the Deva Curl gel holds my daughter's curl in place with minimum frizz even on a humid day. I have never found another product that works this well on her hair. Her hair is super thick, long and curly and she use to hate wearing it down, now she wears it down alll the time.
"
"
Perfect for refreshing my hair.  Love it.
"
"
The entire DevaCurl (Care) line is fantastic.  If you've got curly hair, these products will change the way you feel about it.
"
"
Works really well for the unruly curly hair
"
"
I have naturally wavy hair.  This product enhances wave/curl without making it crunchy. As an added bonus, it smells great!
"
"
It's not what I expected. .. was not happy with it..
"
"
One of my favorite Deva Curl products! Moisture plus soft curl definition.
"
"
I absolutely love this product!I no longer have to apply triple...sometimes quadruple layers of hair product to keep it frizz free and soft.  No more crunchy and crispy curls either.  I just wash my hair, spray and go!Careful with over-dosing, though.  Hair can get gunky if you go overboard with application.  Scent is wonderful, too!
"
"
I love the smell of this stuff.  I can't say it actually moisturizes my hair, but the smell is amazing.
"
"
Love every Deva product I use (this, shampoo and conditioner) for my curly hair.
"
"
I have very fine, curly hair and most products either weigh down my hair so much it has trouble keeping its curl or dry it out so much it gets frizzy. Before DevaCurl I had the most luck with Redken Fresh Curl shampoo, conditioner and curl boost spray as well as L'Oreal Leave-In Conditioner for curls, but even that combo would dry it out a bit too much.My stylist recommended the DevaCurl product line & I am so grateful. It is very moisturizing without being heavy & even the most frizz-prone bits of my hair have spiraled into perfect curls. I tried using some DevaCurl combined with the above-mentioned other brand products I already used & that was an improvement, but once I switched to exclusively DevaCurl stuff every aspect of my hair & curls improved. No, Deva Concepts does not pay me. :)Seriously, this stuff works wonders! My curls are very happy with me now.
"
"
I started using the Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel which has hold but still seemed to make my hair feel frizzy, so I used this along side that, and it works well. BUT if you are using any stronger type gel like the Arc Angel don't use this spray because it will make your hair sticky with a weird texture.  Another down side of this product is it's so small, it comes in such a small size & is just as expensive as other Deva Curl 12oz products, and if you have thick curly hair like mine you go through a lot. I recently had a Deva Cut and switched back to Arc Angel because it's stronger & my curl pattern has been corrected so don't have much frizz. So while it's a good product to use, it may just be more cost efficient to go with a stronger gel, but it will mainly depend on your hair type
"
"
I love Deva Curl products! Set It Free helps keep my curls in check during the hot and humid summer. It's awesome not frizzing out all the time now.
"
"
Use it daily! Love it!
"
"
Love it. Got here early too
"
"
Love this for slightly untamable frizzy hair. I personally need a heavy gel to create any kind of curl and I do not use this on my hair. But it's perfect for my girls who have not yet developed my full blown head of frizz thank goodness! It helps to calm hair and bring out the curl. As for applying any product to frizzy/curly hair, I recommend spritzing your hair with water before applying any product to your hair. The water helps to dispense the product more evenly throughout your hair, and Deva Curl is no exception. Then, work it through with your fingers or a brush/comb if your hair allows.
"
"
I have wavy hair and this product is great.  Creates curl and eliminates the frizz.  I'm a Deva Girl.  Love it!
"
"
My hair is very naturally curly.  I have tried this product twice since purchasing it.  It leaves a film on my hair and the feel after it dries is no pleasant.  I will not purchase this product or others similar from this company in the future.  Very disappointed.
"
"
Amazing product, both the gel and the spray, especially with the Midwest humidity!
"
"
so great for my curly hair. really keeps frizz out
"
"
Love this stuff
"
"
great product great price
"
"
I love Deva Curl! I have curly unruly hair and the Deva Curl system is the only thing that works for me. I won't ever use anything else.
"
"
Leaves my hair curly, not crunchy!
"
"
I can't go without this spray.  I use it faithfully after washing my hair.  Over time, I have noticed a huge difference in my hair's moisture.  It isn't so frizzy but will dry in nice curls.  It doesn't leave any heaviness or stickiness either.  The smell is great, too, kind of a lemon-lime fresh scent.  I absolutely love the Deva Curl line but I think this product is my favorite.
"
"
Revives my curls with very little effort. Love the smell as well. Awesome product to try- it will be a staple in my hair routine.
"
"
Love the deva curl set it free! I have fine naturally curly hair and this helps detangle and a light leave in conditioner. It doesn't tame the frizz so much but helps with slip when styling it. I apply it as soon as I get out of shower and combine it with other deva curl products. It arrived on time and it new condition. I will purchase again.
"
"
I've been using this product for about 4 years. I love it! Holds the curls in and adds moisture to my hair. Have recommended it to several women with curly hair.
"
"
Had not used before. Like it in dry and wet hair!
"
"
Makes hair stiff and crunchy.
"
"
Once again, I was sadly disappointed with Deva. This spray (like the Deva Curl Mister Right), left my hair feeling sticky. I didn't see where the ""moisture"" and ""oil"" came in. It left me just wanting to go through my hair routine all over again. The smell was okay, but what's that mean if the actual product doesn't do what it's supposed to?! Sorry Deva, but I will NOT be buying this again, feels like they use some sort of ""glue"" in this. I will stick with real natural oils like jojoba and argan.
"
"
Great product and fast shipment!
"
"
Love this product for the day after a wash! Revitalizes your curly hair for fresh bouncy curls.
"
"
After using for a few days, this product left a large amount of build up in my hair. Also, it leaves my hair feeling oily which transfers to my face and made me break out. I would suggest only using this product on the ends of your hair. I would not purchase again because the effects did not last long enough and it was too oily for me. I have 2C/3B curls.
"
"
love it
"
"
❤️
"
"
Ok to use SPARINGLY on wavy or straight hair.  Would not at all recommend for fine or oily hair, probably excellent for dry, kinky or coily hair but I'm just speculating. Deva curl is the usually way to go.
"
"
This is a great product for retouching frizzy curls (I have 3A/3B curls).  I use this product to de-frizz hair when dried with a towel and on 2nd day hair.  The only thing I do not like about the product is that a lot of it falls to the floor when sprayed and makes it slippery.  It's easily cleaned with a wet towel, but I've never had a spray do this before.  This even happens when I hold the bottle right on my hair.  To remedy this, I spray directly into my hands and then run my hands over my hair.  It definitely works, just a bit annoying.  Nevertheless, I'm hooked and will continue to buy this product.The attached photo is 2nd day hair, after being towel-dried, and about an hour after a rain/snow storm with NO touch ups.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
This is the best hair spray for curly hair that I've owned.  Is it possible to find a comparable drug store brand, though?  I think it might be.
"
"
Save your money and purchase this from a real salon! I've been using this product forever and always buy it from my salon but didn't feel like making the trip. The product I received is a fake. I can tell just by how it doesn't work on my hair like it should AND by the bottle. A sticker over the barcode is a sign of a counterfeit product. Save your money, spend a couple dollars more and buy the real thing that will actually WORK!
"
"
Works wonders!
"
"
great
"
"
I didn't know what to do with this spray. It is supposed to add moisture and frizz control, but instead it felt as if it left a sticky, oily layer on my hair so that when I went to move my hair, pieces of my hair were stuck together which caused more frizz. Maybe this product wasn't meant for my type of curls?
"
"
I started out loving this product but after a few weeks I was disappointed. I've been using deva products for years and some of their products are hit or miss. It started to flake leaving white residue. I hate when I think I've found a good product and it disappoints
"
"
I have 3b-3c curls and I love most of the deva line. I decided to add this to my beauty line up and I'm glad I did. I spray it in my hand and apply to dry hair to revive the curl on non-wash hair days. It's a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and you don't need much.
"
"
This stuff is awesome. Period.
"
"
This is a Great Product for naturally curly/wavy hair.Use it Lightly, if you use to much it doesn't work as well.Also, once you get to the bottom of the bottle the product doesn't spray well.This isn't a big deal, just order two bottles and pour the left over in the new bottle!That is how much I Love this product, I order at least two bottles at a time. (Free Shipping)!Enjoy.
"
"
I love this product a lot. It's a little heavy but I think at first I used too much product. I cut back and it's not as heavy. I mainly use this on my ends which are the driest of my hair. I use it along with the coconut curl styler. Very good on my hair. Highly recommend this product.
"
"
I have a lot of curly hair which tends to frizz and dry out. This product enhances my curls and moisturizes my hair.
"
"
It has really calmed and protected my hair.
"

I'm relatively new to Devacurl. I'm white with thin blonde hair that has a wave. My girlfriend (also Caucasian) has honest curly hair. She's always been very picky about who cuts it, etc. She called me to tell me about this line saying to try it for myself. She said she's NEVER had hair like this in her life (she's in her 60's and a famous gifted  massage therapist. So I bought the first 3 things she said to try. The ""No Poo Shampoo"", The ""No Poo Conditioner"", and the ""Firm Holding Gel"". To my surprise, I looked a whole lot better (make note, I watched several YouTube videos to see how to apply, etc. and suggest you do the same). Then I purchased the clips recommended, and this ""Set It Free"" which I saw on DevaCurl's website (video there). Yesterday I used it to fluff up my hair and add shine. Went to dinner with two couples I'd never met and immediately got the, ""Wish MY hair could do that, your curls are SO soft and nice! "" Honestly, my hair has taken on a whole new life of its own. I can't rave enough about this stuff. My husband even said on the way home he felt like he was ""showing me off"" all night. My husband hasn't said that in many years...there was only my hair to thank. I wore black pants, sandals , white tee & white scarf. My hair was the showpiece. Lol
"
"
I was really hoping to love this product. I ordered it and waited patiently (impatiently) for it to arrive because I was beyond excited.However it just didn't do the trick. It makes my hair look greasy and flat. It's almost like it weighs it down. For what I paid for it I am really upset about it. I really wanted to love this!It does smell pretty good though. That's about all the nice things I can say about it.
"
"
This product did absolutely nothing for me.  Tried to return it to seller crystalo*de*neve, however received a very rude reply from them, refusing my return request, ""We just sell the product,  we do not make it. Sorry it did not work for you, but we can't authorize this return.""  So, I guess I am stuck with an expensive bottle of spray that does nothing.
"
"
You really don't need too much of this spray.  I have shoulder length hair (when wet) and typically spritz about 8 times all over my hair and then scrunch it.  The product leaves your hair feeling really soft and your curls bouncy. It's also great the next day to touch up your curls. One of my favorite products.
"
"
Does not weigh hair down!
"
"
You really need to use this product for at least a few days to see if you like it.  At first I was just delighted that it didn't have chemicals, but after using it for a couple of days (I don't wash my hair every day) my scalp was still clean but my hair felt filthy to the touch.  It goes on wet, which takes getting used to.  I'm not used to having to wait for my hairspray to dry.  But the real deal breaker was just how dirty it felt.  Couldn't wait to get it out of my hair.  So the search continues... to find a decent hairspray that is not filled with toxic ingredients but still works.  This did not really provide any hold.  Hairspray typically holds a style, but this one didn't for me.
"
"
At the same time I ordered their shampoo I also ordered the Deva curl set it free which is like a hair spray but is not stiff. It keeps my curly hair in place without being stiff. My hair smells so great that I don't mind being next to someone and bending over to talk to them. Amazon shipped out this product just as fast as the shampoo. Very satisfied.
"
"
Like it but I expected  more from this product.  I think I expected a little more curl power for in between shampoos.  But its ok I will keep using it.
"
"
This is just the right thing to spritz n naturally curly hair to get rice of the frizzy ends.
"
"
My new favorite product...I have a thick head of wavy hair and live in Florida, which means I struggle with managing frizz.  I pull my hair up often and this product helps lock in my natural curl with a soft set.  I can take my hair down and repritz to freshen without the crunch.  I love it!
"
"
I'm really unhappy with this. I've tried it on wet hair and it doesn't do anything. Then I tried it on dry hair and it makes my hair feel stiff and almost sticky. Also I really don't like the strong smell.
"
"
unfortunately the deva curl isn't what i had hoped for.i've only used it 5 or 6 times and the bottle seems tobe almost empty. it's expensive and not worth the moneyfor what it does and how fast it disappears.
"
"
Love this product. Would buy again.
"
"
Love this product I put it in after I have washed and condition my hair it helps keep the frizz at bay
"
"
Nothing special....too much money for what it does which is as actually nothing for me
"
"
Did not work for me. Minimal hold. Back to old routine. If wanting to try Curly Girl, Kinky-Curly is a MUCH better product.
"
"
It does not seem to help keep the frizz down. (Edward is my husband and he ordered this for me...Carolyn Pettit)
"
"
Exactly what I wanted!
"
"
Highly recommend for curly hair. No disgusting chemicals either. Not sticky. Smells nice.
"
"
Smells great
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Really loved this product so I purchased two bottles.  The first bottle I used worked fine, however, the second bottle will not spray.  The product oozes down the sides of the bottle like a cream making it impossible to use.  The price is much too expensive for an unusable product.
"
"
like it!
"
"
I haven't used this product yet, but I'm sure that I won't be disappointed. I use a lot of Deva curl products. And, I love them!
"
"
This stuff smells amazing! I wish every product i use smelled like this! I wish I had a body spray that smelled like this! I wish life smelled like this! The scent is light, fresh and fruity. Not overpowering or overwhelming.I use this after washing/conditioning or cowashing and then diffusing and styling. It really does help to set my curls in place. I've experimented with and without it, and I can definitely see the difference. It never leaves my hair crunchy, flaky, stiff or stringy. Of course, you'll have to figure out how much works for you. I'm sure if I used more than I do I may have problems.I also use this to give my curls a little pick me up during the day if they start to droop. Living on the coast, I have to deal with alot of windy days. A few sprays of this, and I'm looking better than ever.For my second day curls, this works wonders. A few sprays and some scrunching... I'm good to go.For third days, I use my Q-redew (hair steamer) to bring moisture and life back into my hair. I spritz this product on first, steam my hair and spray a bit more when I'm done to lock it in place.I use this on dry hair only. I've never tried it on wet hair. The product is a thicker liquid and comes out of the bottle easily. It sprays evenly and never clogs up.My only complaint is that the bottle is so small. Rumor has it there once was a bigger bottle. Hey Devacurl, what happened to that? I'd love to see this in the Mist-er Right size.

I struggled with the thought of carrying my heavy Canon 5D on my cruise trip in Europe--even to the point of replacing it, because it has been such a burden to carry.  As a desperate, last ditch effort I ordered the Joby strap for Women.  I am amazed that I was able to carry that camera full time on many tours and many miles of walking in Rome, Naples, Marseilles, etc.  My camera was always ready for that quick shot.  I actually had a woman in Rome take a picture of the strap with the name so that she could order one when she got home.  In the past my shoulder and neck would hurt after carrying my camera, but not a twinge!!  Thanks Joby for designing a strap that distributes the weight just for women!!!!
"
"
I have A3 curly hair, It does a good job of reducing frizz, and keeping my hair shiny, even when its quite humid.But it feels sticky and gives me scalp build up, it might be something wrong with the way I use it? Not sure. Another thing is that I really dislike the smell, especially when it’s on my hair, it makes my hair smell rather oily.
"
"
Didn't do much for my hair.The spray bottle itself is low quality, causing the liquid to come out in streams rather than mist, so spraying it directly on the hair gives uneven coverage. Best way to use it is to spray into my hands and then apply, but it makes the hands sticky until it's washed off or dried. Also has really heavy, candy scent.Anyway, while I did notice some shine, there was zero frizz control, and I don't need to go through all this trouble for a bit of shine.
"
"
I have 3b curls that look more like 3c in high humidity, mostly corkscrews with some botticelli waves too.  My hair is fine, but there is lots of it.  Past my shoulders.I really love this product.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, unlike most other reviewers, I find the smell to be too strong.  Granted, I have lots of allergies so my nose is probably more sensitive.  But I deal with the scent as this works so well.I use this product 2 different ways:1. On dry hair, this will fix a bad hair day (frizz, stringiness, some curls fell straight, etc.).  Sometimes I spray in my hands then smooth over the offending sections of hair, give it a little scrunch, and it will dry in 30 minutes or so into shiny curls, like magic!2. On wet hair, after leaving most of my One Condition in, I will scrunch out some water, then spray my hair thoroughly with Set It Free (maybe 12 pumps).  This was my routine when I lived in humid Florida and I actually had shiny, bouncy curls that would last at least 2 days with some slight refreshing with the spray.  Only thing I don't like about this routine is that your hair stays wet for a long time (I don't diffuse) and it is expensive.So my routine with it now is to fix bad hair days on dry hair.  It's just more affordable and I live in a colder climate now and don't want my hair wet all day.  Angell and B'Curls didn't work for me but I Love SIF.
"
"
Worse Deva Curl product I’ve bought. Used it three times and every time it leaves my hair flatter and lifeless than before. I have Type 2B hair - wavy. I do not recommend this for wavies.
"
"
I'd give zero stars if I could. The product did the exact opposite of what it claims. Caused my curly hair to frizz up beyond what it does with no product. Later tried it on dry hair, and it made the frizz worse, also turning it into a knotty mess! Lousy.
"
"
Set it Free is the only product I've tried since going ""Curly Girl"" last year that really enhances my curls. My hair is fairly short and fine. I spray Set it Free sparingly on my wet hair after applying and scrunching in a little Angell, then scrunch it in thoroughly. That's it. My curls set up and hold. I haven't tried using it on its own without another product, but I will. If it works this well alone, I'll save money!
"
"
Let me start by saying, I LOVE DEVACURL.  I especially love Set it Free, because it has saved me from serious pouf head this extremely HUMID and HOT summer.  In combination with No-Poo and One Condition, my hair is very moisturized and my curls have lovely definition!  I am so glad I found Devacurl and Set it Free!  I started with the travel kit, which i recommend (B000QSDHPG I loved everything but anGEL, however tons of people have had great success with it.  If you have naturally curly hair, try Devacurl!!!!!  Mix and match products until you find the perfect combination for your hair type.
"
"
Don't use to much or your hair will get crunchy and feel dirty otherwise it's a decent light hairspray
"
"
Better value than the specialty store nearby.
"
"
I absolutely love this product! It smells GREAT, very unique scent. I mix this with the Styling Cream and my hair is left smooth, frizz free and my waves are perfected. You can use this in wet or dry hair but I find that it weighs my hair down (and I have THICK hair, so nothing usually weighs it down) and leaves me feeling greasy when I use this in wet hair. That's somewhat a given when you put a product like this in dry hair, though.
"
"
Love the No poo and conditioner, but this product as a leave in left my daughters hair feeling little thick and sticky, not light and smooth as expected.
"
"
Set It Free can be used on wet or dry hair to define curls and hold in moisture all day.  It reactivates gel and it helps curls bounce into shape without frizz.  This can be used throughout the day on my hair, because my hair is so dry.  Set It Free smells like Key Lime Pie, so my hair looks and smells fresh.
"
"
Just an amazing product to keep your hair hydrated and never going dry or damaged. Has a very sweet unisex smell to it. The whole family uses it, we love it.
"
"
This product was like spraying glue in my hair. It gave my curls a very dry/powdery appearance and made them so hard that I could barely separate them. There was not any moisture to the spray and I can't figure out a purpose where I would prefer to use this product at any time - especially with how dull it left my hair looking. It was not for me - curly 3/3b hair.
"
"
Great
"
"
Love it!!!
"
"
like
"
"
Love this stuff.  Tried the Curly Girl routine without it.  Was always a bit fuzzy.  Gotta have it for the look!
"
"
I like the way this product makes my hair feel.  Usually use it just before leaving the house for the day.
"
"
I use this the day after I wash my hair (use the Deva gel after I wash it).It usually perks up my curls and cuts the frizz.
"
"
i love this product.  i get some many more compliments on my hair when i use it.  i never travel without it.
"
"
for a person with natural curly hair this is amazing it smooths the hair and makes it extra curly this is the ONLY product in the devacurl products that doesnt riun my hair
"
"
WORKS GREAT ON MY CURLS... A PRODUCT THAT DOES WHAT IT SAYS .... WORTH THE MONEY!!!! A LIL GOES A LONG WAY...
"
"
I have tried many products for curly hair and I love this one. I will be buying the shampoo & conditioner soon so I can use it as a set. It also smells great too. Thanks
"
"
I have a lot of really fine curly hair. Its good quality and it seems that it would be great for medium or coarse curls. Its just too heavy for mine.
"
"
I really enjoy this product.  My stylist introduced me to it and it works well for keeping my hair frizz free and does not  leave a build up.  I use it combined with Angell by DevaCurl.
"
"
The one Deva product I can't live without. Some of the bad reviews seem to be from people who don't understand that this product is not meant to do the same thing as a gel or mousse. In other words, it's not a MAIN styling product. It's a ""freshener"", or to help control the halo of frizzies that you sometimes get. It's a great product to use the second, third, fourth day (lots curly girls don't/shouldn't wash their hair more than a couple times a week) to freshen up the curls and it works great! I have thick curly hair that has become more course with looser curls since I stopped coloring it a few years ago. Some products have stopped working as well for me, but not the Set It Free!
"
"
Great product! I use all deva curl products and this one didn't disappoint. I use it on day 3/4 hair and it keeps my curls nice and fresh and shiny. I also like the smell.
"
"
I have very wavy hair that is also very fine.  This allows me to tame it without a product containing alcohol. After I have my hair the way I want it,  I just squirt a couple of squirts in my hand, rub them together and pat my hair.
"
"
This would be the one product that is really needed. I have shoulder length thick hair. Thist makes 2nd, and the third days possible I also love the deva no poo and the one conditioner. I have been using these three products about 2+years now. My hair has never looked better than ever and I save about one hour each day with curling irons etc. I love set it free is a great product
"
"
Deva Curl Set it Free is a summer MUST for us curly girls. I use a quick spray out of the shower on damp hair, and later in the day for a refresh. The fragrance is sweet and fresh. It really does keep the frizz at bay, spray, scrunch, and then don't fuss with the curls. Good stuff!
"
"
This is great.  I spritz it on my dry hair to revive curls and it really perks things up.  Don't have to wash & style again.  Highly recommend.
"
"
The jury is still out on this item. It's a finishing spray for curly hair, but it doesn't seem to have much hold (kind of a good thing for curly hair, but then it's not really a hairspray) and I wouldn't say it's an especially shiny finish. It's ok, and it says it locks in moisture which seems a legitimate claim. I'll update later if I observe any other benefits or detriments.
"
"
Personally, i didn't feel this worked for me. I have thick wavy/curly hair and i use other devacurl products that work great, this didn't. It smells very nice, but doesn't hold frizz and i wouldn't use it on dry hair because it's a little sticky and can make your hair crunchy. I mostly use it on wet hair and don't see any difference, but maybe my hair is just difficult.
"
"
Makes a huge difference on my day 2 and 3 curls. First I spray my hair all over with water then I spray it all over with this product. Then I use a pea size amount of DevaCurls styling coconut cream. Do not comb through, just rub on the ends. After use a cotton t shirt to scrunch my hair gently.
"
"
I have been using this product for several years.  I have soft curly hair and this product helps the curl to last all day long.  I buy them for much less than at a beauty store and with buying them 3 at a time I get free shipping.  Wouldn't be without this product.
"
"
I have kinda coarse naturally curly hair, I'm over 65 and have the remnants of hair coloring in my hair.  I mention all of that because I'm not sure how much those factor into my NOT finding this particular DevaCurl product helpful to me.  I've been letting the color grow out for about a year now and am just about ready to make an appt. to have a haircut (by a curly hair stylist).  Maybe once that's done, I'll find this product to be more beneficial to my hair.  I do LOVE most of the other DC products that I've tried and use them on a regular basis
"
"
Probably my favorite DevCurl product. I made the change to almost exclusively DC products and adding this to my routine only makes me love this product line more. Adds an extra day between washes and my curls have never looked better.
"
"
I use this daily to refresh my curls.  I couldn't live without it.
"
"
A little goes a long way. Don't need a ton of squirt but it does help with frizzones on my little guys ""mixed"" fro. We use the diva curl shampoo and conditioner as well. Best stuff we have found yet to manage an unruly fro.
"
"
I used the entire deva curl line. No poo, one condition, mister right, light defining gel and this. This product is key for making sure that my curls are defined and frizz free. I spray some on before I apply the gel, then I dry and spritz a little more. It is perfect!
"
"
I'm impressed with this product. After visiting one of the Deva Curl salons here in NYC (highly recommend) I found out I wasn't conditioning my hair enough. This product is great for that...I didn't see a bunch of high shine but my hair was soft, had fluffy curls with low frizz. I actually received a compliment on how ""healthy"" my hair looked. I will definitely buy again.

Set it Free smells great and makes my hair soft and shiny. I use it in place of styling gel.  It doesn't exactly spray in an even mist since it's more like the texture of a leave-in conditioner, but you can spray and scrunch or spray it in the palm of you hand, rub your hands together, and then run it through your hair.  Holds well enough not to have to use traditional hairspray and fights frizz and static very well!
"
"
This works really well when you get up in the am and need to refresh your curls.  Love the product
"
"
Love this product!  It is great for smoothing the frizz but not removing the curl from my hair.  It has a very nice fragrance.  It arrived promptly and was well packaged.
"
"
A friend in Maui told me to try this product, love it leaves your hair shiny and really holds your curl no grizzlies!!!
"
"
Great product. This stuff works. Shipment arrived when promised.
"
"
Believe the hype! Refreshed me perfectly, it looks like I just washed.I use a pick all over to untangle my curls, then spray this and it looks fresh & new. A godsend !
"
"
I use this as my everyday frizz tamer because it does an adequate job. It's a great value for what it does and the fact that it's gentle on your hair. It has a stronger scent than I'd like, one that I don't necessarily care for, and it overpowers my perfume. I'm on the fence as to whether I'll continue using it or look for something I like better.On important days, I use a combination of WEN styling creme and oil, and generally my hair is so smooth, shiny, and silky on days 2 and 3 that I don't need to rewash my hair if I don't want to. If WEN products were cheaper, I'd use this combination every day. I see a lot of similarities between the WEN and Deva Curl lines, although it seems as though Deva Curl spends less on marketing and more on making good products that are gentle on your hair, competitively priced, and can compete with high-end salon brands.
"
"
Devacurl makes some awesome products, but I'm not impressed with this at all. It doesn't do much other than make my hair look crunchy if I use too much, and if I use less than it doesn't really do anything noticeable. I much prefer the creams and gel.
"
"
I like it except it leaves a residue which is really hard to wash out
"
"
I have enough products for my curly hair to open a small boutique.  So far, I love this one .  When my curls need a little perking up, I spray some Set It Free , and they look great again.  Often helps me avoid having to put my hair up the second day
"
"
I have ordered this product several times.  It does not leave your hair cakey in any way shape or form.  I find that it holds for the whole day.  A lot of times I will just go to bed with wet hair and then in the morning spray a little water on it and use the Deva Curl and it looks great!Only minor complaint is that sometimes the spray comes out in more of a line than a larger mist area.
"
"
Dont use it very much as im still learning what it works best with. The smell however is wonderful and it is great at flattening flyaways.
"
"
On the fence with the product.  I could live with or without it.  I can refresh my curls with water for free... But this product wasn't bad.  Not sure if it's worth the expense since I didn't see a noticable difference in my curls moisture daily.
"
"
If you have curly hair, this whole line is a must! I have had curly hair and by curly, I mean frizzy and large, this whole line has taken that all away! I now love my hair and it is now in real ringlets! My tip though is going to the deva website so that you can use the products properly
"
"
Oh my goodness the curls!! I just do not love the waxy feeling it leaves in my hair
"
"
I just used this product for the first time on my day 3 hair and I'm pretty impressed. I was worried about the negative reviews this product had but i feel those people are either trying to use to much of it at once or are generally misusing this product. I have thick, long, S'wavy hair which i only like to wash once a week because I have dyed red hair. I get major frizz problems and shapelessness because my hair gets so dry after about 4 days of wearing it down. I just tried this and I noticed the moisture lock pretty fast! my frizz has reduced significantly and some shape bounced back and though the smell of this product out of the bottle is a bit to strong, once you put it in your hair (if you use it appropriately) the smell isn't nearly as bad.. i actually like it! I used about 6 spritz of it on my hand and gently worked it through my dry areas. The product IS a little sticky and I noticed people complaining about that but if your hair is dry and actually needs this product, you wont feel it on your hair. It will feel hydrated, bouncy and happy!
"
"
One of their newest products, I decided try a couple of months ago, I already have an emergency bottle on hand!  By far the best curl re activator I have tried, in my life!  Smells delicious too.
"
"
Doesn’t do anything for my hair (thick, wavy, curly).
"
"
I don't like the way it sprays out of its container so I cut it in half with water and put it in my mister spray bottle.  It has a nice smell and works really well.  I like it better than their gel.  Okay, I'll stop rhyming now.  This is perfect for my fine, thick, naturally wavy, blonde hair.  I use it every day.
"
"
This is a great product. Gives a nice weavy curls and smells great too!
"
"
Love love love love deva curl. Love this product even more for my hair and my 13 month old sons!
"
"
my favorite deva curl product. My hair is curly but not very course or thick so the curls will get limp easily. This product will rejuvenate them and bring them back to life. I do however wish it smelled alittle better. It also can tend to be sticky.
"
"
Talk about helping with the fizz!!!  This stuff works.  I spray it in while my hair is wet and it really helps with the texture.  My hair is course and curly, this product feels like very watered down conditioner.  It lighty sprays on and helps define your curls.  Its great!
"
"
As with the Mist-Er Right, this product makes my hair gummy and sticky.  I'm hoping with the continued use of the No-Poo and the One Condition, my hair will improve and I'll be able to use this product (sparingly).  All the products smell wonderful.  I can see this one with the Mist-Er Right being excellent for people with thicker, longer hair. :)
"
"
Works great on my curls!
"
"
This was for my wife. She's been using it for years. Couldn't live without it.
"
"
This gives great moisture to hair that is dry without using heavy creams.  Heavy creams causes you to rub in the product and mostIkely cause frizz.  What is the point of having nice curls and taking the time for braid/twist-outs if you are going to mess up your curls
"
"
I've got very wavy hair that your average curl product regularly just weighs down and makes look real trailer-trashy (sorry for the comparison lol).  I did a review search on Amazon and came across the Deva line; the price turned me off since I'm cheap, but with all the great reviews and a gift card in hand, I bought it and was very excited for its arrival.  The very first thing I noticed was the scent...smelled exactly like Skittles!  Unfortunately, the frangrance wore off pretty quickly, and was one of the few things I liked about it.  I will say, it did exactly what I needed it to - I had great shaped curls, not just waves, that were light, defined and most importantly, didn't look or feel crispy.  I did have however a funky, grimey film on my hair that made it impossible to have second day hair.  Its definitely a keeper since it did what I wanted, but not very often simply for the texture it left in my hair.  Maybe next gift card season, I'll just try another product in the line.
"
"
love all the Deva Curl products I have tried. The Set it Free lotion is a nice finishing step after using the no-poo shampoo, one conditioner, and ultra hold gel. It softens the hair and allows you to smooth the last frizzes away, and it smells great.
"
"
I love using this mist as a daily moisturizer if I don't have my water bottles at my disposal. It smells really nice and it doesn't leave your hair feeling oily or weighed down.
"
"
I know people always rave about DevaCurl, and I'm here to tell you there's good reason. Honestly, it's worth the money. My curls are healthy, happy, and hydrated.
"
"
I love this stuff.  Of all the Deva products I've used, Set It Free and the cream are superior for a soft hold without a gunky feel.  I'm not too fond of any product's smell, including this one, but Set It Free doesn't smell that strongly.
"
"
I have fine hair and this really helps to make it feel fuller. Love this
"
"
great product
"
"
Love ❤️ love this product. Works amazing. Thank you 😊
"
"
I have natural curls (my daughter too) love it! simple as that! Spray on wet hair, crunch, air dry. perfect!
"
"
LOVE THE SMELL!! Leaves my hair soft, and bouncy. I can put it when it is wet or dry and still get the same results. After a full day of school, i come home and my hair isn't tangled at all... which is a big deal since i'm mostly outdoors!
"
"
This is a great ""wake me up"" for my curly hair in the mornings.  I use it everyday and get a great look quickly.  I spray it all over, bend over and scrunch my hair for a perfect look.
"
"
Love this product and it works really well on my hair. It has a nice fragrance to it and I will definitely be buying this product again
"
"
This is product is like frosting on the cake.  You can eat cake w/out frosting, but it sure tastes better with.  I use a variety of Deva products to ""hold my curl"" until it is dry.  Spraying this product on curly hair (especially in the winter) adds moisture and shine. Great way to top off your curl.
"
"
Love the smell and works great if my hair is wet. If I put it on dry hair it seems to make it kind of sticky.
"
"
I always get compliments from my friends and strangers on my hair and ask me what I use for my hair. I naturally have curly hair. But this beauty makes my hair Look more intense in a positive way. I use it first before the conditioner one.
"
"
I have thick, naturally curly shoulder-length hair and I'm a 36 y.o. female. Works nicely to relieve frizz and to ""freshen up"" 2nd or 3rd day of post-washed hair, but the day after using the spray the hair doesn't smell very good. The product leaves a weird, cardboardy odor. You'll know what I mean if ya try it. But definitely good for a quick ""newly washed"" look as long as applied on all sides of head. Curly-haired gals have it hard, so know this is a decent product. :)
"
"
Curl products never seem to work. I used this product for about 2 months and it didn't seem to do what it is supposed to do. Very unsatisfied.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair that is on the thin side so I have to use something that won't weigh my hair down.  This is a great product - it enhances my curls perfectly.  I normally just put this in my hair when it is wet and let it air dry - even being in humid Florida this works great.
"
"
the deva curly line is the best for us curly heads. I love the set it free because you can do a touch up at any time makes your hair soft and refreshes your curls a must have
"
"
This gives hair a fresh nice clean smell and helps it to curl more. Works well after shampooing while damp, or after waking without shampooing to active curl.
"
"
I love the smell of this product and it does keep my  curls in place.  It IS a bit sticky though, so I usually only use it the day before I'm going to wash my hair anyway.
"
"
Love to Deva products. This spray is great on 2nd & 3rd day curls.
"
"
great product
"
"
I only use Deva Curl products for my super curly hair. You can use on wet or dry, but it works best on dry hair.
"
"
My fiance has very course, curly hair and he loves this stuff. Defines curls and makes hair softer.
"
"
I just reviewd the kit: DevaCurl Kit For All Curlkind and mentioned this product. I used the shampoo and conditioner from this kit and then used the two other items it came with mixed together, diffused it a tiny bit after letting it air dry for an hour or so and then spritzed this on my entire head and  re-scrunched it to help the curls and it was awesome!I perm and highlight my hair. Permed twice in one week because first didn't take and before that it was 10 years since I got a perm. I have fine limp hair and desperately wanted some body.The next day (yesterday) I re-hydrated it with my water bottle and this and then rubbed the two from the kit together in my hand and re scrunched my curls and it worked!  So glad!  I am sold on DevaCurl!!
"
"
This spray was recommended to me by my hair stylist - I am in love with the smell and it really helps bring life back to weakened curls and reduce frizz!
"
"
I accidentally ordered the wrong product but love it anyway! Fast shipper!!
"
"
can't live without this product...The difference between happy moisturized curls or dry frizzy curls..
"
"
This product is so wonderful and refreshing to my curls!!! It adds zeal, life, and luster to my curls!!! It's a nice way to refreshing the texture of my curls during a humid day!!¡
"
"
It does the job - but you need to spray a lot and I don't like the smell
"
"
The shampoo (Low Poo) and conditioner (Ultra Creamy) are wonderful. If I'm going out at night after having my hair done from the morning, I revive my curl with Set it Free and just walk out. Looks like I just did my hair again.  Totally worth trying. Use it on dry hair.
"
"
Have used nothing but Deva for 8 years! Never going back.
"
"
I have just below the waist length 3b/3c combo hair and my hair just loves loves LOVES Deva Curls Set I Free I had to figure out how much product my hair needs, which fluctuates depending on a whole SLEW of things. But once I figured out I need a spritz today, a spray next week and a few pumps tomorrow, my hair has FLOURISHED. It doesn't weight my hair down as much as some other products, it hasn't given me that thick film feeling either.
"
"
I have been using Ouidad products and decided to give this a try since reviews were pretty good, but I'm not sure yet if I like it all that much. It has a nice smell, reminds me of an orange dreamsicle and it has an almost milky feel to it when spraying it on. It left my hair with bouncy, springy curls and I do have coarse, thick, frizzy hair but my curls were kind of bushy. I think I wasnt able to spray this on as well as I could because the nozzle on the bottle wasnt spraying too well so applying it wasnt on target with areas where I needed it most. My only other issue was with a 6 oz. bottle like this it goes fast and it isnt cheap.
"
"
While this spray gives a slight hold, it's definitely not an effective substitute for gel/mousse. It would probably work well to control fly-aways, but it doesn't work to control all of my hair on its own. (I have very thick, curly hair.)I do like that it's light and can be used on dry hair, which is good for when my hair needs a bit of boost later in the day or the day after washing it.Also, this smells really good. It smells exactly like Skittles.I wanted a better product for the price, but maybe I had the wrong expectation for it.
"
"
I have type 3a curly hair and i used this on day 2.  Day one I used the deva curl cream with so so results and tried using this on day two to refresh my curls.  this did help me define my curls, but it left them feeling sticky and i just did not like the look of my hair.  i gave this another try a week later.  This time i used the deva gel on day one and then tried to refresh with this on day two.  it did keep the curl that the gel set up but the sticky feeling was still there.  will not be using this for my hair.
"
"
Made my hair greasy - did not refresh it all
"
"
This product held my crazy hair without making it crunchy. If it held throughout the day, I would give it the fifth star, but my thick hair won in the end. Will still purchase again.
"
"
I've got fine, frizzy, color-treated hair.  It is just The Worst. I usually blow it dry then straighten it with a flat iron because all the other curly hair products that I've tried either leave it limp or looking like a crunchy 80s perm. Set It Free gives me bouncy, shiny, beachy waves.  No crunchiness at all. The way I use it is: I blow dry my hair while combing through with my fingers, then spray this on (maybe 10 sprays over my whole head), then I give my hair a few squeezes.  Instant, soft waves that last all day.
"
"
Even with my colored, gray and somewhat damaged hair, this product brings out the curl like no other!
"
"
I love this to freshen up my hair at the end of the day and it smells so good.  I carry a small bottle with me too.
"
"
This hydrates and actually produces waves. Great product, leaves hair soft not crunchy.
"
"
My go-to hair product. You can use a ton before it gets crunchy. Works great on my super-curly hair.
"
"
Works well. Decent price.
"
"
I recommend all the products in this line for curly hair.  They work great and really get a lot for your money.  I highly recommend.
"
"
If you have curly hair, you should try this product. It helps keep your curls in place all day. Use this with their other products.
"
"
Always great, love, love love this product for my type 3 a curl.
"
"
I am a Deva girl and use a lot of their products on my type 3b (fine, very curly) hair. Set it Free is an essential product for me and works well in two ways: 1) as a leave-in conditioner that I apply before the Light Defining Gel, and 2) on second or third day hair as a moisturizing refresher in combination with the lavender-scented product whose name escapes me at the moment.  I have to apply with a light hand otherwise this product can be heavy on my very fine hair, but light and even application is easy thanks to the spray nozzle. This is must-have, non-negotiable product in my haircare line-up.
"
"
This product worked great for my hair when it was short.
"
"
Love it. Curly girls need this to keep the frizzy hair away!
"
"
great product  would not be without  packaged in great travel container my good to go  solution for bad hair days plus part of my daily regimen
"
"
Arrived on time. I love the Deva curl and deva care line. Smells great and holds my curls in place.  It leaves the hair a little crunchy on day one, but it holds the curl for a full week with workouts and normal day to day use.
"
"
Great product and receipt my purchase quickly.  Will use this vendor again.  This was a great find!
"
"
Love it!!!!!
"
"
Great for later in the day when your curls need a refresh and even better for second day hair!
"
"
I love this spray and this line! The gel and this spray are my favorite two styling products from this line. I would highly recommend!
"
"
I LOVE Deva Curl!  It has transformed my hair from every day is a bad hair day to people coming up to me and complimenting my hair several times a day!  And this is my favorite product. It sets the curls so they don't frizz for the entire day and doesn't create too much of a ""product"" feel.  Can't say enough good things about it!
"
"
Moisturizing and light
"
"
love it for my 3 year old
"
"
I love this product! It truly boosts and hydrates your curls. I also love getting it at a great price. Much better than water for adding life to curls.
"
"
I find the DevaCurl Gel products are much better at taming my hair, but this is still great.  I think this product may work best for hair that has a bit looser curl than mine.
"
"
This is a great product for bringing out the curl in my hair without making it sticky or drying it out. Also, a little goes a long way so while a 6oz. bottle might seem small it will last you quite a while! I've used a lot of other products that I won't name here - everything from brands you'd find in the grocery store to *very* high-end product that made my eyes bug out when I heard the cost - but the DevaCurl line is the best value for money that I've found. Yes, it's more than the grocery store brands, but it's worth it, especially when you consider all the compliments you'll be getting on your nice, bouncy curls!
"
"
I swear by this stuff! I have crazy curl hair and it tames frizz like no other! Deva products changed my life.
"
"
Finally something to help with the frizz!! This stuff is amazing! I noticed a huge difference after using it for the first time- would FOR SURE recommend this for curly hair that tends to frizz over the course of the day.
"
"
This whole line is wonderful.
"
"
I love this stuff. I use it when I wake up the next morning to refresh my curls. They last all day. Will keep buying
"
"
Great product for curly hair
"
"
I really like it, some said it was sticky but I put a little water in it and its perfect.
"
"
There are better leave-ins for moisture-locking in (esp. a plethora of oils).  However, this buddy smells like Skittles, so 3-stars only for the smell.
"
"
gives your hair body without frizz. I have super stringy , frizzy , straight hair.. this helps give it body in the summer
"
"
loved it
"
"
Awesome product
"
"
Creates frizz free happy curls. Don't know what I did before this stuff! It's light but does leave a little residue so just be cognizent of how much you use.
"
"
Magic potion for curls! I LOOOOOOOOVE this stuff
"
"
Got it right away and the product is wonderful
"
"
Great product and came right away
"
"
I love this product for my curly frizzy hair, especially that it doesn't make my hair crunchy. Just wish it came in a bigger size.
"
"
I like Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee better
"
"
Works great on my daughter's thin curly hair
"
"
Best!
"
"
Love
"
"
This combined with the No Poo and conditioner make my hair look and smell fantastic.  Big, soft curls all the time now.  And so many compliments I wonder how bad my hair looked before.  No, I know how bad it looked before.  Horrible.
"
"
I'm a lover of deva poo shampoo and conditioner but this could define curl better.  But all in all I a fan of their products.  Brings out the curl of a person with curly hair. Got tired of curling out curls.  The shampoo keeps natural curls in
"
"
It is just ""okay"" in terms of results.  It goes on rather sticky, and the second you use too much, your hair will feel strange - dirty - all day.
"
"
My curls are so much more defined and less frizzy since I started using the Deva curl line of gels and spray.  It's great. I'd highly recommend it.  The scent is also great but not over powering.
"
"
I really wanted to get behind the Deva products. Ive had my hair cut at their salon and it was amazing. I got the Shampoo, Con, gel, moisture spray, the lot. I found the whole line really heavy and makes my 3B curls look really greasy. I only use the conditioner as a leave in now and again the rest of the stuff is wasting space in my cabinet. The moisture lock just make my hair smell like a lemon. Even though these products are marketed towards all curl types from wavy to kinky I have never seen a lady with 3 or 4 type curls that have been happy with them. So if you can get a Deva cut go for it but skip on the products.
"
"
A go-to product for my curly hair. It works best for me to revive my curls with ""bed head"" but I also use it directly after shampooing my hair. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny- no stiffness or stickiness.
"
"
This product is not for thin curly hair like mine.  It is very heavy. It smells nice, though and is not sticky. I have to dilute it with water to make it work.
"
"
I love using this product - gives a little extra moisture as needed and helps lessen frizz.
"
"
Leaves your curly hair without friz.  All DevaCurl products are great.  I use this along with DevaCurl SuperCram Coconut Curl Styler and Lite Gel
"
"
Great product! I've tried many products to keep my daughters curly hair frizz free and so far this has been the product that has worked the best. Thank you Deva Curl!
"
"
I like this line of hair care. The Set it free works on those days I didn't moisturize the night before.
"
"
Excellent product.  Met all my expectations
"
"
deva curl my niece love it
"
"
Smells great.
"
"
I have very curly hair and I have been using this product for 4 years and it is on my ""can't live without list""!
"
"
Great!
"
"
Cons:1. Expensive. Expensive.2. Inconvenience - Cant buy in bulk so have to shell out $15 for every 6 oz.Pros:1. I have botticelli curls. It is hard to make them look shiny without adding crappy/heavy products. This product makes my curls look shiny and hydrated.2. So NO frizz for upto 2 days.3. Adds shine without the oily feeling.4. Works like magic with ANGEL arc gel from Deva and its conditioner.10/22/12- This is still my most favorite that make my curls well defined and shiny. Everytime I wear a little more of this product my colleagues ask me if I got my hair set at a salon. Btw i use it sparingly because it is so expensive. So I mix up the conditioner+ angel + Set it free (in equal parts) and no crunchy curls.
"
"
Hated this stuff. I used it with the other Deva stuff but thus stuff left my hair feeling dirty and did nothing to help the curls. I pitched it! I love the shampoo and conditioner, but did not like the gel either. :-(
"
"
I use Deva Curl AnGel as a daily hair gel (I have thick, fairly tight curls), but when I want a little extra definition and shine I reach for the Set It Free. This stuff smells WONDERFUL and goes on really light despite its creamy texture, and it leaves my curls feeling silky-soft and looking really shiny and defined.I find that the main difference between Set It Free and Angel is that the Angel just holds my my hair in whatever shape its in to begin with, whereas applying Set It Free will actually turn frizzed-out curls into soft, smooth ringlets.Set It Free is also a great deal on Amazon (anywhere from $2-$6 cheaper than in my local salons), and a little bit goes a long way (though I wish it came in bottles bigger than 6 oz.). A great buy.
"
"
the best!
"
"
Maybe I am not using it right.. not sure.. but I sprayed on her damp hair.. and it leaves her hair very sticky and stiff and weird feeling..
"
"
I liked the shampoo and conditioner so thought I’d expand my product line at Ulta. I spritzed my hair and its super crunchy and sticky. I wouldn’t recommend this product.
"
"
I wish I could give this 5 stars, because the product performance is great for refreshing 2nd and 3rd day curls! The problem is the smell. It’s supposed to be a lemon/lime smell, but it smells like one of those cloying little tree car air fresheners. Don’t like my hair wafting that scent around all day. Sometimes they update the fragrance but keep the formula, as they did with the no-poo and conditioner in the past year or so (HUGE improvement!), so I’m hoping that they’ll do that here, too.
"
"
This is the only hair care line that has helped me take control of my four year old daughter's curly hair! Set it free literally revives the curls in between washes! I love it!
"
"
This is the BEST product I have ever purchased for my hair. I have baby fine naturally curly hair, so most setting lotions and gels actually drag my curls down. With this product I just spritz it on VERY lightly over my air dried hair, then I literally lift the curl and waves with my fingertips, let it dry thoroughly again and it comes out looking wavy, soft and shiny and not at all frizzy.  I need only use a little hairspray on my bangs and around the crown of my head and that's it.  No more plastering my hair with hairspray.  What's truly amazing is that even after a night of sleeping on it, the next morning my hair still looks full, wavy and pretty!  It only requires a little touching up with a wide toothed comb and I'm good for the whole day!  I'm in love!
"
"
I used this to detangle my curls. It worked great! It's not​ a hair spray as some seem to think. It's great on second day hair. I would mix this with a little water to refresh my curls in the morning, effectively restyling my bed Head.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair but a lot of factors go into keeping it curly and not frizzy.  There's the weather, the products I use, and how often I shampoo.  When it comes to products, Deva Curl Set it Free works wonderfully.  I put on my hair products (oil and curl gel) and then spray my hair with the Set It Free. It stays looking fresh, clean and curly for three days.  I just love the smell of it as well - sort of a lemon-lime fragrance.  I highly recommend this product.Deva also produces a diffuser shaped somewhat like a hand that fits onto most hair dryers.  It is great for drying curly hair.
"
"
Set It Free is a really great product by DevaCurl. You can spray it on your hair, wet or dry. When dry it can be used even as a texturizer, which is really fun. When wet it help your hair stay shiny and silky and gives it some extra bounce. It won't make your hair curly, but if you already have curly hair it's a great product that will help you maintain your hair in a healthy gorgeous way. So you can get different results by using it different ways. I highly recommend the product. On top of it, it has an amazing smell. I just LOVE the way it smells. Nothing like it.
"
"
I don't know what all the hype about this product is about.  It did absolutely zero for my hair.  I have natural waves and this lotion didn't control the frizz as it promised and had no clear benefit whatsoever that I could detect.  I used this with the No Poo (which isn't any better than VO5 Kiwi Lime Conditioner, a secret I learned from an online beauty review site) and the Arc Angell gel.  You would think that such expensive products would be better than the much more reasonably priced line I use (Got2be, which I like better) but they're not.  I think these products are overpriced and the reviews suspect.  Maybe those with curlier, wavier hair benefit more, but this line was recommended by my stylist and I purchased all three products because he assured me they work better when used in conjunction with one another.  Hogwash!  Don't waste your money!  For frizz, Got2be shine serum works like a charm and their Kinkier mousse is strong and the hold lasts all day and isn't crunchy at all.  Buy yourself some wonderful perfume or some such luxury.  Your money would be much better spent somewhere else.  I don't recommend this product or this line at all.

I hate traditional hair sprays because they make me feel like I'm wearing a helmet on my head.  Deva's Curl Set It Free helps to maintain your curls without that helmet-like feel.  This product takes away the fly-away nature of frizz and retains the natural curl you get right after shampoo and dry.  It is an indispensable product to me and I use it after every shampoo along with Deva or Bumble and Bumble products.

I have type 3A curls. This did not work for me. It made my hair feel very dry and look frizzy.

While I absolutely love this product, I do have some down-points about it. I use immediately after applying my AnGEL to wet hair after my shower, I let my hair air dry as recommended and then after it's mostly dry I spritz some more on. While it does add shine and definition to my curls, I feel like it also weighs them down makes them heavier, and adds a slightly oily look to my hair sometimes. I would still absolutely recommend this product, but use sparingly.

I have fine wavy/curly hair depending on the day. This product is the best invention I spray it on dry and it turns my hair into the beachy look. It's amazing it also makes ringlet's in my hair. Lorraine Massey is the curly hair genius she def knows her stuff

I've tried most of the products in the Deva line, and while I use and like the LowPoo and One Condition in the DEVACare line, and I like to refresh with Mist-er Right, and I use B-leave In to refresh with conditioner on 2nd and 3d days, and I like Arc Angell, THIS STUFF DID NOTHING as promised. Frizz was not reduced. Moisture was not locked in.Now, granted, I have dry 3b hair with high porosity. Maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair. But for me, nada. Zip.It does smell nice, though. That earns it at least one star. I have one bottle that I'll finish up--I use it when I use Mist-er right to add a layer of nice scent, citrus over lavender. Careful not to spritz too much, or your hair gets a dull, sort of waxy feel.But, really,can't recommend it.Ingredients:IngredientsAqueous Extracts of: Achilea Millefolium, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Cymbopogon Schoenanthus, Humulus Lupulus (Hops), Melissa Offcinalis (Balm Mint), Rosmarinus Offcinalis (Rosemary), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkylmethacrylate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, PVP, Beeswax, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Lipids, Sodium Hydroxide, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance.

So in love with this product line and set it free is the best!!! It's the only product that allows me to not wash my hair every day. I usually wake up with my curls all crazy but I use this to deactivate them and they look perfectly spiraled!!! I love it!!! I love DeVaCurl!!!

Great product!
"

got it quick.  love it to make my hair curly.  works great. I  have used this for a  couple yrs now and can use it  the 2nd  day on  my  dry hair to make it curl up and be soft again.

Deva Curl works wonders for my fine limp hair, giving it lots of volume and body.  I love it!

Update, this has now happened twice now.  Accidentally reordered from the same seller and the same thing happened.  This time it looks like it might be the right product inside the bottle, but it was delivered a mess, and there's no way it's new, it's not even full.Sorry, but it was so obviously refilled and kind of sloppily done.  The outside was super sticky and covered in gel and the top pump wasn’t taped down like it usually is with a new bottle. Also, it wasn’t even filled all the way.  I’ve been ordering this stuff for years and I know the smell and color of the Arc Angel product. This might have been the ultra defining gel because it was clear but Arc Angel is a soft orange and I KNOW they haven’t changed that because I was just in for a deva cut a few weeks ago.
"

Like others have posted, this gel is awesome, when you receive the correct product. I received what looked and smelled like the Ultra Defining gel in an Arc Angel gel bottle. Ultra Defining gel is clear-ish, while the Arc Angel gel is orange and smells citrusy. Both items (my original order and the replacement) were sold by Amazon.com LLC, so even the biggest sellers can be affected.Before trying this product, I was afraid to use gel on my curly hair because of high school experiences with crunchy, wet-looking hair and white flakes. This gel is different. Your hair will get ""crunchy"" but that's just the gel cast to help set your curls. Once your hair is dry, scrunch your curls a bit to get rid of the cast and you have great looking curls for days. The product smells great too. I keep mine in the shower, so I can apply to my curls and scrunch out the excess liquid before getting out of the shower.
"
"
Not sure what is going on here, but this is not DevaCurl.  The consistency is too thin compared to the product I had purchased directly from the store (which is not close to my house, hence trying Amazon).  It  does not hold my curl at all, which is also vastly different from the product bought directly from a Deva Curl store.  I believe this seller is pushing out fraudulent products.  If you have an opportunity to purchase a real Deva Curl product, it will work wonders for your hair.  Not so much this crap.

I’m of mixed race with super fine and frizzy tiny curls. I’m 50 years old and have been a product junky for most of my life, with mixed success. But I always wanted my hair to swing, and to hold it’s all-over curl, like it does when wet or freshly washed. I discovered DevaCurl 1 year ago by asking a black customer of mine what she used in her lovely curls. My hair is now perfect every day, even when I wake. When I get a haircut, I no longer need drastic damage cuts, and so my hair is the longest it’s been. The secret is to follow Deva Curls instruction book. 1. No other non-Deva products (this is non-silicone, non oil, so hydration can soak in). 2. Filter on shower head ($25 or so at home improvement stores, easy to self-install). 3. Use a satin pillowcase or head covering at night to stop friction (graceeleyae.com products recommended). 4. I only use 3 DevaCurl products. No-poo, Decadence Conditioner and Arc Gel. According to my hairdresser, I don’t need any of the deep conditioner. After washing and combing, re-wet hair, carefully squeeze out excess water, and soak strands thoroughly with conditioner, DevaCurl says until strands feel like seaweed. Use a microfiber towel or tee shirt to carefully squeeze out excess water. Put copious amounts of gel in. Hair will still be soft, nongreasy, and even comb-able (when wet), in future. 5. Wash hair as little as is necessary. I wash weekly. 6. For daily maintenance, I stand outside of shower, and moisten my hair in the running warm water. Re-squeeze with microfiber towel, finger comb if necessary and reapply more conditioner and gel. First time in my life that strangers stop me in the street daily to complement my hair! Products not cheap, but I’m no longer throwing away unworkable products or paying for Brazilian Blowouts, or relaxers, etc. I wasn’t paid in anyway for this recommendation.

I have heard a lot of good reviews for DevaCurl. So, after watching a video of girl with beautiful curly hair; I decided to give this one product a try. I needed a product to hold the shape of my curl and keep it. Also keep it from fizzing. My hair is definitely prone to frizz. I have fine hair and plenty of it and it is a little on the dry side. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I washed my hair in the evening and let it air dry for an hour; then dried it with a hair dryer to finish it. I slept on it all night and woke up with my curls still in tact. No Frizz!!! I showered the next morning, which will cause my hair to get damp and wet in some places. Still No Frizz!!! I am planning on purchasing a few of the other products I feel I need for my type of hair. I am very surprised it worked so well. I have tried so many other products in the past. I have chosen from expensive lines to inexpensive lines and haven't found one that works this well. This is a good size bottle so for the price it's not very expensive.
"

You have to use a lot of product and wait forever for it to dry in your hair. But when it does dry and you shake your hair to fluff it looks amazing!!! It last all day. And I found that if you spritz with water the next day your curls pop right back. Another huge downside is that if you have dry, thin or weak hair this product will make your hair fall out more. I used this product only a few times and each time I washed it out, a lot of hair came out too. So I won't use it anymore. I use Bella Curls now. Same effect and no hair falling out.
"
"
I LOVE LOVE Love this gel!  The key to getting a great result v/s a good result is application.  You need to apply it in the shower while your hair is dripping wet, and use a ton more than you thought you needed.  Your curls will hold with zero frizz.  It is amazing
"
"
Originally, I really hated this and thought I had wasted my money. But after several weeks and trying it different ways, I’m now okay with it. I still think my hair feels drier when I use Arc Angel, but at least it is holding curl now. I HAVE to diffuse my hair without heat when using it. Heat =extra dry and frizzy results.Original review: I can’t believe how much I dislike this product. I usually love Devacurl products, but I certainly don’t like this one. My hair looks better if I literally do nothing to it after washing it than the past three days of using Arc Angel. Within 30 minutes my hair is already frizzy, flat, and lifeless. How does a curling gel manage to REMOVE the curl??? I’ll stick with my Ultra Defining Gel. The only positive thing I can say about Arc Angel is that it smells good.

I was recommended this product by a cousin who is a professional hair stylist. This gel is amazing at holding my curls! I naturally have a very slight wave, more towards straight hair, but when it's wet before I brush it, it's slightly wavy. I can use this gel and scrunch my hair and it holds the prettiest curls! The more often I use it, the better the curls look! First photo is me with my naturally straight with a slight single wave hair and a fan who fell asleep at the game. It was a night game and I was outside all day long. Second pic is me with the curls and the lead vocalist of the band Friday Pilots Club. The pic was taken at night and I was at an outdoor music festival all day yet the curls still stayed. Third pic is me and my sister, again with the curls. I had worked all day and then drove an hour to meet her at an outdoor concert in a park and again the curls look great! As you can see, this gel creates curly miracles and my hair still looks flexible, soft, and free all day long!

I have wavy/curly hair and had been using the light weight Deva Curl gel, but wanted to try something with a little more holding power.  Arc Angel is awesome.  It provides good hold and yet still leaves my hair feeling soft.  While the hair is drying, there is a feeling of it being a little crusty, but once it's dry and you scrunch the hair, that cast breaks up and leave the hair feeling great.

I have tried so hard to like this product. I started with the Ultra Defining gel and when that failed I tried the Arc Angel gel. I have 2 C hair and although it doesn't leave it crunchy or hard it had NO HOLD whatsoever. I tried it over and over with different amounts, air dry vs diffusing, also with Deva Super Cream and the results were the same, no good whatsoever. I just don't get the hype over these products. If you want something that works for 2 b or 2 c hair try Jessie Curl Spiralicious gel, best product I have found so far out of the seriously hundreds I have tried.
"
"
I LOVE this gel! I’m new to the curly girl method and Ive seen that a lot of people are constantly trying new products and switching it up but honestly I like this gel I might just stick with it. It is not sticky in between my hands, the scent is not too strong but does leave your hair smelling fresh. I have low porosity hair and use only about a dime size on each side of my head (I have short hair) and that’s enough for me. I use a diffuser and it creates a nice light cast (if I used more i believe it would create more of a cast). And then I scrunch out the crunch using praying hands and it leaves my hair bouncy with nice hold all day but doesn’t even look like I have product in it! Also note, I decided on this deva gel because on their website it stated it would be good for low porosity hair, so I would suggest looking at that to find the one that fits you.
"
"
By far my favorite product ever!!! I switched to all vegan hair products for about a year now and no heat on my hair what so ever. This product gives my hair that extra bounce to my natural long curls and without leaving white flaky stuff. I can touch my hair through out the day without worrying that my curls are going to fall. It gives just the right amount of hold and shine to my curls. Naturally my hair I is curly but frizzy and not a lot of volume. Also this product has a nice light sweet scent. Better than other gels I've used by this brand. Definitely will stick to this one for keeps.
"
"
I like to let my curls dry without brushing them.  The arc angel makes a stiff curl ""cast"" to support the curl formation while the hair dries.  Once the hair is dry, I hang my head upside down and scrunch curls, which breaks the curl cast, and the crunchiness disappears, leaving me with soft, defined curls.  I've been using this method for 6 months now.  I've also been using the same bottle of Arc Angel for 6 months, so while it seemed pricey at first, it's really not.  Product has a light, citrusy scent, but not enough to upset my sensitive scalp.  I will be buying this product again.
"
"
FAKE! I used this for years and thought they changed the formula cause it seemed watered down. It was doing nothing for my hair. Saw my stylist today and she didnt even believe I had product in it. I wish I could return. Dont waste your money.
"
"
Arrived on time / packaged well.This is far from cheap but it’s worth the price. You do not need to use a large amount, it works best is you don’t over do it.Leaves my hair w/a soft bouncy curl. After a shower I use the gel & let my hair air dry. Once it’s almost dry I use a blow dryer on low air flow & high heat (that’s just me folks) and scrunch it lightly to get the soft bounce.This get holds well & smells nice.
"
"
Buyer Beware: I received a fake product. I couldn't understand why my hair was not turning out similar to when it was styled at the salon. Then I noticed that my Arc Angel Gel did not have the same color, consistency or smell as the product sold at my salon. Unfortunately I did not notice this until well after the return period.
"
"
Best gel I have EVER used!! Must put in sopping wet hair while in shower for best effect.
"
"
I purchased about a month ago and gave it 3 solid weeks of use. However after the first few days I noticed how dry my protein sensitive 3A curly hair was becoming, it was awful. I tried applying it in distant ways, etc but I just had to stop using it. The second I speed using this my hair changed back to soft, not dry, and looked healthier again. I'm not sure what was in this product to make my hair react this was but I'd highly caution anyone who has protein sensitive hair to think hard before purchasing. Instead I'd recommend Moptop and Jessicurl products.
"
"
I hate it. My hair felt disgusting. It has a flash drying effect on my hair. I put it on very moisturized slippery wet hair, and my hair started to feel dry and crispy. After it fully air dried my curls looked okay for about 5 minutes. Then I had more frizz around the crown of my head than i have in long time. I have prorein sensitive loose curls and waves, and honestly it hates practically everything. I was really hopeful this would be the one for me and my search would ve over. Guess not
"
"
Packaged Perfect, no leakage, but I’m not sure this product is for me.  It fills my hair.  I will continue to use it, it may be an issue with how much I’m using or how I’m using it ( before leave-in or after).  I will try different ways, to see what works best for my hair.
"
"
My wife uses this DevaCurl several time a week, she has curly and fine hair and it doesn't make her hair look oily or greasy when she uses it and it's not heavy. When she uses it, her hair curls likes she wants it to. I will buy this again when she runs out in a year, this was a great value for what you get.
"
"
I don't know if this is the real stuff or not, but I'm not impressed. It smells like lemon lime Gatorade to start. I've used it a couple times now and followed directions of starting with soaking wet hair and air drying. Meh. Still a frizzy and not much control. My hair still feels dry and I got the same results as using any old gel. For anyone reading this I recommend instead Renpure coconut creme curling jelly. Not as pricey doing the job this gel claims to. Good luck curly girls!
"
"
I purchased this product for the first time through Amazon. I noticed that several other reviewers mentioned receiving the wrong product but I do believe that I got the right one based on the smell and color description.I love this gel! It really defines my curls without making them super crunchy and I am able to add lots of volume with a diffuser without too much frizz. Sometimes I add other products in at the same time, mostly like a conditioner or cream but the gel still helps with volume.
"
"
Beware, this is a fake. I am very familiar with Deva Curl products, have been using them for years. Just received from Amazon, and the color of gel was incorrect, and it smelled. I see others have same complaint, I could not find a way to notify Amazon on this issue. This is clearly a counterfeit and disappointed. I then purchased it direct from Deva Curl, and product arrived perfect. It is a great product.
"
"
LOVE THIS STUFF.  When applying it, I thought it would dry crunchy - but it doesn't!  This stuff is magical!  i used all DevaCurl products now! I have 3A curly hair, fine, but think hair.  Used this with the No Poo cleanser, the DevaCurl conditioner that you like, then the B-Leave DC product, then s little bit of this stuff - and it's AWESOME!
"
"
As I was warned about Amazon vendors watering down the DevaCurl products, the first thing I did when I received this product was compare it to the genuine product. It is noticeably more watery. My DevaCut hairstylist had informed me that genuine DevaCurl products will never be so inexpensive as this, but it’s worth it if you find the products work for you and your meant-to-be-beautiful curls! Returning this bogus crap and ordering the real product!
"
"
I've tried the devacurl line with all the hype about it.......honestly, I have not been happy with the stylesrs.  I like the no poo shampoo and conditioner.......i was not impressed with thos gel.  I first tried the regular gel, but it was like adding thickened, scented water to my hair.  And this one did add a little more hold, but still not what I needed.  I was very excited to try this and wanted to love it, but I did not.
"
"
I love this gel as it does smell good and leaves your hair soft once you break the gel cast. However, as soon as my hair hits any humidity, my frizz comes out and my hair goes up into a bun. I have a deva cut and follow all care/style instructions, use the no poo cleanser and conditioner, super cream, and hairspray and still doesn’t help. If I don’t hit humidity, my hair looks great!
"
"
I’m used to the other Deva gel. This gel left my hair gummy and frizzy. It created frizzy clumps. I applied it as directed to soaking wet hair after leave in conditioner. The other Deva gel works very well in my 3A low porosity curls. This version  has a floral/fabric softener scent, whereas the original version is a sweet/lemongrassy scent.
"
"
I love this stuff and have been using Deva Curl products for over a decade.  They, along with my Deva trained stylist, make all the difference.HOWEVER- the packaging on the shipments leaves much to be desired. These bottles are heavy. They are often packed with either just paper for padding or nothing at all- in boxes that are clearly too large so the bottles jostle around a great deal. In my latest shipment one of the noses on the pump is snapped clean off.  Thankfully, I can transfer the pump from my current bottle. But damage like this is a not infrequent problem. I know other reviewers have mentioned the same kind of issue. Please pack and wrap heavy bottles of expensive product securely so they don’t roll around in the box and end up breakin somehow! Please!
"
"
I really wish this would have worked for me better for my “wash n gos”, I have coily courts (3c-4a type)  it slightly defined my hair and only would last me a day. But it definitely worked fine for twist outs, braid outs and other styles using perm rods or flexi rods leaving my hair soft and lasting about 3-4 days until it becomes a frizz ball. By the way, it smells very citrus. I recommended mostly for those with loose curls and definitely not much for those with type 4a+ (If you are doing a wash n go).
"
"
Product: I love this gel! Great hold and soft curls for my huge hair. Way cheaper than Ouidad climate control @ $60 which has been my staple for 3 years!!Boxing: terrible! By bottle arrived broken due to poor packaging to protect the bottle, the plastic bag it was in saved the product so now I’m using get out of a bag! 😒
"
"
Oh, MAN, I am using products from three different lines that I love! Wen cleansing conditioners, replenishing treatment mists, and body creams are great. Ouidad leave-ins including Whipped Curls are awesome. Then there's THIS Deva Arc Angel Defining gel along with their Low-poo! I really need to figure out something here. I have yet to try Ouidad's Shampoos, and now that I really like this Arc Angel gel, I probably won't try Ouidad stylers. So,  perhaps I should keep doing what I'm doing as long as it works.I can't believe I had this Arc Angel Defining gel in my arsenal of hair supplies for Over three years now! Purchased March 14, 2014 used it once, had flakes and little hold, put it away in a huge plastic zip bag to give away. I did not want to throw it away since I used so little of it. Lately, I have been looking for a styling agent as I prefer a little bit of hold. I had a little bit of Kinky-Curly Curling Custard left from a couple of years ago (never used straight out of jar, just removed some with spoon into another container) that I recently used. I've always had a love and hate with that. It has made my hair stringy, with rubbery crunchiness and left it difficult to dry at my roots. But there were occasional ""good"" days with it. Again, after not using it for approx. two years, I decided to try it again after cleansing with Wen and with Ouidad's leave-ins.  Long story short---You CAN'T mix Kinky-Curly with A-N-Y-thing otherwise you'll have a hot mess....And, the Knot Today leave-in eventually builds up on my hair. Fact is Kinky-Curly is the most all natural thick gelled styler I have ever come across.  I Tried to Make myself use it.  So, I tried Arc Angel again for the second time since I had it. I used Deva Curl Low-Poo followed with Wen as leave-in - then Ouidad Moisture Lock - then Whipped Curls - finally Arc Angel (I flat ironed last winter soooo, the more good things I can put into my hair the better) I have the Deva Green Hand diffuser but I let it air dry. My hair looks great. I used such a small amount of product and got excellent results. It is shiny, Not Crunchy, hard, or stiff. The cast is super light, there really isn't much of a cast to break. In the morning it will be just a fabulous after sleeping on it...I know I should be doing the unicorn/pineapple thing but I'm just not doing that right now as I have a satin pillowcase.The problem when first used may have been due to styling out of the shower (not sure). I came to Amazon to read reviews on this again and found many reviewers stated to use in the shower, and that's what I did! Thanks for your helpful tips!UPDATE: The next day my hair looked and felt great. However....it Flakes on dark clothing, surprisingly not on hair. The flakes are so fine it looks like dandruff or something. Soooo, now I'm thinking that was probably the reason why I only used once and put it away. I still like it as it defines without heaviness. But, what you wear matters with this. Took one star off. :/

I've been using this product on and off for about 4 years now. I typically use it in my hair after I am done showering and then let my hair air dry or use very minimal heat. The more I use the more ""crunch"" I will have to my hair. I have naturally curly hair but they are not super tight curls. I would recommend a try for anyone who wants some hold to their hair with a nice smell to go along with it. The smell isn't overbearing, which is nice. I also use the Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner as well.
"
"
The gel top arrived busted with gel leaking all over; even the plastic covering was broken and the rest of my amazon box was covered. Lost a lot of the product and have a mess to clean.
"
"
I’ve had this product for sometime now.I use it on my hair and started to realize the texture is very different from my other deva curl product. Well that’s because it’s fake! Dont be fooled by the price. This is a watered down gel that is not deva curl arc angel!
"
"
I have 2b/2c hair that loves moisture, so I thought the Arc Angel would be a good fit. Unfortunately, what it adds in moisture it lacks in hold. Mind you, I need a LOT of hold. When I don't put product in my hair, my entire top layer doesn't form curls. As it dries, it slowly inflates to a poofy, formless mass. I find DevaCurl's Ultra Defining Gel to work well when I layer it over Eden Curl Defining Creme and plop for 20 minutes. My curls get the help they need to make reasonably defined ringlets. The Arc Angel just doesn't work for me.
"
"
I love, love, love this gel.  You need to apply it when your hair is soaking wet which takes some getting used to.  You absolutely cannot touch it again until your hair is dry.  My hair takes forever to dry so this is also challenging.  BUT, then when you break the cast and fluff up your hair you will have the best, softest curls ever.  It doesn't feel like you have any product in it at all and your curls last for days.
"
"
I have been using this product for 8 months, smell not the same, hair dried out and felt like straw and it flakes.  this is not the real product.  Cant even mix with a oil.
"
"
I have 3C/4A curls and this gel really doesn’t do much for my hair. If you have hair types similar to mine and like really defined curls I wouldn’t recommend this product. It does define your curls but mine were left fizzy looking and not as defined as I like them. After using this I usually just wear my hair in updos because it’s not defined enough to wear as a wash and go. I do use the entire system so that doesn’t have anything to with my results, this product just doesn’t work for my hair.
"
"
I have thick wavy hair and live in high humidity. Someone recommended this so I tried it.  The person who recommended it has very curly hair of medium thickness.  She loves the softness of it and I’ll give it that, it is soft but Cat Walk Curls Rock works better for me.  I’ll continue to use the remainder of this product for normal styling but if I want to hold a scrunched look I will use the Curls Rock.
"
"
I didn't originally read the reviews because I thought I knew what I was buying, I guess that will teach me next time. I figured I would save money buying thru Amazon than at the salon, but that was a mistake, the product is so runny compared to the thick goopie texture I got from the bottle at the salon. It is not holding my curl like it should.
"
"
I have gotten this product several times. The price is much better then in stores. I have a caucasian background and my curls are soft, ringlets. This product holds without being crunchy. I can wear my curls a couple days with a splash of water to “wake them up” on the non- shower days.I only use this hair jell and defuser.
"
"
I have been using the lighter hold and purchased this to see if it works better. I'd say ""no"" simply because both products work so amazingly well that I want to always have one or the other on hand. This product does not leave your hair sticky or crunchy. It refreshing curls and helps keep them from being frizzy. My curls are from a perm and this defining gel gave them better definition that simply washing and conditioning did. This product is a keeper!
"
"
They refilled this bottle with a different gel. When I finally got around to comparing it to the real thing, the fake product was yellow/clear and food not smell as good. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
"
"
There was a couple oz. lost because it was tPackaged right. I have 2c hair and it is definitely drying compared to ultra defining gel. It smells amazing though. I’ve only used it for a couple weeks. It’s not bad, just not as good as the other gel.
"
"
The bottle top wasnt screwed on all the way or shut and the gel is everywhere! I really wanted to try this because i hear nothing but good things about it and this seller sounds legit with the brand. Help me pleasee! I cant send this mess back. This sucks😔
"
"
Watched several video tutorials and followed all tips and cannot get this to work for my hair. Actually made my hair frizzier, very little hold, flaked pretty badly, and smells like dishwasher detergent. Not worth the money in my opinion.
"
"
So far im not super in love with the way it makes my hair feel dry  will keep useing and trying to keep my moisture  up and se if it gets better...  other than making my hair feel dry it has great hold and curl  in my hair
"
"
My curls did not react as expected with this product, I really do not love what I felt and also leaves me a strange feeling in the hair texture does not feel good at all, I usually mix it with another product deva just to not have that texture...
"
"
This gel is not great for my 3B curls.  It has great hold but it leaves my curls feeling crunchy and dry.  I love DevaCurls cream gels better for my curl type.
"
"
I am very disappointed in this product. I have used deva curl for years and it is evident  that the conditioner has been watered down. It’s super liquidity and does not do a good job of creating the curls. I compared the conditioner with a remaining bottle of deva curl conditioner that I had, and there is a clear difference in the comsidency. The cleanse is just fine and works like usual, but the condition does not suffice.
"
"
This keeps my curl shape so well!! I use it along side B-leave in and I’m obsessed!! Love devacurl so much!! And I’ve read reviews saying this isn’t authentic, but mine definitely is.
"
"
Finally found something that my curly hair loves without drying it out.  I can not say enough positive things about the Deva Care system.  I have gone through 40 years having to wash my hair every day because the hair products I was using was making my hair dirty, frizzy and and dried out.  Someone recommend I try the deva care system, said ""You need to stop treating your hair like it is Caucasian as it isn't).  I started using deva care and I get continuous compliments as well as only having to wash my hair every 4 days.  My hair hasn't been happier since!
"
"
I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls. I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren't any better than their cheaper counterparts. Don't waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products. Head to Target for the same type of shampoo, Frizz-Free stuff, gel & condition without bruising your credit card. My opinion only, but I've found better products for my curly hair at Ross', TJ Max and Marshalls. Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz. It's cheap & it works.
"
"
Not sure what all the hype was about with this stuff. It seems to be the holy grail for all the curly girls, but it didn't do much for my 2b/c hair but left it feeling gritty.
"
"
I was excited to try this but alas, I was extremely disappointed. It makes my hair very frizzy and my curls are not defined at *all*. I tried it with frizz reducing cream, as I usually use gels, and still my hair was frizzy and undefined. It also seems to have a weird residue and I'll have to wash it today after using it for 2 days (usually I only wash my hair a few times a month). Yes it smells good but smell does not make my curls appealing! I'm actually going to try and return it and try a different product. I have much better luck with Garnier Fructise natural gel.
"
"
This stuff is amazing! I heard about this through a friend and had to try it. I have very curly, soft hair. When I use other firm gel products, my hair becomes crunchy or straw like. If I use the flexible gel, my hair is too frizzy with undefined curls. I do advise you to use it directly as stated in the directions. Your hair will have a stuff cast on it that you will need to scrunch once it is dry to break the cast and create beautiful, soft, defined curls. I also purchased the shampoo and conditioner but have not used it yet. Waiting until my other products run out. Once I am using all Deva Care products, I can't imagine the improvement!
"
"
I love this gel and buy it quite often.  However, this time I was disappointed because some of the product had leaked out inside the packaging.  That hadn't happened before.  You might want to check the packaging you're using.  Thanks.
"
"
I have VERY curly hair but is fine. I don't like it to be fuzzy or weighed down. This is the first pump jel, rather than spray gel, that I love.
"
"
This one is a gamechanger! I just started the curly girl method, and this product is by far the best I've discovered. Trick is to use a lot more than you might think. Get your hair totally coated. Don't scrunch out the crunch until fully dry.
"
"
This gel is nothing like arc angel.. Smells ok but defiantly watered down.  When compared to the one I purchased from Ulta, totally different.  No hold and frizz like crazy.  I love deva curl and have been using for years.  This is NOT the real thing..
"
"
for the past year i have used this brand but this particular product is horrible as all it does is cause flakes making a mess
"
"
I had been using the DevaCurl Ultra defining gel until is finished and I wasn't that thrilled with it. It left my hair rough and unmanageable. However, after making the change to Arc Angel Control, my curls hold for a lot longer without the rough texture. I love this gel and couldn't recommend it enough.
"
"
I haven’t used gel in the past because I was afraid it would weigh my hair down, but I’ve been trying new products and this one was absolutely amazing!!!! I’ve only been using it for less than a week and have gotten so many compliments on my hair! This gel gives me soft, yet defined curls. Doesn’t leave my hair with a sticky residue either. Wish it were a little cheaper, but it’s worth the money!
"
"
This gel has a good hold however, on my hair it didn’t last long but it could have been that I used a leave in underneath. The consistensy is very liquidy and it has a citrus aroma. It dries with a cast but can be removed with an oil or cream.
"
"
Smells like citrus but thats all thats really good about it. I noticed my hair began breaking off while using this
"
"
I have curly, coarse hair. This product holds it in place without stickiness. You have to finger comb the product thru totally wet hair, scrunch, let dry.
"
"
This stuff might work if you never have frizz problems but if you have curly hair that you're looking to tame keep searching.  This gel is thin.  No matter how much I put in it won't keep my naturally curly corkicelli hair from looking like I have a second type of hair haloing my head.  I was expecting more from a product from the writer of the book I read that taught me how to properly care for my curls.  I'm giving up on this gel after using it for a few days.  I'll have to go back to my cheap Aussie gel until I find something better. :( Positive- Smells good.- Low toxin levels, great EWG score.Negative- Doesn't control frizz at all.- Very thin consistency.
"
"
Great product. Exactly as described. Came well packaged.Does a beautiful job with my curly hair.
"
"
We love this product for our curly hair.  The best we’ve used and we’ve tried a lot.  My teenage daughter is happy!
"
"
Moldy shampoo?!?? I’m not sure how this is even a thing! I purchased this last year (I don’t use a ton of shampoo so this lasts a while!!) and today while showering I noticed it was dark color and picked it up to discover mold!!! I don’t know how long it’s been that way which really disturbs me! I’ve never had this problem before, but I’ll be thinking twice about ordering again.
"
"
This is a great product to get smooth curls that don’t frizz. Smells great and the price was very good.
"
"
Smells great but my hair got real frizzy. Thinned out. I started getting dry spots on my scalp.
"
"
I love that you can get this on Amazon this gel is AMAZING for my 3b-3c some 4 A curls that are frizzy and often dehydrated. This helps to define my curls and make them luscious and frizz free! The shipping is fast,the customer service is good, love the big size.. all perfect.
"
"
I have thick blonde curly hair that was prone to fizzing. For some reason all of the expensive hair products I was using such as Oribe and Davines was not helping. I did my usual research on Amazon and found the reviews on this, the DevaCare No Poo and Conditioner and this Angel Firm Defining gel, it worked wonders on my hair and I was able to wear it curly again. Definitely would recommend this to anyone experiencing fizzy unmanageable hair. I still have a few bad hair days when the weather is really humid but overall this has made a huge difference.
"
"
The product came in the correct packaging. But once I went to use it, I found that it was watery and not a gel content. The smell is also not as strong as it should be. This is a false product.
"
"
My hair seems to be more frizzy with this product,  I like the original much better, I stopped using it for now and using a less expensive gel that works much better
"
"
I like this gel because it doesn't leave a lot of buildup on my hair.  I use it for my wash and go hairstyle.  It really makes the curls pop and  my 4a hair  is soft not hard and crunchy.
"
"
Not the real stuff, don't buy.
"
"
My hair still frizzes when i use this unless i use an INSANE AMOUNT of product which weighs my hair down and makes it look really wet and drippy.
"
"
I have used this product before and something was funny about it this time. It looked and smelled the same but not quite.... the bottle looked cheaper, the gel had a more watery consistency and was separating, and it didn't hold half as well as the one I bought from the store. I wouldn't trust buying this product online, particularly from this seller.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl Arc angel for 8 years. I took a chance and ordered it from Amazon. Well I should have listened to the other reviews. This is NOT real. Doesn’t smell right or have even close to the real consistency of the real Arc Angel
"
"
Hold my messy curly mane in check without feeling sticky.  Smells great!
"
"
I'm a hair stylist and this gel is awesome. Massive shine and will not leave your hair feeling dirty. Can revert hair in the morning and resctivates .
"
"
This did not work as well as I was expecting given the reviews. My hair is very thick and dry so I was got this gel hoping it would hold in extra moisture and define my curls. Immediately after putting it into my sopping wet hair (as suggested) it began to frizz and strands began to separate instead of stick together. Considering my hair was wet, it's a bad sign that this gel was already making my hair frizzy. When it dried it did not form a curl cast and left my hair frizzy and dry and sticky. Would not recommend.
"
"
As expected! Perfect and convenient! Works great if use as directed. Worth the price.
"
"
I love this product for my naturally wavy hair. It leaves my waves soft, not crunchy and doesn’t feel like i have a ton of product in my hair. I keep trying new products and wind up coming right back to deva curl.
"
"
Have been using the smaller bottle thought it was time to switch for the value size. Definitely worth it.
"
"
Gel works really well. Do not like the scent I’ve noticed all the deva products smell pretty bad.
"
"
It’s ok. It was definitely cheaper on Amazon than elsewhere
"
"
I've been using DevaCurl for a few years and this is NOT the Arc Angel Control Styling Gel. I had thought something was wrong so I purchased the same product locally and it was completely different. Too bad my return/refund window closed. It took me a while to figure it out. I am furious and feel duped.
"
"
I bought the jumbo bottle and less than half way through the bottle, it is not even gel anymore. It is the consistency of water and is not doing the job of gel. Total rip off.  I will never by devacurl products from Amazon again.
"
"
Holds hair well.  Smells really good and lasts
"
"
I have found other products I like better for curly hair days.
"
"
This gel works really well! I love the level of hold and definition I get when I use it!
"
"
I love this stuff. This is the only gel that holds my curl shape in his humid Houston weather and doesn’t make them all hard and crunchy.
"
"
After few weeks using this product my hair started to feel dry and elastic. Not favorite product for natural curls.
"
"
This is my favorite gel ever. I have worn my hair curly for decades now and this is the only gel that feels soft, holds my curl, and never flakes.
"
"
smells amazing. Doesn't seem to hold my curls anymore then a store bought brand.
"
"
This is not a genuine product. It is much thinner than the salon gel, almost watery, does not smell like the salon stuff, more like lemon lime drink, and dries out hair. Don't waste your money and buy direct from DevaCurl or the salon. What a joke.
"
"
I knew this would be a low poo shampoo but it still seems like you need way to many pumps of shampoo to get enough to clean your hair.  I feel like my scalp doesn’t smell clean after washing with a lot of shampoo.  I also feel, after 2-3 weeks of use, that there is a waxy buildup on my hair.
"
"
I know this product is supposed to be for people with curly hair, but I just had to give it a try.  I have long, straight caucasian hair.  A hair stylist told a friend of mine with short straight hair that Deva Curl products would make her hair curl.  She tried it and it worked. It gave her waves and body.  So, I had to give it a try.  I have hair where a couple pieces curl in the rain but that's about it.  I bought Deva Curl Low Poo, Deva Curl One Conditioner, and Deva Care Arc Angel Gel.  After using the cleanser and conditioner, I dried my hair with a towel and combed it out.  I could see waves starting to happen.  I scrunched in the Arc Angel Gel, and I had waves and body.  I really couldn't believe it.  It made my straight fine hair look wavy, almost like I had a body perm.  It can also give that slightly messy, wind blown look.This gel has a strong hold and gives nice body.  Your hair still has bounce and freedom to move.  It does not leave your hair stiff and brittle.  I plan to use it when I use my rollers to curl my hair next time.  I think it will give it great hold without that crunchy feeling.My mother has shoulder length, straight, thin, baby fine caucasian hair that is damaged and color treated.  She is hooked on this gel.  It gives her hair fullness and body.  It doesn't curl her hair, but it makes her hair look fuller and lay better.  Without it, her hair looks stringy and uncombed.  She has no natural curl at all, but I have some and I think that's why it curls my hair and not hers.
"
"
Great holding power, great smell
"
"
I liked this product. I use it to curl my hair. Very good product.
"
"
This gel leaves my hair soft and frizz free. It smells great kinda citrus like.
"
"
A total waste of money. My hair was dry and the product flakes when dry and that was wash day. The next day looked just like the bad hair videos for this product on YouTube.
"
"
Someone watered this gel down. It's like water. The consistency and feel are not the same as I have purchased from other places.
"
"
Works great. Smells nice. Have noticed that it can be a bit drying on the hair ends over time. I have problems with conditioners giving me rashes if I use too much or leave too much product in my hair, so it is a problem keeping my hair moisturized. I can't use Deva Care's No or Low Poo because of breakouts/rashes, but I have really sensitive skin and lots of allergies to all kinds of products.
"
"
I've tried so many gels but this one is really the best. It smells so good and has such a great, soft hold. My curls look soft but defined. The price may seem more up there but the bottle really does last
"
"
The best for fine curly hair. Light weight non sticky fast drying and easy to use.
"
"
I love it thank you. It makes my hair so beautiful
"
"
This product does it hold styles  as much a geldies  but neither does it leave a hard gelcap like the other gela do. However it is a good product and does it’s job.
"
"
Love this gel! Holds my crazy curls while keeping the crunch away.
"
"
I have crazy curly hair and DevaCurl is the ONLY thing that works! Less frizz and my curls look awesome!
"
"
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter, but we both love this product. Leaves your hair soft, curly and no crunch.
"
"
I have dry curly, frizzy hair that is difficult to manages in Florida's humid hot weather. My cousin has long curly hair that looks gorgeous all the time. She highly recommended the entire Deva Curl line. I love that it's a natural product not tested on animals, that's simple to use and WORKS!Once I understand the technique it transformed my hair routine and saved me 45 minutes of blow drying my hair.A purchase you'll never regret!
"
"
This product came highly recommended. I was disappointed as it was expensive and left my hair frizzier than normal. I would not recommend.
"
"
Great gel.  Love that after your hair dries, you scrunch again to release the cast and soft curls stay.  I used to only use Paul Mitchell sculpting foam but this is now my go to.  You really cannot use too much.
"
"
Love it
"
"
I love the product itself. Works great for my daughters curls. However the packaging was a little bad. The gel was open a little and not sure how much fell out but the top of bag is covered with gel.
"
"
Got my product today and the pump was broken. The product is too bulky to use without the pump.
"
"
Best for wavy curls
"
"
Helps curls looking smooth but still curly. Eliminates the frizz
"
"
This is the only DevaCare/Curl product that I will probably buy again.It really works great in my curly hair.I apply it to wet hair and let it air dry.It generally does a great job holding my curls together and prevents frizzing.The only thing is it does not really last the whole day. I will notice that at the end of the day, my hair is quite frizzy.
"
"
Great for natural curly hair
"
"
Nice, came fast.
"
"
Love this stuff . Not flaky on hair and a good smell ! Does not make hair hard and gives it a nice curl
"
"
It left my hair feeling too hard.
"
"
I love the product yet this is my second purchase that had a defective pump. Some gel gets wasted every time I use the pump.
"
"
Love the curls
"
"
Works great in hair!
"
"
great product, great price
"
"
You have to know how to use it..In the shower after finger combing your hair with conditioner, lightly rinse with cold water.Scrunch this through your hair, and use A LOT!Then scrunch with a microfiber cloth and try to let it air dry after that.Once its completely dry it will be hard, just crunch the stiffness out of your hair and your ready to go!
"
"
This was a counter fit product! It is not as thick and is more orange in color. Also I have not had a good hair day because this doesn’t work like the real thing, next time I’m sending it back. I know what to look for. Gold Fifillmrnt had been mentioned before for selling counterfeit products and it’s TRUE!!!!
"
"
Staple product. Gives my hair great definition.
"
"
love love love using this for my tight curls. I combine this product (because its so expensive) with Cantu curling cream to make the product last longer. always remember to break the mold of devacurl or your curls will be crunchy!
"
"
I have super curly, frizzy, unruly hair - and I live in the South, home of humidity. Deva Curl is THE BEST product I've ever used for curly hair. It will transform your hair.
"
"
Good defining gel don't apply more than a dime size or will cause flakiness when dry smell good
"
"
not the correct product—wrong color, smell, and texture. Looks and feels more like the light defining gel. Also looks like someone filled the bottle—it's not full to the top like my previous purchase, which was the right product.
"
"
If I could give a one star I would. Product leaked out of packaging when it was delivered. I should have known not to use it but I did anyway. It smelled horrible and was so runny it was like water. As soon as I used I knew it wasn’t a real Devacurl product.
"
"
I was introduced to Deva products 2 yrs ago.  I will never switch!!1. Use No Poo Shampoo2. Follow with One Conditioner3. Style with the BEST GEL ... Arc Angel4. Dry with Deva Dryer or let air dry.That's all you will ever need to make your curls look their best.People will stop you and comment on how great your hair looks.  Who could ask for anything more.
"
"
I've used Deva products for a few years now and I'll never look back. My hair has totally changed for the better. I went shampoo-free for the first time three years ago and the Deva line helped me do it.Has enough hold to give me the definition and volume that I like, non-sticky, no residue, really clean orange-ey smell. Always been safe on my hair color.Can load up when I want really individual defined curls without being too heavy and when I'm bumming around a little bit does the trick.Deva for life!!!
"
"
Leaves hair feeling nice & forming nice natural curls
"
"
I've been buying this product for a couple of years now and I have loved it for my curly hair HOWEVER, this last bottle I received is different.  The formula seems to have changed and it's much more watery. I have to use twice as much as I ever did before.  I'm hoping it's just a fluke and the next bottle will be back to normal.  If it's not, I will not buy it again.
"
"
Having read other reviews the key is to buy from a specific reseller. Amazon lists the reviews of the product from all sellers and clearly quality varies by re-seller.  I used C Beauty and the gel was thick and my bottle came with a pump top.  I suggest buying from them to make sure you get a quality product.
"
"
this is one of the BEST gels that i found/use, the only thing that i didn't like when i received my order in the mail is that the bottle was leaking and 1/3 of the gel was in the plastic bag... what a waste! :(The product and brand is GREAT!
"
"
Perfect for my curls. Just remember to blow dry after!
"
"
Definitely had been manually refilled, and not even all the way to the top. Pump wasn’t fully screwed on and was sticky. Worth buying from another more reputable seller in the future. Love the gel itself, but beware with buying on Amazon!
"
"
I love this product.  Decent price for such a big bottled and arrived right on time.
"
"
Love the hold, love the definition, love the lite feeling. For a ultra holding gel, it's not like a thick gel at all! You get your hold and definition, but also moveable curls. No flaking at all. Glad I got this instead of the lite gel.
"
"
This does not leave my hair feeling the same way that the arcc angel that I buy from the salon feels like which was disappointing because I bought a huge bottle and I'm not even using it. My hair ends up being crunchy.
"
"
Makes my hair sticky
"
"
I love this gel. It holds and defines my 2-3b wavy-swavy hair perfectly without being hard or crunchy. I use a lot initially, then on day 2 and 3 I dampen my hair with wet hands, add one squirt of gel, and re-scrunch. Flawless! I've tried lots of other Deva products, though, and this is really the only one I like. Highly recommended!
"
"
good
"
"
Great value compared to salons.  Great product.
"
"
Great for my curls!
"
"
Definitely a ""no crunch"" gel. But I loved the results I got when I used it.
"
"
This is not the correct product - this is deva light hold gel in a firm gel bottle. Bottles are sticky and leaking like they were refilled. Really shady
"
"
I don't know why I was expecting more from this product.  I guess it was all of the glowing reviews.Don't expect some miracle curly hair product. It literally is just another hair gel and works just like any hair gel. It makes your hair stiff and leaves your hair dry and with residue.For the price,  if this is what you want from a hair product,  just skip this product and go for cheap drug store hair gel.
"
"
I like the consistency of it but it does leave a slight crunch even after you scrunch your hair once it dries.
"
"
This gel left my hair feeling like straw and there was no hold. Also, it took weeks for my hair to recover after using this product just once, as it completely stripped my hair of it's moisture. I was very disappointed.
"
"
Wow what a difference!!! I've been trying out the curly girl method on my curls and tried this product for the first time last night.  I woke up this morning with beautiful ringlets that I haven't seen for years now! This product doesn't leave a hard cast on my hair, and it doesn't weigh my hair down.  I would recommend in a heart beat!
"
"
I have naturally curly hair that is thinning as I get older. This gel was way too heavy for my hair even though I applied the smallest amount. I even tried wetting my hands really good and pouring a little into my hands to thin out the gel; it still weighed down my hair. If you have really thick hair this might be good for you. I won't purchase again.
"
"
Deva Curl Arc Angel is a great for curly hair. It adds needed moisture and structure to your curls that adds fullness and staying power all day.
"
"
I have very curly hair, DEVA is a wonderful product. Help keep the frizz out and gives beautiful curls.
"
"
I have ridiculously soft curly hair. It gets frizzy very easily. This product helps maintain the shape and frizz in a way I never thought possible. My curls are tight and maintain their shape all day, no matter how many times I push my hair back. I highly recommend this product, including the Nopoo and conditioner.
"
"
I love the way it makes my hair feel!
"
"
Not devacurl. DevaCARE. Super thin and works just ok.
"
"
I have been using this gel for many years and glad I can find the large size here.  I have very very thick very curly hair.  With this I end up with nice curls and it doesn't feel sticky or hard/crunchy.  I use several of Deva's products and they work well for my hair, a great line of products.
"
"
I was using ultra defining gel and decided to give this a try. I like it better! It's more moisturizing. It's a great gel for curly hair!!
"
"
This product reduces frizz and leaves hair soft and manageable.
"
"
This is a FAKE product. I have used this product for years and this is not the right gel. It is the wrong color and the wrong consistency. It is like water coming out of the pump, rather than a gel. So disappointed.
"
"
Before purchasing this gel, i was using the deva curl ultra defining gel and I loved it but wanted a gel with a little more hold. I wouldn't recommend this gel bc it felt heavy and actually made my hair look frizzier and dull. I'm going back to the ultra defining gel for sure.
"
"
I use deva products all the time. My only complaint is the packaging. The squeeze bottles are very difficult to squeeze. They should really change that or add a pump.
"
"
Perfect hold
"
"
The best gel ever! I highly recommend to anyone that wants to do a wash and go hairstyle.
"
"
Was good but just not for my hair at all. this is ideal for people with hair on the dry side, since mine is naturally moisturized it just over moisturized it. I’m sticking with the ultra defining gel.
"
"
The scent is great and really holds it together WITHOUT the crunch!!
"
"
Product came with a portion of the gel missing and the whole outside of the pump was sticky with gel.
"
"
I like that the product is good but the bottles pump did not work. The pump is stuck to the bottom and can't pull up at all. It makes it hard for me to get the product out of the bottle.
"
"
I night this for my kids who have curly hair. The smell is a little weird but I got past it. Pop  What I do t like is that I feel like it dries out the hair and it does not add any shine. It makes the hair look dry. I normally have add a shine serum to it. I like the consistency of it but not sure if I'll buy again.
"
"
I really like the gel for my curls, leaves the curls looking natural and not stiff.  Will buy this product again.
"
"
Wife loves the stuff.
"
"
it makes the hair very crunchy. it lasts for 2 days. not what I was looking for.
"
"
DC products destroyed my hair and scalp. Please use caution if considering any DC products!
"
"
Great curl definition without the crunch.
"
"
I’m an avid DevaCurl user and I’m very familiar with the product. Arc Angel gel is a peach color and the product I received was colorless. Beware!
"
"
The one I received was far more watery than normal ArcAngel is. It works okay, but is liquidy and drippy instead of a firm gel like usual, as though it has been watered down.
"
"
Deva Curl Arc-angell really helps my fine hair keep well-defined curls.  I use it when on sopping wet hair before putting a micro fiber towel around my head.  My curls are always soft and defined and feel good to the touch.  I will continue to want and buy this product and recommend it for curly hair.
"
"
This is cheap gel in a DevaCurl bottle. It was opened, no seal, and taped with packing tape. So sad that someone has to scam off of other people.
"
"
This is my favorite gel from DevaCurl, has strong hold and is not crunchy when it dries
"
"
I’ve used this product many times but this time the gel is very watery. Maybe it’s a bad batch or old but it’s basically not worth using :/
"
"
Arrived very nicely packaged and looks and smells like the real deal. This was a bargain for sure!
"
"
I've been using this product for years. It holds my curl well with minimum frizz.
"
"
Smells like mandarin oranges, dries out your hair a little but that’s all hair gel.
"
"
This is nothing look like the original devacurl product and it is is being changed a lot in quality this change my hair texture at all it make it look dry and not curl / very disappointed
"
"
My hair looks amazing using these products!
"
"
I use this product every day. I wash my hair one or two times a week and condition every day. This arc angel gel holds my curls nicely and all day with no frizz. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I've found.
"
"
I've been using this product for approximately 7 yrs and I have ordered from amazon almost the entire time. I have never been disappointed with this product and I highly recommend it to others.
"
"
I am not a fan of this product at all. It does not deliver on the promise of a firm hold, nor is is particularly moisturizing. There are much better products at this price point. I'll try to find creative ways to endure the rest of this bottle.
"
"
The production itself it's ok, but it arrived open and spilled all over the bag. Plus, the tip to pour the product is broken.
"
"
I really love this product.  My hair is very fine an this product does not weigh it down at all.  Wish i had found it sooner.
"
"
Pump was broken into pieces. Glad I had my last bottle to replace the new pump.
"
"
Smellnis so so. Works well , not sticky
"
"
Stopped controlling frizz. Loss of curl definition. I will not be finishing the bottle (only used 1/4 of it!)
"
"
Great product but a little pricey.
"
"
Strong hold yet light weight doesn't way my curls down like other gels,  I love it. My husbands uses it too.
"
"
There was no seal or markings that the bottle was new, so I was a little hesitant- but the product seems to do what it claims!
"
"
Love this stuff! I've tried everything for Curly Hair for South FL weather and this stuff really works against normal ""BAD HAIR DAYS"".
"
"
Best products for curly hair
"
"
I went to a Diva salon where they used the Deva products on my hair. Amazing curls, but my hair was sticky and soo strong smelling I could hardly stand it. So I was hesitant to buy any of the products even though my curls were beautiful. After reading a ton of reviews I concluded the sticky may have been coming from the Mirrors glosser and the smell either from that as well or the shampoo. I purchased the One Conditioner and this Arc Angell and am more than happy. No strong smell, no stickiness. I just use another brand gloss. Air drying even looks nice, but carefully using a diffusing dryer really makes my 3a 3b curls pop. Not a fan of 2nd day hair yet, but 1st day hair is awsome.
"
"
Not sure if it's the real thing or not. I have tried some of there other products not the Angel gel but just seems like it may be a knock off. Does work some what to get a two star rating.
"
"
Love the product. Shipping fail. Came punctured and leaking everywhere.
"
"
Great
"
"
This product is exceptional for defining curls without any white film or hard cast. I’m in love with this gel! My curls haven’t looked better!
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Bottle wasn't closes well and leaked into the bag
"
"
Since going to the Curly Girl method, I've tried lots of products. So far, this is the best gel for my fine, low porosity 2B-3A hair.
"
"
This is the only gel that truly shows my curl pattern at it's best. It's very light but has a great hold. The smell is amazing.
"
"
Love it ! Works great on my hair and it smells good too.
"
"
The best gel for people with very curly hair.
"
"
My favorite DevaCurl product! Consistency isn’t gooey and it doesn’t weigh down the curl. The scent is nice.
"
"
The devacurl system is amazing and I've never had better curls but this particular gel is a little to hard for me.
"
"
Great hold for curls without stiffness or drying like other gels!
"
"
I was born with curly hair and always did everything I could to straighten it out. It always looked messy when left natural until I found this product. Now my curls look natural and defined. The added plus of staying in place.
"
"
Loooooove love love this stuff i bought for my (almost) 2yr olds crazy unruly curls & its like magic😁 & a little goes along way with this product! I loove it!
"
"
This is is great gel!!! I use it with the No Poo shampoo and conditioner and they work great together. I will definitely be buying this again!
"
"
Smells great- very citrusy. However it didn't have the right hold - for me.  I have 3A, B curls, high porosity, and my hair was great at first, but got very frizzy as the day went on.
"
"
This gel works great on freshly washed wet hair or dry hair for a mid-day pick-me-up. I LOVE the curl control Deva Care Arc Angel gel provides for my sometimes unruly natural curls!!!
"
"
I love DevaCurl products. I have 3c curls and they are at times uncontrollable. While this product is more expensive it really does the job and is worth it. I would advise buying it at Ulta or wherever they sell it and spend the extra 10 dollars. The product I received was watered down and did not do the same job. The consistency was even watery, gel should not be watery.
"
"
The cap was off and it leaked in packaging... a gooey mess
"
"
Product is very runny. I’ve bought this before. It should not be runny. It has either been diluted by the seller or is old.
"
"
Received product in great condition. This stuff is AMAZING!!
"
"
Makes my curls beautiful but dry and unpleasant to touch
"
"
Love this product
"
"
I have very curly and frizzy hair and this is the first product I've tried that controlled the curl but didn't leave my hair crunchy.  I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion to just wrap hair in a towel after applying product  I slept with the towel on overnight to let my hair dry.  I work up with defined curls with a very soft texture.  It controlled about 90% of the frizz and lasted a couple days.
"
"
wow, this stuff is great!
"
"
Mis rizos quedan geniales con este producto...
"
"
Will definitely buy the bigger bottle next time. great hold without being sticky or too hard, scrunches out perfectly. No build up!
"
"
Awesome
"
"
Holds curls well and doesn't feel greasy.  Works best when applied to dripping wet hair.  Drawback is that it doesn't hold for a long time- by the end of the day my curls are pretty lifeless and hair gets a little frizzy.
"
"
Great product for the price
"
"
Don't buy! I've used Deva products for over a decade. This stuff is watered down to the point that it runs through your fingers like water.
"
"
Great product for curly / wavy hair. Recommended!
"
"
Finally, I have found a product that I can control my curls with. No grease, no ""crunchies"", no separation.  Don't need to apply a lot of it either!
"
"
I am a curly girl.  I like Deva products.  I use Deva products.  I was pumped when I saw that Arc Angel came in a huge bottle with a pump.Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel, 32-Ounce BottleWhen the bottle arrived at my doorstep, I took everything out of the box, but there was no pump. Please do not add accessories, like a pump, to the picture if that is not what is actually going to be sent.  It is misleading and it made me sad.  Also, the packaging people put a very sticky tape over the top of the cap.  That made me slightly more sad.
"
"
My hair is so healthy since I started using this.
"
"
Love the product. Hate that my bottle came broken
"
"
Very satisfied. Not greasy, yet provides a good amount of hold without making the hair feel prickly and stiff.  Good product.
"
"
It works for my curly hair.
"
"
It came broken. Spill all over the box
"
"
I am a woman over 40 with naturally curly, mixed race hair.  I have spent decades trying to find the right mix of products to tame the curls and keep them soft, shiny and frizz free.  This product blows me away.  My curls are beautiful and bouncy all day (and often into the next).  For best results, on humid days, I use the gel liberally and let air dry or diffuse.  Once dry, simply scrunch hair for soft and defined curls.  (I would also recommend using the techniques in the Curly Girl book - you can find here on Amazon).  The gel has a light, fresh scent and can be reactivated later in the day by simply misting with water if needed.My hair has never looked better or been healthier than when I started using this product line.  I will not go back to silicone, paraben or sulfate based products ever.  I highly recommend this to anyone who asks me about what I use on my hair (and I am asked or complimented often).  I can't say enough about this gel...it's amazing.
"
"
Just received the Arc Angel Gel with a broken pump and the bottle isn’t full! There’s no gel in the bag 🤔.
"
"
Works as gel without being crunchy
"
"
what can i say?  i love these products.  i have curly hair and have been using these deva products for nearly 13 years.  old faithful customer.  great smell.  no harsh chemicals.
"
"
Good product, but the pump attachment doesn't work. It also arrived with some leakage from the bottle and the plastic wrap was punctured by the tip of the pump, it seemed. So it arrived in a messy condition and is messy to use, but I like the gel itself.
"
"
Works! Good curl definition.
"
"
This is a wonderful product when used on your wet hair to give your curly hair an even curlier look which stays looking good for a week! It Is amazing!
"
"
I like this product but thought it would be thicker. It doesn't need to be thicker just thought because it is firm hold it would be thicker. Deva sell 2 other gels ""ultra defining gel"" and ""light defining gel"" both of these are thick gels so they are easier to manage. You can put this gel in fridge to thicken but shouldn't have to do this. So I don't love it but I like it enough to keep buying it.
"
"
I like this product it works better than any gel product I've ever used. However, it does leave a sticky residue on my hands. Could be better.
"
"
Use it when your hair is DRIPPING wet.
"
"
I like this.  It only takes a little and it bring curls.  A big bottle like this lasts a long time.
"
"
I believe this product was watered down by the company. The consistency is like water and the original seal has been removed
"
"
Everyone loved my natural look.
"
"
Love this product
"
"
My daughter loves all the Deva Curl products for her beautiful curly hair
"
"
i have been using these products for a few years now and i still love how my curls hold without getting crunchy or dry.
"
"
This product gives my S-wavy curls great definition without being crunchy or looking like they have too much ""goop"" on them.Witchy
"
"
My stylist recommended this product after I got my first perm.  It's annoying that you have to apply it to wet hair and then let it air dry completely besides giving it a few scrunches with a towel.  My long hair takes so long to dry!  I admit that my waves/curls look nice when I am patient enough to let them air dry 100% but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with medium to long hair.  My stylist said I could try using a diffuser and drying my hair to 80% then letting it air dry the rest of the way but I haven't experimented with that yet.
"
"
Expensive, but it works!
"
"
Made by the original ""curly girl"" lady. this gel really tames my frizz without completely discouraging my curls. It lasts longer than most other products, even in humid weather. Love it!
"
"
Cap was loose so some of the gel leaked out and was all over the inside of the bag holding the bottle.
"
"
Fake
"
"
I just received this product and it was open. The gel spilled all over the bottle and the box.
"
"
This item is NOT deva curl. It has been altered by the seller in order to sell at a discount.
"
"
I can't remember how many times I've bought this... It works wonders on my hair and it's not sticky / difficult to apply. Highly recommended!
"
"
I absolutely LOVE this product
"
"
I have fine but very curly hair, this product is very drying.  A creme curl definer (curls rock) and pantene mousse for curly hair works very well, even on humid days.
"
"
I LOVE DEVACURL! Turned my frizzy mop hair into gorgeous defined curls. I never used to wear my hair down and now that I'm 22, I finally feel beautiful with my natural hair.
"
"
Love this product.  Came the very next day.  Great selling point for me!
"
"
Did not work
"
"
I had the experience that most of the one star reviewers had. I have been looking for a miracle  hair product to keep my hair in line. I have vey thick very coarse very dry curly/wavy hair. I live in the Pacific north west so I am battling frizz on a near daily basis. This product had so many good reviews I decided to try it ignoring the bad reviews. Well this is what happened:1. My hair felt like I poured glue all over it.2. My hair hadn't felt that dry in years.3. My hair puffed out and looked huge (which is not something that my already enormous hair benefits from) with awful curls that looked like I had a perm.4. I had to wash my hair twice to remove all the product ruining the months it took to normalize the oils in my hair.This product is worse than the really cheap hair products I used years ago. It is NOT worth the money!!!! AVIOD. As a side note I have been trying many hair products as of late and have had the best luck the jane carter products. They make my hair look and feel nice.
"
"
love it, works great on my out of control hair.
"
"
Great Product for Curly hair
"
"
I had no idea how good this product was til I tried it the first time.  It works!  I have wavy curly hair and it defines and hydrates the curl and so my wavy hair is even more wavy curly.
"
"
defines curls and feels very soft and manageable
"
"
I purchased this last week and been using it for almost a week and it really doesn't do well for curly hair. If your hair type is dry,wavy,frizzy and curly pass on this product.
"
"
great hair product for curly hair! some of the best!
"
"
I love this gel, although it doesn't smell as great as it could.  (To each his own.)  It holds my stubborn hair without making it ""crunchy"".
"
"
Not original Deva curl.. its by the name deva care.. DISAPPOINTED!!
"
"
Above my expectation. The gel is working great with my curly hair and it smells wonderful. I have 2b/2/c hair type.
"
"
Product is great best value!
"
"
I started using this after going to a stylist that was taught to cut curly hair by the creator of the Deva line and I am now a fan. I had always put gel on after getting out of the shower but I was told to lock in the curl its best to apply it while still in the shower and hair is still really wet, I definitely see a big difference and recommend this method.
"
"
Still learning how to use it for best results but I really love the brand and have used other products by this company for years  Very happy.
"
"
wonderful product the gel is a medium hold so their is not much of a cast to brake
"
"
Damage product leaking
"
"
I've been using this product on my hair for the past 2 years.  The delivery this time was particularly speedy - which I sincerely appreciate because I don't use anything else except my WEN Fig Cleansing Conditioner. :)I'll definitely reorder in the future.
"
"
Love this gel, great product for curly hair
"
"
This gel is great. And it works really well with curly hair. Anyone with curly hair really needs this in their bathroom.
"
"
Love the product but when received gel cap was not tight and leaked all over. Need product no time to return. Lost a good amount.
"
"
BAD
"
"
This product is poor quality and likely a fake. It is very watery.
"
"
Love the product. Maybe next time you’ll package it better so it doesn’t break open considering it’s not a cheap product.
"
"
Not quite as good as Aveena (sp?) for defining curls but it will do for the money..More economical and smells great!
"
"
Not a good gel for type 4 Hair!
"
"
THE best for curly hair. Not sticky. Produces a very natural curl.I use all the Deva products and they are the best!
"
"
Works well.
"
"
switched from other products years ago. sets hair without leaving a sticky stiff or flaky feeling behind. once dry,i toussel my hair for the relaxed look and it holds its shape
"
"
this product is one of Devachan's best-especially for curly hair. It doesn't dry out the hair the way that other gels do.The product was also packaged very nicely so that there was no spill and the pump worked like a charm to the last drop.because of the great quality of the product and packaging method I am giving this 5 stars
"
"
Best gel out there for curly tendrils!
"
"
The Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel works great on my hair.  Good hold, not crunchy. Would buy again.
"
"
This is the best gel for curly hair.  It is lightweight and leaves your hair soft and curly without weighing it down or looking wet.
"
"
Great curl defining without being sticky and leaving my hear stiff.
"
"
This smells so good and I get complements all the time about how good my hair smells whenever I use this. This is the only gel I will use on my long, naturally wavy hair and it does not leave my hair feeling crunchy.  I also love that it is paraben and sulfite free product.
"
"
Fake product! Do not buy!
"
"
excellent product, the best gel for curly hair
"
"
Broken dispenser
"
"
I have had curly curly curls for a very long time...and I love this gel. It works Every time to tame the curls and make me love love love having curly curls!
"
"
The box was torn and the pump was broken! I'm so disappointed!
"
"
LOVE this product - wouldn't go out of the house without it! Buying on Amazon is much cheaper than the salon stores
"
"
My hair stylist introduced me to the Deva product line for my curly hair.  When she recommended Arc Angel and used it on my hair it held without the stiffness of the other over the counter one I was using.I recommend this product highly.
"
"
I was extremely disappointed. It arrived as a liquid rather than a gel. I have been waiting for months to obtain this product only to have it arrive in poor quality. I had it carried to South America so there was no way to return it.
"
"
I have mostly straight, slightly, randomly wavy hair and just a quarter-size drop of this after my shower gives me perfect beach-waves, with ZERO crunch!  Smells great, feels great, looks AMAZING!
"
"
The pump was broken when it arrived.
"
"
Very very happy with this product.  I use this with Sunsilk Hydra TLC and my hair is very soft and manageable, even on rainy days.
"
"
I HAVE VERY GOOD LUCK WITH THIS PRODUCET IN GETTING MY HAIR TO DO WHAT I WANT IT TO DO,.
"
"
Not sure why this product is so drying but I won't buy this again.
"
"
Great stuff
"
"
Not a fan of eiva curl. I like ouidad better.
"
"
This is the first product that I have used with my curly hair that does not get my hair frizzy!  It really works - even in humid weather.
"
"
My curls love this product. After it air drys I break the cast and done ♥️
"
"
Just what I expected.
"
"
My two daughters' have super curly hair. They are white and African American.  This product was wonderful for their curls.  It made them shiny and by using the Deva No-poo and conditioner also, their hair was amazingly manageable and hydrated.
"
"
Love this.  Keeps my curls without being sticky.
"
"
I'd been using Deva's Light Defining Gel when a friend recommended Arc Angel. I really prefer Arc Angel now. Although they both have a similar consistency when I put them in my hair, the Arc Angel product just seems to define my curls better without making them crunchy. Great stuff!
"
"
Made my hair crunchy.
"
"
Best product on the market for curly hair
"
"
Very fresh product and sells for much less than you can buy directly from devacurl.com.  I was very happy with my purchase!
"
"
Love the ingredients, but it did not support my curls well.
"
"
Product smells so good and does everything it states it will do! So long as you follow the directions and let your hair dry without touching it, my hair has never looked more frizz-free or healthier. My curls are much more defined and soft to the touch...ONLY thing, you should probably use a leave in creme or conditioner if your hair is naturally dry. Definitely worth it!
"
"
I like. Beautiful
"
"
Love the product it does it's job, the only thing is that it makes your hair sticky, tacky feeling.  Wish I would of heard of this product line long time ago.  My hair looks great.
"
"
works well for curly hair, follow directions and it will keep frizz down, dos'nt leave hair feeling stiff. My granddaughter & daughter-in-law love it.
"
"
Fast service!  Great product!
"
"
if you have curly hair deva products are a must.  been using for 6 years and still get compliments on my curly hair
"
"
A little bit goes a long way, it holds my curls while it combats frizz all day-my curls can't live without it!
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
As a curly girl, I have done my fair share of experimenting with products. This gel has effective hold, does not add crunchiness to hair, and is lightweight. I have been using it for over 6 months.
"
"
I've alternated back & forth between this gel and the Ultra Defining Gel, and at first when I used this it was way too strong and seemed to way my hair down; HOWEVER, when I recently had a Deva Cut, I tried it again & used a diffuser and it worked way better. My main problem is I have ""Botticelli"" type curls and when my hair gets too long it just goes limp and I wasn't applying it right. I found the best way to use this is too smooth it onto my hair & then scrunch it & then when dry to use a little Argan/Moroccan oil to break the cast. The only thing I will say negative about this is that if your using set it free spray or Mister right it will make your hair wicked sticky so beware, otherwise it's a really great gel with a good hold
"
"
After tryng it all (paul mitchel, tigi, moroccan oil, volumax, matrix, fructis, pantene, etc...) I settled with a combination of ouidad climate control gel and deva curl ultra defining gel 50:50 mix and it worked well with my hair which has tight curls.  I keep searching for new products, specially for not having to mix two expensive gels to get the effect I need.  This gel gets the job done.  It provides definition with a little bit of stiffness which is just the right amount.  I love it.  I have even had 3rd day defined curls and I cannot achieve that with any other product. Excellent product.  It works well when applied in very wet hair
"
"
I love this brand and especially this gel.  My husband and I both use it, for his super-straight black hair and my curvier grey.  If our hair gets smooshed down by hats during the winter, running wet hands through brings it back to life!
"
"
This hair gel is the best I've used.  It is lightweight once it dries - you just have to shake the curls out a little bit and you have smooth curls all day without being too crunchy.  Great product!
"
"
Very Satisfied
"
"
I loved this product. I have used it and will continue to use it.  It doesn't make your hair to stiff, but when you put it on wet hair per the directions, your curls set very very well without drying out or feeling too crunchy.  I will be using this product regularly.  I am very pleased.  A little goes a long way!!!
"
"
Anyone who has curly hair should truly be using this product. Love the Deva Curl line. Will definitely continue using.
"
"
This holds better than the regular angel gel yet doesn't feel stiff. I've switched to only using the firm hold.
"
"
Love it.
"
"
can't leave home without it!
"
"
Awesome product
"
"
Excellent hold
"
"
Mixed with ""heaven in hair"" this puts just the right amount of hold into my kinky/curly hair to control the friz without adding stiffness.  Great stuff.  Be careful to just use a little bit though.--half dollar size for longer hair.

"
I've got the curly hair that's rather difficult to tame.  This gel smells great, doesn't leave hair feeling sticky and tames wild curls.
"
"
I love this product-have used it for years-but first time from this buyer. Shipping was fast and the product was great!!!
"
"
Great product for my curly hair...iit leaves my hair firm but not sticky ...i used it for years and will continue using it
"
"
Sulfate and silicone free. Perfect for curly hair. It has a firm hold that will carry over for a second day if desired.  No lingering scent. Washes out of the hair almost completely with only water.  I use No-poo in the shower but sometimes I don't think I need it because I use this gel.
"
"
leaves my hair soft and touchable unlike other gels.  even feels good the next day. will definately keep using this product.
"
"
I love this product. I have learned to embrace and show off my curls now.
"
"
love it so much and great for when it is humid
"
"
Bottle lid was damaged and gel was spilled everywhere when I opened the package.  Came in a box with 2 other items that were fine ~ so not sure what happened there?  Love the product though.
"
"
If you have curly hair, Deva products are the products to use.  My curls dry frizz free for the first time.  Love, love, love!
"
"
Love this product. After receiving this from this seller, I am convinced that my previous purchase from a different seller was diluted. This one was clearly a much thicker product and worked well. Love using this in my daughter's hair. Leaves her curls defined without being crunchy, wet, or sticky. the hold last all day and she no longer has frizzy hair but the end of the day. Highly recommended. Thank you!
"
"
My teenage daughter has extremely curly hair and has much healthier looking and feeling hair since using DevaCurl products. Highly recommend trying it.
"
"
Keep my curls.
"
"
Not as much hold as the Ultra defining gel. Think I'll go back to it.
"
"
I love this product
"
"
My favorite gel. Not to heavy but holds well.
"
"
DevaCurl angel is the best product that I have found for my curly hair..and I have tried many items.  I love the whole line of this product because it defines my curls so my hair is not frizzy the curls are bouncy and shiny.
"
"
Formula seems different, unpleasant texture to my hair and curls not as defined as with prior use
"
"
I have been using Arc Angel since 2007. It has a great aroma, ingredients, hold, and price. Can't imagine a better gel. I purchase it once a year online for cheaper than the Deva Store in manhattan and it lasts me the entire year.
"
"
I have used Curlisto and some other high end curl products but nothing gives me soft, magical curls like this gel.  A must for curly girls.
"
"
I love this gel. It works better than any other product I've tried. My curls are soft and defined with no frizz.
"
"
I have been using this gel for years and it ain't cheap!  Thank goodness Amazon offers the deals the deals that they do so I can get more of them at a time & at a better price. This gel is great since it doesn't dry out my hair, leave it crunchy & it smells awesome to boot.
"
"
Squeezing the gel through my wet tresses as my head hung in front of my belly button, I stole a sideways glance into my full length mirror with high hopes for smooth curls.  Wet and gelled they looked perfect and I anticipated lovely, lilting locks when they dried.  Nope, I had a halo of frizz.  Tried it again a the next day and used more product.  Still frizz.  This is not miracle gel.  I got similar-to-better results from a product I bought at the local drug store for half the price.
"
"
This product is not sticky and doesn't leave my hair crunchy. I feel it's worth the money to purchase the big bottle since I use this product daily.
"
"
Love this stuff been using it for a year and it so much cheaper through Amazon my hair has so much curl love that if I get low I know where to go thanks
"
"
I don't know why but it doesn't work as well as the one the hair salon is using. It's strange
"
"
I've been using Deva products for a little over a year and love them. The gel holds my curls and are no longer ""crunchy"". I also use curly hair solutions in conjunction with the Deva gel to help with frizz. Wouldn't go back to ""regular"" products.
"
"
I have been trying many generic and other brand gel, that claim to be alcohol free, but this one is far my favorite and best product. It really brings out my curls after it has dried up and doesn't make it flaky.
"
"
This is the best product I have ever tried, and to get it at such a great price is a super bonus!
"
"
Can't beat the price!
"
"
Awesome product, wish I would have found this years ago!! It holds without being sticky or stiff. Makes curls super bouncy!
"
"
This is the only gel I use on my natural curls!
"
"
I've found my magic hair solution in Devacurls Arc angel Firm Hold defining Gel!
"
"
Absolutely LOVE Arc Angel, but the pump stopped working shortly after purchase making it a real chore to use. Wish they provided caps as an alternative to the pump.
"
"
The only gel that works for my hair without leaving it crunchy and sticky. I always recommend DevaChan to my friends with curly hair.
"
"
Deva is great for curly hair. I use many of their products and especially like Arc Angel Gel. I am constantly asked which products I use on my hair, and I always recommend Deva!
"
"
Overall, I thought this gel was pretty good. It didnt make my hair frizzy; but I dont think its worth the money.
"
"
love this stuff!
"
"
Works better than anything I've tried so far to keep my curl separated and frizz free. Highly recommend.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Best product I've ever used for naturally curly hair!  Shampoo & conditioner are AWESOME, too!
"
"
It is wonderful on ""naturally curly"" hair. I love this stuff - brings my curls back to life!!!!I will keep buying this product yearly!!!
"
"
I have used this product for almost a year and I love it! I have curly hair and it helps make my curls defined and not frizzy.
"
"
This gel works really well for my hair. It gives me beautiful spiral curls, the only downside is that sometimes by the end of the say I do have a few white flakes in my hair dor this product. I simply wet my hands and run them over my hair to rehydrate the product and scrunch up my curls.
"
"
This is the only product that will not ""crust"" my hair. It provides hold but also mobility which is perfect for my hair.
"
"
To all who have curly hair please try this product with works very well and last all day long yahoo
"
"
Awesome product. Great service!!
"
"
Holds curl with out making hair all crunchy.
"
"
This is a great product and it smells incredible. It doesn't make my hair feel sticky or weighed down. I love it!
"
"
perfect for curly hair. never stiff and works well for touch ups. best product on the market for curly hair.
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
Great product!!!
"
"
No flaky residue
"
"
As expected -  Great product
"
"
was so excited to get this product!!!!  Tried 3xs to use it followed instructions, didnt mess with it until dry etc.  However it dried my hair out so much!!!!  But then again, my hair gets really frizzy @ times. My hair is long past bra strap when dry. I have  the brazilian blowout on my hair so currently my curls are 3a-b with frizz.  Usually 3b-c Im caucasion.
"
"
Absolutely love this product.
"
"
Works like no other!
"
"
We have three naturally curly hair (dry, frizzy hair) girls in the family and we all love this gel.  It gives great curl shape while keeping the hair soft (no crunchy feel if you ""break the cast"" as suggested in the Curly Girl Handbook - we highly recommend the book if you have curly hair).
"
"
At last I found a great hair gel!  Its not sticky or smelly and holds my wavy hair just enough.  Make sure you only use a tiny bit or you will end up with a mess in your hair
"
"
My wife bought this product and she is writing this review.I LOVE this product.  This gel holds my curls just as advertised on the side of the bottle.  I highly recommend to any ""curly girl"" out there.
"
"
I love Deva Care arc angel gel! It works perfectly on my hair. I get many compliments not only on the look of my hair but also the smell. This has an orange creamsicle smell to it. I do not smell it in my hair after it has dried but still receive compliments about the smell. The size of this bottle is perfect - best buy- and love the pump!
"
"
This stuff holds pretty well without feeling crunchy or building up. It could hold a little better, but is a definite improvement over the Ultra Defining Gel.
"
"
Smells great, and can handle the intense Houston humidity.  Extremely satisfiednand grateful 😁
"
"
It holds well and encourages curls.  After it drys, all you have to do is crunck you hair or run your hand through it and that ""firm finish"" goes away, but the hold still remains.
"
"
I really, really wanted to like this product, but I don't.  While my hair starts out looking nice, as the day goes on the frizz gets unbelievable!  It also seems to really dry out my hair.  Just not a good product for my curly girl hair....
"
"
Perfect product for curly hair.
"
"
Have used deva curl for years. Received a product that looked like arc angel but that was not what was inside! Plus pump was broken- do not buy from this buyer!
"
"
I a, a huge fan of Deva products and have used Arcangel before. I am convinced this is a watered down version of the real Devacurl product. Buyers beware!
"
"
I have curly hair and I have been addicted to deva curl! This gel is great no more crunchy hair:) Just follow the directions on the bottle.
"
"
I have uneven curly hair.  Deva Curl is great in balancing the curl. Plus the curldoesn't flop during the day
"
"
Amazing product and great shipping!
"
"
perfect
"
"
Having curly hair means trying a store full of products. This is the BEST product for my tight, curly hair. It controls it without making it look ""wet"" or frizzy! I use a lot of it, so this size is perfect. It may be pricey, but let me tell you it is worth it. I use it on wet hair. It smells good too.
"
"
I love this product.  Perfect for my curly hair.
"
"
I like it a little to much at first !how do you use it?
"
"
i just dont like the way it feels
"
"
Love this gel!!!
"
"
I have been using Deva products purchased at my salon for years and I love it! This is NOT it. Spend the extra few bucks and buy it from an authorized vendor. This is essentially a 32 oz scented bottle of thickened water. SO FAKE!!
"
"
I initially trialed the Deva Care line at my local Ulta.  I absolutely fell in love with it.  Purchasing on Amazon has always been way more cost effective.  When I received the gel from Amazon it seemed watered down.  Didn't think anything of it but I was using more.  I then purchased the same product from Ulta again and compared.  It was a completely different color and much thicker.  I am pretty sure the one I purchased from Amazon was fake.  Buyer beware
"
"
Got it in a timely fashion.
"
"
I thought this wasn't too bad of a product until I used Jane Carter Solutions Curl Defining Cream. I realized how sticky my hair was compared to the CDC. I don't think I would buy it again. I am sold on Jane Carter.
"
"
I hated my curly hair when I was younger (who didn't?) but now that I am an adult I have learned to love and embrace what nature gave me. This Gel has transformed my mane!  Before my stylist introduced me to the DevaCurl line, I felt I had two choices: Frizzy hair or hard hair from products claiming to be ""for curly hair.""  The entire DevaCurl line is amazing, I recommend it to anyone with curly hair!The photo of the item showed the pump.  The bottle did NOT come with a pump, just a regular gel-bottle top.  This is disappointing because I specifically ordered from this post because it showed the pump and others did not.
"
"
I didn't buy this product from Amazon, I bought from an authorized retailer.DevaCurl is consistently un-impressive to me. I am mixed race with 2c / 3a, medium thickness, normal porosity hair, which is healthy but needs a lot of moisture. This expensive gel is not terrible, but nothing special. It has a lot of hold, but it made my hair more dry and dull, even when combined with leave-in conditioner or cream. It did not help to enhance or define my curls any better than many cheaper products. I usually like to re-wet and detangle my hair in between wash days, and I think this gel makes my hair a lot more tangled and stuck together. Basically it gives me the same results as using a bunch of hair spray.The DevaCurl Ultra Defining gel works better for me, but it's still not amazing for the price. The light defining gel is totally worthless.These products might work for you but if you're thinking of trying them, please don't believe all the hype that they are great for everyone. Try before you buy if you can. Or stick with Shea Moisture, Cantu, Ouidad, Ecoco etc. at the grocery store for 1/2 or 1/3 the price.
"
"
I did my first wash and go with this product on New Year’s Eve and now I’m sad because I’m completely HOOKED!! It worked so well with my hair (3B 3C hair) I used Cantu curl activator first in sections, then I applied this Deva curl gel in section (drenched hair). And I absolutely love it!! It smells so good & lasted a long time with no hard crunch. This gel did not fake & my curls lasted a couple days. I’m sure it would’ve lasted longer if I would’ve put it up in a pineapple at night but forgot to. The ONLY downside is the price! My pockets hate to pay for this, hopefully this seller continues to sell it at this price and not continually increase the price.
"
"
I have been using Arc Angel for 6 years and LOVE IT because it's perfect for my curls. You'll find reviews here that say it's not good but it's really about what works for your type of curls. Just like the Goldilocks story (different beds are for different bears :) you have to figure out which DevaCurl gel is perfect for your curls. For me, the Ultra Defining Gel was too hard and the Angel, or light defining gel, was too soft and my curls were gone the next day. Arc Angel is just right for me. And I never have a problem with crunchy hair. After it's dry I scrunch it to break the cast. If you are having problems it might be due to the product being old - that's what my world class stylist and DevaCurl Master says.
"
"
I've tried so many brands and formulations of hair gels I couldn't remember them if I tried.  DevaCare Arc Angel is different from any ordinary hair gels.  I apply ArcAngel to soaking wet hair, and either air dry, plop, or diffuse.  That's it.  My hair turns out beautifully and my curls last. For second day or third day hair, Arc Angel is easily reactivated with DevaCurl Set It Free or Mist-er Right, and my hair looks freshly styled. Occasionally I try other curl gels or creams, but I always wind up rinsing them out and applying Arc Angel.  My hair just likes it best.  It gives me definition, hold, shine, and moisturization.  Even if dew points are extremely low, this keeps dryness and frizz at bay! The best part about this gel is it never gets crunchy or crispy.  It solidifies, creating a a pliable gel coating that doesn't flake or crack. It ""scrunches out""  extremely easily without causing frizz. I enjoy its mild, citrus scent, too. Arc Angel is a must have for me to feel like my hair looks its best.
"
"
Couldn't wait to try this. Glad I got it half price at a beauty supply store, thanks to my son's cosmetologist girlfriend. I bought this with the curl cream. They smell great, but provide zero hold for my 3a to 3B curls. I'll use it when I wear my hair up for work, but for loose styles, I'll stick with my LA looks sport gel for the hold.
"
"
Product came damaged. Needs to be packed better from the start. Sent it back. :(
"
"
My new devacut stylist used this today and i loved it and ordered it right away! I've been using Ouidad's Tress Effects for over 15 yrs, which I also love! But....so happy to finally find this more cost effective alternative.
"
"
DevaCurl saved my life! I always say I'm on a life-long journey for good hair products! I can finally stop looking! My hair is so shiny and healthy and this product doesn't leave my hands sticky! I apply it while my hair is dripping wet and then scrunch my hair with an old tshirt. I've always had to use 3-4 products on my hair at one time but with this I just add a little natural oil after it's dry. I have extremely long hair and surprisingly I didn't have to use half of the bottle on one do! I can't wait to try more products from this line!
"
"
AFTER YEARS OF TRYING CHEAP TO EXPENSIVE GEL, LEAVE IN CONDITIONER, MOUSSE.. YOU NAME IT... THIS WORKS BEAUTIFUL ON MY CURLS.. NO MORE FRIZZ BALL!!  I USE THE NO POO AND THE ONE CONDITIONER.. I LEAVE SOME OF THE CONDITIONER ON AND MIX IT WITH THE ANGELL.. LET IT DRY ... CRUNCH AND VIO'LA !! BEAUTIFUL HEALTHY CURLS ... NO MORE FIZZ.... MY ANGEL FOR SURE!!
"
"
LOVE IT!!  Just what I hoped it would be.  DevaCurl is the best for thick, curly hair like mine.  It helps to define and tame my long curls.  Will be ordering again..
"
"
Curly hair is gorgeous when styled correctly, a hot mess when no one shows  you how to manage it. Drug store brands leave you flat, crunchy and sticky, and expensive brands leave you disappointed as well. DevaCurl Arc Angel is EXTRAORDINARY! Flip your head, put in as much as you like, squeeze with a paper towel and either air dry or use a diffuser with your head upside down, and voila! Gorgeous, bouncy, defined curls.THANK YOU ARC ANGEL!(Tip: it never gets crunchy because it's all natural. I have long hair so I use more. For the paper towel part, I stack 2 and re-use 2 or 3 times before tossing. I keep a paper towel roll under the sink to keep things simple. I also keep a few paper towel sheets in my luggage for travel.)
"
"
I've been using deva products for over 10 years and I love it. But this gel stays hard when your hair is dry. I use it when I pull my hair back or wear it up and want it to hold but not when I wear my hair down.
"
"
I started using DevaCurl products a few months ago, and my hair has never looked better.  After I wash, condition, and comb my hair with a wide-tooth comb, I use a cotton t-shirt to remove excess moisture.  Then I flip my hair over (upside-down) and apply Arc Angel, scrunching it from ends to roots.  It takes a small amount, as this is a firm-hold gel.  Then, I plop my hair.  (You can look up videos to show you how to do this.  It's a way to wrap your hair and let it dry without stretching out your curl.)  When I take it down, I have thick strands of beautiful curls that hold their shape all day.  The best part is that it doesn't leave your hair stiff and sticky, and like all DevaCurl products, it smells great!
"
"
The item came and was exactly as described.  It was shipped in a timely manner.  I saved $10 by buying my hairspray and gel through Amazon rather than using my local salon to purchase.  With my Amazon prime account, I don't pay shipping so win, win.
"
"
I chose to use the ArcAngell over Angell due to the porosity of my hair. ArcAngell provides my hair with additional moisture while still helping to maintain my curl. Unlike drug store hair gels intended for curly hair, I do not end up with crinkle curls or hard like glue curls. My hair is not sticky or gross after using this product.
"
"
Finally I found a product that really works My curls are more defined and  shinny ...not frizzy anymore  :)
"
"
I have used the light hold Deva gel and it was fine for part of my hair but my right side curls are stubborn and more frizzy than anywhere else on my head (!) so I bought this firm hold gel, used it on my stubborn side and got much better results.  No crunch, good curl definition and lots of shine.  Love the Deva Care products.  After 53 years, I'm finally liking my curls; what a relief!
"
"
This gel is intended for curly hair, and holds extremely well.  Designed for those who scrunch their curls and air dry their hair, it also works very well with a hair dryer and diffuser.
"
"
Once again the product is great, wife loves it. Otheer review got censsored.  watch out for 2 day sh?pping taking 6 days with amazam promo otherwise 8.99 for 2 daze sh?pping???
"
"
This is the best gel for curly hair out there! Trust me! I am a curly hair stylist and have tried A LOT! This leaves your hair soft, controlled and with no frizz! Works great with Deva Curl Set it Free also! See a curly hair specialist to get more tips on using! [...]

I have very thick African American hair, mostly a mix of 3a-4a curls. I've had this gel for over two months now, so I'm going to give the results of my experiements.The included image is of my hair only minutes after washing it. In my hair I have a diluted mix of DevaCurl One Condition Decadence, Mist-er Right, Supercream and Arc Angel gel. The makn ingredient that is causing my hair to clump is the gel, which I typically use right after washing to avoid shrunken-up, frizzy hair, to replenish moisture, and add shine.In my opinion, this product works best to define your own natural curl pattern, as opposed being used to help set a twist-out- bantu knot-out, braid-out, ect. It is very thick and has an amazing citrus scent, which I love. A lot of Black naturals aren't used to the concept of sparringly anymore because our hair is so thick, but when I say use this sparringly I mean sparringly! You only need a small, finger-tip sized amount per section. This product cannot be used interchangably like eco-styler gel where you just plop on as much as possible. It works best with other stylers, especially with DevaCurl Supercream.The majority of the problems I see when Black women are using DevaCurl products is that they are attempting to use them individually as opposed to with several other DevaCurl products because the products are expensive and they don't want to shell out all that money. This is a huge mistake that will no doubt leave you disappointed.In order to achieve perfect, long-lasting, frizz free definition with DevaCurl products on thick, natural Afro-textured hair YOU HAVE TO USE SEVERAL DEVA CURL PRODUCTS AT ONCE.Here is my DevaCurl routine. I use it to define my own natural curls and for twst outs but mostly bantu knots, so here it is:1. Moisten a small to medium section of hair with One Condition Decadence diluted with water. This adds moisture and deifnion. We're going to layer the products until we recieve the definition and moisture we want.1. Spritz with Mist-er Right. This spray really adds moisure you can feel and helps my curls spring and pop.2. Take a fingertip sized amount of SuperCream and add two to three drops of MirrorCurls. The MirrorCurls really adds fantastic, glossy shine without leaving my hair feeling greasy or oily. I love shiny, glossy hair so this leaves me feeling satisfied. Keep in mind that this product has both the scent and texture of castor oil which many other reviewers have found  unpleasant.3. Add a fingertip sized amount of ArcAngel Gel. This adds both slip and a touch of hold. I much prefer the Beautiful Mess pomade for hold, but I like to layer the two. For some reason the Beautiful Mess pomade seems to ""melt"" or ""dissolve"" upon contact with soaking wet hair, making it fairly useless when styling straight out of the shower.4. Add a fingertipped sized amount of Beautiful Mess pomade. This is my holy grail product. It shapes and molds my curls with no crunch, no flakes, no white residue, and no stiffness. The reult is always perfect, glossy curls with frizz-free definition that seperate like butter.5. Allow your hair to dry for as long as possible. I do my hair early in the morning on my days off to ensure proper drying time.
"

I have been wanting to write a review for months because this product was a fake...or more likely the real thing but really watered down.  I have been using the arc angel gel for many years and this one was a MUCH more liquidy consistency.  I mixed it with the new Deva Ultra Defining gel which I'd recently bought from a salon and had found too thick and that seemed to do the trick.  But now that i've finished the bottle I won't ever buy it again on Amazon or at least not from the seller ""The Best Deals in the USA""
"
"
When i first started my curly hair journey, this gel was great for me. I used it for 2 years. But as my hair got healthier and more curI, i began to notice it was actually weighing down my 2c curls. But the ultra defining gel wasnt enough hold.. And that also felt heavy! I  so I tried Kinky Curly Curling Custard, a few shea moisture gel creams, and noticed in comparison my hair felt light and my curls had way more body. Kept their shape too! The deva gels arent bad but through trying other products ive learned it is definitely not the best curl sculpting product out there.  Also not a good choice for humid days. Ive seen that true for multiple curl types!!
"
"
I have been a loyal Deva Curl client for five years! I loved their products, techniques, and even get the DevaCut. I used to love how my hair looked and felt with the products. Even when the change of ownership came and their products started to get marked up, I figured it’s still worth it. Then, for the past few months especially, I’ve noticed changes in my hair and scalp. I had been using the same products for years, no-poo shampoo, one condition, styling cream, believe-in, and ultra defining gel or the arc-angel gel. However, my scalp became itchier and itchier, dryer and dryer, and now I have dandruff I can’t get rid of. What’s worse, is my hair! It became dryer and coarser. The worse it got the more products I used and the more I washed it. I tried different techniques and brushing it differently. Always slept with a silk pillowcase AND silk bonnet. Then I figured I should get DevaCurl’s Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask. It just made things worse. My hair shed to new extremes, making my hair look flat and thin, my scalp got worse with dry patches that felt tight and hard. My hair was so dry and coarse even after washing my hair, at the end of the day it was matted. Keep in mind I have 3A/B curls, it takes quite a bit to have it matted. not tangled, MATTED. Which of corse meant I had to wash it more, and brushing through it made it fall out more! My curls werent taking shape like they used to. My curls looked more like matted, dry, haystacks that slightly waved. My scalp became sensitive to brushing, it was a nightmare! I stopped using DevaCurl in just a week and I’ve noticed a huge difference already. My curls haven’t fully recovered, but I’m hopeful they will. I will not buy DevaCurl again unless they address this and change to fix the issue. So disappointed, five years of spending money one overpriced products and this is how they repay me. I honestly just want them to go back to how they used to be.
"
"
I did not like this gel at all and since it was my 1st time using it, I thought I should try a different gel.  I ordered the Light Defining gel directly from the manufacturer and received a sample of the Arc Angel gel.  I decided to try it on a day I would be spending outside in heat and humidity. The sample was an orangish color & worked amazing whereas the product purchases her was clear and worked like a cheap dollar store gel.  So tired of fake products on Amazon. Don't buy this product here,  it's fake.
"
"
 I have used a huge number of gels and hair products for curly hair. I was going. To order another bottle of ouidad and saw reviews for this arc angel gel. So I ordered two 32 oz bottles just Incase I like it. Well it controls my curly hair. I use three pumps for my hair and that’s more than enough. And it should last me quit awhile. The scent is fresh and for a guy works great with my echo  Cologne.So tried more pumps 4-5 now and works even better.
"
"
I LOVE DevaCurl! These products have changed my life. I feel so much more confident and myself now that I have help styling and maintaining my curls. I discovered Deva almost a decade ago and rarely use any other product. When I have, I immediately notice the difference. No other gel I have tried is quite like Deva - which NEVER leaves my hair crunchy or greasy. I recommend Deva to every curly girl who has ever complimented my hair - from close family to complete strangers. The Arc Angel is a stronger hold; if you have wavy hair, try the light hold.Amazon often has lower prices than I can get at local beauty stores but I have occasionally had the bottles leak a bit on shipping.
"
"
I am not sure if what I purchased was a fake (the smell was righ but the color was off)) or if it was perhaps expired, all I know is this product did not work the way I have found it to when I have purchased it from Ulta or Sephora.  Normally I can scrunch this in leave my hair to air dry and then break the ""cast"" and have the softest most durable curls that last till my next shampooing. This left my hair oily and lifeless and not at all nice to touch. Highly recommend that you save the $$ and buy it from a licensed salon or distributor.
"
"
In my opinion, this is either not the real product or it’s watered down. I compared it to my current product, purchased at Ulta. It smells the same and has pretty much the same consistency. However, the “stickiness” is totally off. Therefore, the way it holds my curls doesn’t work even close to what I purchased at Ulta. It does work just not even close to as well as the product I purchased at Ulta. If you’re not familiar with the original product, you may like it. But, seriously, what I purchased at Ulta is 100% better. As far as I’m concerned, even though it’s cheaper, it’s not a good buy.
"
"
I'm not even sure if this gel came from Devacurl.  I have their other products and this was totally different.  first off it watery. non of their gels are like that.  It is similar to the cheap stuff from walmart like LA looks or something. it makes your hands feel gross when you go to scrunch your dry hair, DEF not a a devacurl thing. doesnt hold and arcangel is the strongest gel in the line, over this is trash DO NOT BUY. BUY devaCURL arc angel NOT devaCARE
"
"
This was my first time buying deva curl products. Someone told me they have a lot of protein, not sure how true that is. I have low porosity 3C hair and this was a little drying for my hair. I wouldnt spend this much money again, I bought some samples of the supercream and Im going to mix them together and see how my wash n go comes out after that. So far though, I've tried 3 deva curl products and im not really impressed, especially since theyre expensive. wont be repurchasing, because it doesnt give me the moisture and hold that I need, though it does do a great job with definition like all of their other products, I will however finish the bottle.

This product has an absurd amount of water in it. I was very hopeful about this gel, as it was recommended by others... however, you're paying a silly amount of money for a liter of water. I suppose if you put this in a bottle and diluted 1:1 it might be alright to spray in, if your hair is okay with being sprayed. But, otherwise, this is just a fair waste of money.
"
"
I've read the reviews that said it wasn't. I've read a lot of bad reviews about great things. I received ArcAngel. It smells the same, it feels the same, it works the same. All soft and not drying. I can manipulate control after air drying the same. Maybe certain people aren't getting the real thing but I did. The same goes for the One Condition, No Poo, and SuperCream I ordered. All perfect Deva products 💗💗💗

"
This stuff works. I admit I was skeptical, but I am sold. it does not flake after my hair is dry and the hold is firm but not stiff. i use this when I am wearing my hair curly and also when i am wearing it straight to keep it straight. I have lots of compliments on the smell. It washes out very easily with water. You only need to use a small amount so this bottle will last for a long time and it well worth the price.
"
"
The scent is nice but I have to use twice as much to get the same affect as the Ultra Defining gel.  My hair is frizzy and the curls aren’t very well defined using this gel.  I’ve been using DevaCurl for years and only bought the Arc Angel because the Ultra Defining wasn’t available.  I won’t buy this again even if it means switching to another brand.

For almost 10 years I used Graham Webb Making Waves Curl Defining Gel and it was amazing. The company no longer exists so I had to find a new gel. It was so hard to find something to replace what I loved for so long!After trying countless gels from the store, I tried this one based on reviews. I am not sure it's 100% as good as what I used before, but it's good enough!This is my routine and it works great for me: In the shower, I scrunch my hair a couple times with my hands to get most of the water out and put a towel over my hair to dry my hair more. After a couple minutes, I take my towel off and apply gel to my hair upside down. I then scrunch my hair with a dry piece of a paper towel. I then repeat and add more gel, dry with another dry paper towel and do it one more time. After that, I spray my hair with KMS Curl Up Spray.I have found that this gel works great at getting those spirally curls and does not leave your hair looking stiff or crunchy.Definitely recommend!
"
"
I tried liking this stuff. I really wanted to. After reading reviews I thought I'd try. I have thick curly hair but this stuff just adds too much texture. It controls frizz wonderfully but my hair tangles so easily when using this product. Then when I go to wash and condition it just feels like straw. I'm not a fan. LUS works so much better for my hair.
"
"
I've used this product for years and loved and ordered it from this dealer several times. The dealer is always on time and I've never had a problem with them. The product on the other hand use to be amazing and I swore by it. I believe they have changed their formula because no matter where I buy this, it dries and damages my hair. This makes my hair hard to manage. I do not recommend this product.
"
"
The best product I’ve used so far.  I have had more compliments on my hair since switching to this Arc Angel gel then ever in my life.  Several people have bought it because they liked my hair so much.  Complete strangers will come up to me.  In my opinion it is the perfect balance of crunch and softness to my curls.
"
"
Weird, watery, didn't feel like the real deal at all, though it does smell like it. When you get real deva curl product, as I have in the past, IT WORKS. This does not.  First time I used a regular amount. Curls were puffy and not defined at all.  Second time I really slathered it on and it just left my hair, dull, feeling coated in too much product but not shiny, or smooth and my curls were frizzy once they dried. A 32oz bottle for $25 sounds too good to be true because it is. I will be returning this fake bull-crap right away. Thanks for nothing, Amazon.
"
"
I bought the No Poo, DevaCare One condition and the DevaCurl Deva Care Arc Angell. This line of product definitely makes my curls look gorgeous! They're more defined and my husband constantly tells me it looks sexy haha I get compliments from people often! My only gripe is that I believed all frizz would be eliminated but I still have quite a bit of frizz. I use the right type of dryer too (which I don't use every single time). I'm hoping the frizz is only happening because I've only been using this stuff for 2 1/2 weeks and I know it takes up to 6 weeks to see a total transformation. I'm a fan of the shampoo and gel smell but I do not like the smell of the conditioner. It reminds me of my grandma's Dove soap lol  All that aside, I will continue to purchase these hair products and I'll update my review after 6 weeks! :)
"
"
I've tried so many gels for my thick frizzy curls. I found these particular DevaCurl gel to work best for me. It still wasn't however enough to tame my wild fly-aways so I'm still dialing down which combo of product to keep my curls nice for many days before resuming another co-wash.
"
"
i didnt think this product would be any big deal, but I am amazed really. When you apply it , it is like it disappears into your hair, not slimy...nothing..in fact the first couple times i put on more because i just thought it wasnt enough! But, after a few uses I put on less and less and this just is wonderful on my hair. My hair is VERY fine and VERY curly (naturally) so the back tends to really kink up and even gets frizzy. I was so frustrated not being able to find anything. This defines the curls and does not gunk up my hair..fabulous!
"
"
This one in picture worked really well but when I ordered another it had different label and citrus smell not the jojoba one I liked. Disappointed with customer service on this. It does not work in my hair leaving it soft like the first one (pictured) won’t buy from this company again
"
"
This product doesn't really do the job. I have pretty fine, shoulder-length hair, and it's pretty curly (not too kinky/tight, but definitely more than wavy). I've been in a never-ending search for the right styling product ever since Graham Webb Making Waves gel was discontinued. Several of my curly-haired friends swear by Deva, so I tried this firm hold gel - my only reservation was that the firm hold might be too crunchy. And just the opposite occurred. It has ZERO hold and my hair is as frizzy as if it had no product in it. The feel was nice in my hand, and it smelled good, but it's just not doing the job.
"
"
This product is fake or at least past its date.  It doesn't work; doesn't create a cast in the slightest and reminded me of ""soft as jelly curls"" from Miss Jessie's rather than any of the DevaCurl gels.
"
"
No extra moisture at all. on the contrary, it dries my hair even more :(
"
"
I have 3c/4a natural hair. This product is a very lightweight gel that feels like water when you put it on your wet hair but has good hold. I combine with other curl cream products by DevaCurl and it keeps my hair defined for several days. Just a little spritz of water in the AM before work and a little scrunching and hair looks great! Just a small amount works wonders so this size should last for quite a while
"
"
I love this!!! This is the best gel I've used thus far eco styler was my number one then this stuff kicked it out of the ballpark no hard cast it's amazing on my 3c hair
"
"
Horrible product. I've been reading the other reviews, and maybe it's fake because it doesn't work as it is supposed.
"
"
I’m mixed and have multiple curl types and it held curls perfectly with miss Jessie’s leave in conditionerDefined and soft.Held for couple daysScent isn’t harsh and didn’t feel gross on my face.
"
"
very light gel with nice smell. this will not make your hair crunchy. Not sure what the best type of hair it works for. Mine is very thin and sometimes a heavier gel works better so my curls stay together instead of separating into a hundred of little curls.
"
"
I have been buying this hair gel for more than 10 years.  I use it every day and am very familiar with it.  Beware, though, and be sure you are getting what you are paying for!This particular order landed me with an obviously tampered with product.....the “gel” is so liquidy that it just ran through my fingers!  Like water!  Not cool.
"
"
I had high hopes for this product, however it left my hair dry dry dry and crunchy even with buckets of leave in conditioner. I do not recommend for 3c/4a hair.Not worth a penny.
"
"
Gel was very thick and sticky. Although it did a decent job of keeping frizz away it did not do much to control my hair style. I also found it difficult to apply it even because it was so thick. Even after i broke the “cast” my hair felt a little rough and dry. The product just wasnt for me. Curl Keeper works better for my curls (3b).
"
"
The gel works okay, but it doesn't form a hard cast. If you need more definition in your curls, this may not be for you.
"
"
If you have curly hair, these products are great. Between my Wen shampoo and this gel, that's all I use. I scrunch this in my hair while it's still wet and then once it's dry, I scrunch a bit more to soften it up. This is the firm hold and I would recommend it over the softer hold gels. But then, my hair is only wavy so I have to put some effort into getting curls. This also works well with a diffuser. It also worked well when I was in a very humid region recently -- no frizzies.
"
"
I bought this for my daughter who has very curly hair. Product works great; keeps her curls soft. She did not like the scent but I don't think it smells bad & it is light enough not to notice when hair dries.
"
"
The gel smells great, but feels more like shower gel than hair gel. The gel doesn’t hold anything. Once dried my hair is fluffy and without definition. Not my usual experience from devacurl. Price would be a good deal had it worked.
"
"
Really defined my curls but left them kinda crunchy at the roots even after I crunched it out after it dried. Maybe I applied too much product though. Really liked the results using the No Poo+One Condition+this product!
"
"
I was trying to figure out the scent and it dawned on me how it smells like a tanning salon lotion I used to use.  I LOVE it!!  I also love the fact that I get great curls without the frizz.
"
"
Works great and was the authentic product. I was nervous to buy this product from amazon b/c so many got fake or altered products. Rolled the dice after researching the seller. Turned out great!
"
"
The Arc Angel was not what I was expecting in a ""firm holding gel"". My hair was just as frizzy as if I used NO holding gel what-so-ever. I must simply stick to the Deva Curl Ultra defining gel (which is awesome & works as described with my curls). The seller was awesome though in understanding so I did receive a refund.Word of warning the Deva Curl and Deva Care are different so see what will work best with your hair.
"
"
This product did not work for my thin hair.  It just weighted it down and made it look thinner. It also made it feel heavy. Now having said this, my coworker has thick blond hair and it makes her straight hair curly. Works great for her.
"
"
So DevaCurl uses wheat in their gel. I know this because i recently found out i was allergic and checked all my products. This says it is wheat free so i continued to use it, despite my better judgement, but I'm still having a reaction. Not sure why they lied.
"
"
It arrived and cap was not secure, hence lost a good portion of the gel as it was all over the plastic wrap.  Can’t send back to get another one because I need it for a shoot.  Not happy!
"
"
I really wanted to love this product - but I hate it. it left my hair crunchier than Doritos and did absolutely NOTHING for my curls.
"
"
I purchased this product, because my hair reacts badly to one of the ingredients in the light hold gel (polyquaternium in case you're interested).  I was a fan of the watery consistency of the other gel, which this one also has.  I find it to be very easy to distribute throughout long, thick hair... only when wet of course.This gel definitely does enhance my curls.  It works well, but it's not my absolutel favorite, because it gives a bit of a dry feel to my hair.  Not that it actually dries my hair out (I'm not sure of that), but it feels dry to the touch.  Definitely worth trying to see if it works for you.
"
"
Great product to accentuate curls without weighing them down. My curly daughter can't live without it. And it smells awesome!
"
"
So I have 3b/c botticelli curls. Well, let me rephrase that, when I have product in my hair. Without product, due to years of abuse, I have cotton candy hair. I have tried hundreds of curly hair products - some super cheap, some pricey. I have found some that I like a LOT, but I think this is the first that I LOVE! It does everything I want. It gives amazing frizz free definition and leaves my hair super soft and bouncy. It gives me 2nd and probably 3rd day hair (I haven't tried 3rd day because I love clean hair). My hair even stood up to my 5 year old daughter ""playing"" with my hair (and she doesn't play nice). The smell is nice, though after the second day it sort of smells perfumey and gives me a bit of a headache. I use the no poo, then the conditioner in the shower and leave most of that in. Flip my head, add gel and scrunch with a paper towel, add a little more gel and scrunch. Then I add some clips for volume and let my hair air dry. Here is the problem with that; it takes my hair 2-4 hours to dry that way. I don't have time for that. I don't like using a diffuser because my hair doesn't dry as pretty and it has more frizz. Here is another BIG problem, (and it is possible I just don't know the right method/combination yet) I have to use a lot of the gel. I have used this bottle 3 times and it is 1/3 gone! I cannot afford to buy this stuff every 2-3 weeks! It truely does melt in my hair, but then I can't differentiate between the gel and water, so I use more. I tried using less today and I ended up using more than the other times because my hair seemed frizzy. Maybe I should try adding a second gel into my routine to stretch it farther, but that kind of defeats the purpose.  Another thing to mention- I was worried about using this as the videos directed. I usually wash my hair first in the shower and wash my body last. That way I don't get breakouts. I, so far, have not had a problem with the conditioner or gel causing a breakout. It does get on my body, and I am not crazy about that, but I try to just rinse it with water and it seems fine. I don't feel sticky or anything. Anyway, if you're on the fence about this product and you have the money, watch a video on youtube for the right method and give it a try. It really is fantastic!
"
"
This product is not for me.  My 2c, 3a curls looked weighed down and lifeless.  I also felt it was a bit frizzy at the crown.  I have tried other Deva products and have never been impressed.  I will always compare products to my favorite ""hair dope""  Ouidad Climate Control.
"
"
This gel is amazing! I love Deva curl! Just put on when hair is wet and either blow dry or let it dry and the curls are great and they hold all day!
"
"
I prefer the light defining gel.  I ordered this by mistake, thinking that I was ordering the light gel.  This product still works for me, in combination with the light gel.  It tends to weigh my hair down if I use it alone.  My hair is thin for curly hair, so I have had better results with the light gel.  I do love the DevaCurl line, however.  A lot of their products are amazing.
"
"
This is the number one product for curly hair!!!! Get it!!
"
"
This is a great product for my fine curly hair. Creates a great cast and lasting hold. I was extremely disappointed in the packaging from the seller as this arrived with gel all over.
"
"
This works great on my wavy hair and is Curly Girl method approved!
"
"
DevaCurl does it again with another wonderful product that makes your curls bouncy and defined.
"
"
I really live this gel. It holds curls all day.
"

First, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE VIDEOS (the 3-step) on their website and use the product exactly as described.  Yes, we all come in with our own habits and preferences, but to appreciate the product and learn how to use it, you have to really go in with an open mind.  OK? ---  It's like learning the rules of grammar before intentionally breaking them a la ee cummings.The following two tips from the videos have forever changed my hair:- NO MORE DRYING YOUR HAIR WITH A TOWEL.  Whether with this gel or any other, ever.- NO COMBING OR FINGER-COMBING ONCE YOU'VE RINSED OUT YOUR CONDITIONER.  None.  At this point, you are only scrunching out the water.So, with that in mind, this is a great gel.  I have wavy, not super curly hair, but I find I prefer this to the more flexible hold hair gel.  The other is, well, not quite enough for me.  This gives great definition and hold, without being sticky or otherwise crunchy.  For day 2, all I do is spritz plain old water with a little coconut oil and gently finger comb and re-scrunch.  Good to go!The gigantic bottle last me about 4 months and is worth every penny (hello! - that's less than $10 a month for the best gel ever!)
"
"
curls were defined but left my hair crunchy. The ""Curl cast"" doesn't go away like they advertise. Hair felt crispy and brittle. Smells good tho.
"
"
My curly hair is fine and thin.  Absolutely no body unless I put product in.  I've tried every kind of volumizing hair product there is, and ArcAngel is by far the best!  I actually get ""big"" hair when I use it!  I do use a root booster, too, though...usually Paul Mitchell.  I would love to be able to afford to use the whole line of DevaCare.  But this girl's splurge can only be the gel.
"
"
I love this gel .... not sticky on my hands for the most part.... my hair doesn't get all hard and look wet or greasy. It comes out beautiful every time . I've been using DevaCurl for a year now and only Deva .... I'm never going back haha . I can't recommend the products enough .
"
"
Fast and professional
"
"
I can't say enough good things about the Deva line of products.  Really - just read my other reviews and you'll get it.I love this gel.  Unlike other gels that seriously makes your hair feel like a package of spiral noodles (and then on windy days, you get wacked with them in the face??? OUCH!), this gel creates a cast.  So, initially, it is ""crunchy"" and wet looking.  But, once my hair fully dries (that's the trick - don't keep playing with it while it's still wet or damp), I scrunch it with my bare hands, it removes the 'cast' and I have soft, shiny (not wet looking), bouncy curls.  And, seriously soft.  I had a girl touch my hair yesterday because she didn't believe I put gel in it.I mix this with the Styling Cream.  It is perfect.  I use metal clips at the roots to give lift, the DevaFuser to dry it.  On days I am just hanging around home, I use the clips alone.  I leave them in to keep the roots lifted and when my hair is done air drying, I take the clips out, scrunch and it's still beautiful.The big bottle is perfect with the pump.  I travel a lot so I have the small Deva bottles to refill so this helps with that, but also, this lasts me over a year.  I actually purchased this bottle for my mom to use (who is now hooked on the Deva line once she saw all the compliments I got!) as my bottle is still half full.  I recommend this highly! It's the first gel that does what it says and doesn't give you crunchy hair (once you remove the cast).  And, some gels give this whitish, dusty, ashy look if you accidentally ""break"" the cast...not this.  This is a cast meant to be broken! :)
"
"
My hair was starting to lose some of its curls until my hairdresser introduced me to the DevaCurl line. I haven't had a bad hair day since I started using these products two years ago. They are all amazing, but the Arc Angel provides the best hold for my curls. My hair isn't wet looking or crunchy. It's just beautiful bouncy curls all day. A great product for sure!
"
"
It’s great for my curly hair
"
"
My favorite styling gel. Leaves my hair with so much volume and definition. I am natural with 3c/4a hair and I love this product. My wash and go's last 4 or more days
"
"
I absolutely love love love this gel will not use any other gel!!! Love devacurl!!!
"
"
I like that it keeps my waves in my fine hair and makes it look thicker and with more volume. Plus it has hardly any scent and I can still comb through my hair!
"
"
I used this on damp hair for a twist out and must say I am very pleased. Nay - ecstatic! I have been looking for a gel that would work on a wash and go as well as twist outs and braid outs without making my hair look stiff and dull. I used the smallest amount and have perfectly cork-screwed hair. It is shiny, full of body and bounce and there is not a flake in sight. I have other products in my hair and sometimes gels can react badly with creams, this does not.I did add the gel to damp hair on one section and let semi-dry to see how my curls would look with a wash and go and the gel elongated and defined my curls. I cannot say how long that would last, but will update my review as I try more styles. I purchased the 32 oz bottle and having very thick, tightly coiled 4a hair I know this was a good deal and will last me months. The scent is pleasant and not over powering and the results are amazing. Definitely worth a try if you want something versatile that will give great hold and beautiful curls.
"
"
I have medium length 3A curls and this just wasn't right. I'm not sure if it was too heavy or thick? It seemed to weigh down my curls- I love deva products but this wasn't for me!
"
"
Product is great but this is the second time it has arrived with about 10% of the bottle leaking all over.
"
"
Great
"
"
My favorite gel since I've bought it. It's awesome and soft. Literally only gel I'm buying from now on.
"
"
Product is great.  The fulfillment vendor however did not adequately secure the bottle inside the box for shipping and so it arrived with a broken pump and product spilled out.
"
"
If you want a firm hold, this product is great!  I purchased several Devacurl products.  I would have to say this is my least favorite because it is so stiff...but like I mentioned, if a firm hold is what you're looking for...it's great.  I found I like  a softer curl so I really like the DevaCurl No Frizz foam better for the results I want.
"
"
Be aware that this is NOT a Devacurl product.  It's super watered down and does NOTHING for curly hair but leave it a frizzy mess.  So disappointed.
"
"
I usually love this product.  However, the pump on the bottle leaked from the second time it was used, making it unusable without transferring to a different container.  Cheap packaging!
"
"
Love that this is chemical free. My hair loved it, too. I had great hair all day and even on day 2. I struggle to find a balance of dry/conditioned and frizz/oily looking. I haven't had a gel I really liked in over a year, but I don't have any complaints with this one yet.
"
"
Makes my hair crunchy, even with a very small amount.  Kicking myself for ordering such a large bottle.  If you like crunchy curls, this is great.  I use it for costume purposes now.*edit* I think I am using it wrong, I will adjust my method and get back to you.
"
"
I have been trying every product under the sun to get my hait to ""behave.""  The fact that you're reading these reviews demonstrates you're same journey.  I decided to try the DevaCurl/Care line because NOBODY has trashed the line, and almost every product has had great reviews.  In watching the Deva videos, I determined that I have the Botticelli curly hair type.  According to the videos, I don't even need a gel, but they're wrong.  I purchased this gel because it was said to give a stronger hold than the DevaCurl gel.What I do like about this gel, is that when used as instructed, my curls hang more naturally, and I have cork screw curls towards the bottom.  To get this effect I have to use a significant amount of product (my hair is down to my bottom) my hair has to be super wet and it drips all over me for about an hour.  The curls look great at first, but with movement, they separate and become frizzy and tangled.  I've been using TIGI Massive Shine Hairspray to help to minimize this problem.  With traditional gels, I've been able to wear my hair at least 2-3 days just doing some touching up, but with this product, one day is all I get.  But this gel is not as drying on my hair, so I guess its a trade off.  Unless I saw this product highly discounted, I probably wouldn't buy it again. So far, my best regiment has been to use L'Anza Hair Repair leave-in condidtioner, followed by Arrojo Styling Creme, finishing up with TIGI Massive Shine Hairspray.  It's a little less expensive, totally non-drying, and holds a lot better.
"
"
Tried 2x and both times my thick 2b/c hair came out in one frizz ball. Also texture is sticky on the hair. La looks sport gel is 10x better
"
"
THis is the best product I have found for my ringlets so far.
"
"
This does not work for me it made my hair very crunchy which I do not want.
"
"
As someone who has struggled for most of my 32 years with my coarse, thick, frizzy, naturally curly hair, I have to say this product is as close as I've gotten to controlling my hair.  I have always been more of a mousse fan, my curls are much shinier and defined with a mousse as opposed to a gel, but I have never liked the crunchy feeling that comes with it.  This gel is a perfect solution for me.  It leaves my curls defined, yet very soft.  The only drawback is that if I don't work the product through my hair really well, the result are spots that feel greasy, especially next to the scalp.  My hair reaches almost to mid shoulder blades, and is very thick, so I use probably close to 3 or 4 tablespoons of product.  As long as I do several applications of gel right after I get out of the shower (not one big glob), I don't have an issue with the greasiness.
"
"
The best curly hair gel I’ve found. Good hold without being sticky
"
"
I learned about Deva Care products through a Deva Curly hair stylist about 2 years ago and now love my curly hair again. It keeps my hair from getting frizzy in humid weather and holds the curls firmly or loosely in place depending on how much product I use. I highly recommend this for anyone with curly hair.
"
"
Don’t like it
"
"
Not as impressed with this as the Ultra Defining Gel. Doesn’t seem to hold the curls as well for me. I also miss the smell!
"
"
Not sticky or crunchy, leaves my curls bouncy yet holds them together. Definitely worth it!
"
"
Got curls for the first time in my life.  Don't know what to do with them.  But they are there.
"
"
Great
"
"
Amazing product--my curls are transformed!
"
"
It def makes a cast but once scrunched to release the cast, it doesn't hold as well as I had hoped. I'd say it's good but not super great for slightly wavy hair. Maybe it holds really curly hair much better but then why would you need the gel if your hair was already super curly???
"
"
Like it
"
"
This is not the gel I'm used to buying. Super runny like it's mixed with water. It doesn't even smell like the real stuff. I'm not even going to use this. Waste of money
"
"
Not as great of a product as all the hype led me to expect but still a good product.
"
"
I was not in the least impressed with this gel. I found a drugstore spray gel that met all the criteria set out in the Deva inventor's book Curly Girl for curly products that cost half this price, smelled a lot better and defined my curls and waves better without the slimy feel or the need to soak your hair in it.I'd pass this one by.
"
"
I was introduced to the devacurl line about 10 years ago and I have loved every product I have tried. However, for the past few years I have been living on a budget and have not been able to afford to buy all of their products. The arc angel gel is the only product that I cannot do without. No other gel on the market can compare (and believe me---I've tried them all). Don't hesitate to purchase this product. Your hair will never look better!
"
"
This is a review of only this particular bottle of Deva gel.  DevaCurl Arc Angel Gel is usually a 5 star product for me.  This bottle was runny and did not work as it normally does to control frizz and give hold and definition to my curls.  This batch of gel was either compromised, tampered with, or is not authentic.  I know how this product is supposed to look, feel, and work and this was not as expected. Now I am scared to buy Deva products thru Amazon.  The discounted price is not worth it if the product isn't what it should be.
"
"
If you have curly hair you cannot get any better than the Deva products.  Product came fast, but it was shipped with zero protection with a 10 pound toilet seat so it was squeezed and bit goopy when it arrived, but I rinsed it off and it was fine.  Third item in the last month packaged by Amazon to arrive damaged due to inept packaging.
"
"
Felt terrible on my hair.
"
"
When I buy this product at Ulta it works awesome but something is not right with the one purchased thru here. Hair was sticky, stiff and still frizzy which has never happened when purchased elsewhere.
"
"
Love love love this gel! Lasts for 3-4 days. Just spray my hair with water to reactivate.
"
"
Its too flake
"
"
Really defines curls
"
"
I ordered Arc Angel but got the defining gel instead. I had already tried (and liked) the defining gel but I wanted to try another product. This company seemed to think the two products are interchangeable (are they?) and sent me the defining gel instead. When I contacted them as to why I did not receive the Arc Angel, they said they were out of the product. I would have liked to have received an email stating that so I could make the decision on my own as to whether or not I wanted a substitute. So...no review for Arc Angel, because I never got it.
"
"
Finally! A gel for curly, colored hair that works. This product is perfect. I follow the steps from the Curly Girl book and my hair is so much more manageable with this product.
"
"
The perfect medium weight holding gel that doesn't leave your hair too stiff and it doesn't flake when mixed with other products. Curly hair requires more moisture so it's nice that this product doesn't dry out the hair.
"
"
I love these products for my curly hair.  They are always shipped quickly and are a good price compared to salons. Make sure you learn how to properly use these products through either your salon or online.  It isn't as simple as putting on and walking away.  There is a step to take after your hair is dry to avoid the wet-look.
"
"
Love this but it did come leaking a bit.
"
"
So the 1st time i used this product I put too much in because I'm so used to the cheap stuff & my hair was super stiff. I figured I would need a lot because it really wasn't sticky feeling.The next time I used way less & it was perfect. This is the 1st product I have tried that I didn't have to use half the bottle to get good results. I have been so happy with the Devacurl line & so worth the price. I just wish I would have known of it sooner
"
"
I love the Deva Curl line of hair care products. I used to use Aveda and a few other Target curling products but was left with frizzy, undefined curls.  Now that I use the Deva Curl gel, my curls look great, not frizzy or crunchy.  I'm very happy that I made the switch.
"
"
This is the best gel on the market for curly hair and I've used many. I've used it for years and it never fails. My only complaint is that I can't get the large bottles without the pump and the pump stops working when you get to the last 2 inches of the gel. I open the bottle and get it all out .. sometimes the gel is not as 'gelled' as it should be but it works just fine even when it's a little more liquid.
"
"
not the actual Deva Curl product I get at the salon. Dries my hair out
"
"
I've used this product in the past and I keep coming back to it- I definitely love it! I have 2c curls and this gel is strong enough to keep the frizz down all day (if I use it right). I enjoy the smell, and I love (!) that it's not tested on animals and is curly girl approved (i.e. no sulfates, parabens, waxes, oils, etc).As mentioned by other reviews, you need to use this gel correctly. I apply it to SOAKING wet hair (I leave the bottle in the shower so that I can add it before I get out), and scrunch, scrunch scrunch (with a microfiber towel). Then I use a diffuser to let my hair mostly dry, then air dry the rest. This leave a hard, crunchy cast on my hair (flash back to the 90s- this was gross back then!). AFTER it's dry though, I scrunch with my hands (or some oil) and break the cast. This releases that stiff helmet look, but keeps my hair curly and non-frizzy all day!  LOVE!
"
"
It's a good gel but a little expensive for what you get in my opinion.
"
"
holds my curls all day
"
"
No way this garbage is real Devacurl. Suave mouse is better.
"
"
Arrived the next day! Can’t beat that.
"
"
Good product but not so great for my hair type. The hold is very very light for my taste. It's almost as an not using any gel.
"
"
The answers about a pump say this comes with a pump - what I received has no pump and like the other two Deva products I bought - very difficult to get product to come out of bottle
"
"
One of the best products I've used by Devacurl.
"
"
It doesn't make your hair feel crunchy
"
"
This is the best product I've found; I hope they never discontinue it.
"
"
I love this hair taming gel. It’s light and leaves my curly hair springy without drying.
"
"
Although I love this product and have used it for years when I purchesded it through this seller it came watered down. I checked other reviews and saw other people had the same problem with this seller. Buy the real thing and you will love it, this is far from the real product.
"
"
Perfect. The only thing I need for my frizzy curly hair
"
"
I love the DevaCare product line for my curly hair.  I used to fight with the curls and straighten my hair but decided to stop fighting and give it a try.  The products help keep frizz down and work best if you allow your curls to air dry.
"
"
This is a different gel in the Arc angel bottle! What a scam!
"
"
While it holds the curls individually it does not give me the tighter curls as I expect.  The scent is nice.
"
"
Great
"
"
I use arc angel as the final step in my 3 part Deva Curl hair care regimen. Nearly 1/2 a handful of this product is worked into my wet hair after washing and conditioning. After it is well-distributed, I gently scrunch my hair up from the tips toward the roots, squeezing out the excess water, and promoting my waves to look a bit more curl-ish. I then use a diffuser to partially dry my hair, or allow my hair to air dry WITHOUT TOUCHING IT. You must let the product sit in your hair until it dries. Yes, it will initially feel crunchy, but that is a temporary state. Once dried, I tip my head upside-down, scrunch my hair again, and sometimes give myself a llittle scalp massage to release the 'crunchiness'. After that, this product softens up, and my hair looks amazingly like I've spent hours with a curling iron. Also, it smells amazing. I've used other gels, but they tend to dry my hair out or look flaky after drying. Arc Angel never looks flaky. It was meant for exactly the purpose of defining curls softly. It's a great product for wavy to curly girls.
"
"
My order was quick and smooth. Recieved my Deva Products within a week. I use alot of Deva products and have been happy with all that I have tryed. The best part is it is sulfa free and it leaves my hair feeling smooth. I recommend this for anyone with curly hair that is dry and breaks easy.
"
"
Deva Curl products have changed my life! Go to their website for more info on product use. Arc Angel is a very strong hold for very curly hair. If yours is not ""very"" curly, try a gel a step or two lighter. Great products!! ALTHOUGH, when mine shipped, the pump top was broken :-( It is cheaper on Amazon, but to not risk it, I buy mine at Ulta.
"
"
Product watered down. Poured out like water. Scam. Find a reliable store to purchase this product.
"
"
You know if you're a ""Curly Girl"".  It WORKS.  I don't think anyone would buy it if their hair stylist hasn't tried it on them.  DON'T assume you know how to use it if no one has shown you.  It work FABULOUS if you follow the directions & use the correct towel & technique.
"
"
excellent
"
"
Love all the DevaCare products! Highly recommend following their suggested technique of scrunching hair when dripping wet to bring out the curls. Worth every penny!My only critique is that the style doesn't last longer than a day.. Other products haven't given quite the definition but seem to wear a little longer. That's okay though when you know you have perfect curls! :-D
"
"
I like this gel - it smells great and doesn't leave my hair crunchy, but it doesn't have enough hold. I was hoping for something that would keep my curls all day, but they tend to fall. Using this with the Deva Curl Mist-er Right spray seems to help.
"
"
So far so good...It seems to work and give a definition to my curls...
"
"
This is an amazing product. I literally get stopped by strangers to ask what product I use. I am a loyal deva curl supporter.
"
"
If I just use one pump on my shoulder-length hair, it's perfect. Gives body. Holds curl. Prevents frizz. Looks good 2-3 days! More than one pump makes it sticky. I've had it since November and I've used only about 5-6 oz.  My 32oz bottle my last longer than I do! (I'm no spring chicken.)
"
"
The pump doesn't work. I got 5 squirts out before it broke.  This product requires a pump to efficiently work in order to get the product out of the bottle.
"
"
This product holds my curls tight up until day 3 curls without having to revive it. My curly hair routine is,  cleanse with DevaCurl No poo, condition and wash out with One Condition and style by scrunching dry, reapplying a small amount of one condition and the arc an-gel product. LOVE IT
"
"
Just what I expected and at a fair price.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Out of fairness, I have to edit my previous review. I previously gave it 2 stars because I thought I noticed a big difference between the product I got at the salon and the product I got from Amazon. There is a difference but not as bad as I previously mentioned.  The gel I ordered from Amazon seemed a little “watered down” because it was thinner and the smell was not as strong. I also exaggerated when I said that I only had to use half the amount of the salon product. I do use less but not that much less. Most importantly, the salon product did not make my hair look any better than the Amazon product.  Buying this again on Amazon is not out of the question.
"
"
I have naturally curly hair and have always had to put lots of gel in it to keep it in check.  I purchased this on a whim and just bought another 32oz bottle -- it really works well for my hair!  I generally squeeze out extra water from my hair and then scrunch lots of this gel into my hair (sides, back, flipped)then wrap up my curls in a long-sleeved shirt for a while (sometimes even overnight).  When I let my curls out they hold their curl all day and less frizz.  The bonus with this gel is its lovely citrus-y scent.  It's a favorite of mine.Definitely recommended for ladies with natural curls!UPDATE: I have since purchased this product again and noticed that the quality is different -- the gel seems thinner and does not have as much hold as before.  I'm taking one star off for this.  I think I may purchase it again in the future in the hopes that I just got a ""dud"" bottle.
"
"
i believe i'm in between an ""s"" curl and ""swavy"". i use the shampoo, conditioner and this gel. it makes my hair more curly and defined. i also stopped using a hairbrush (use my fingers on wet hair only) and that probably helps with the added curl. i have been using these products for 3-4 months and don't see myself switching for any reason.
"
"
Great product, light weight nice curls!
"
"
Fast delivery and great product.  Will order again when I run out
"
"
I bought this based on its low-ish score on the EWGs website. Although I usually prefer mousse, this gel does a good job on my hair.
"
"
this is a great gel that does not leave a film and makes my natural curl hold with no frizz.
"
"
I use this daily, even with washing only 1 or 2 times a week there is no buildup and no crunch.  I like the look of silicone gels but not the junk.  To get the same shine as others I scrunch with a light layer of sweet almond oil once my hair is 1/2 dry.
"
"
love it
"
"
This product did not meet my expectation. My hair was very dry and crunchy after using this product.
"
"
Makes my hair feel dry, even with the leave in products to counteract the crunch :( very disappointed.
"
"
For my fine, thin, curly hair, this gel performs better than anything else I've used.  Previously I needed to use a ""cocktail"" of products to get decent results.  With Arc Angel, I only need one styling product to get beautiful curl formation.  I was skeptical that a gel could dry crunchy, but scrunch out to the softest curls ever.  It really works.
"
"
The pump won't work so I have to take it off every time I use it. Very annoying
"
"
Have curly hair and use all deva curl products. They are wonderful! My spiral curls are springy and voluminous.
"
"
Don't care for the product line
"
"
makes hair frizzy, worst gel I've ever bought
"
"
The only thing that keeps my curls intact...I tried everything that was reasonably priced and this was it. I love the large size so I only buy it maybe 3 times a year at most
"
"
This gel holds well and reduces frizz in my curly hair. I like the fresh scent. It was packaged well and shipped promptly. I will buy it again.
"
"
This product works amazing with my natural curly hair. Don't put your hair up in a towel when you get out of the shower. This will cause your hair to dry. Instead, just scrunch the towel to your hair and dry it that way. Put this gel in while your hair is sopping wet, the wetter it is then the better the curls. Afterwards I spray on Mist-er Right & it enhances the curls. Love Deva Curl!!!
"
"
I purchased this along with DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel.  I have never used gels like these before.  When they say it dissolves into your hair, that's exactly what it means. Don't let that fool you when you are applying the product.  I've been used to using cheapo hair gels that coat hair.  It is easy to overdo the Deva gels as the hair really soaks it in.  You will get flakes if you use too much.  Arc AnGell is a medium hold gel.  Provides good definition to waves and also encourages clumping.  My hair's properties are 1c/F/ii using the Fia system.  Using this gel, I can diffuse to a 2b, but it loosens to a 2a after I release the gel cast.  If you have a weaker wave pattern like mine, purchase the Ultra Defining Gel instead.
"
"
I love this product. I was using the ultra defining gel for a long time and then decided to switch to this. I'm so glad I did.
"
"
Firm hold, not crunchy. Soft curls. One of the best products I have found for my type of curly hair.
"
"
Love this for my culrs.
"
"
Best product ever
"
"
I've seached for a product to replace one that is no longer made. This one worked for me. Has enough hold for my fly-a-way curls--keeping them in shape without plastering them down with other 'hold' products.
"
"
Works well
"
"
So much cheaper than anywhere else. If you use this gel, get it here.Works best when you use it on very wet hair.
"
"
Get. This. Now.  :o)  As well as the book, Curly Girl!
"
"
This a a good product for those of us who have curly hair. It is a little expensive, if your hair is long it could get really expensive.I have recommended Deva Curl to several people. So glad it is available on Amazon.
"
"
I received a new bottle of gel on Saturday, used it this morning only to discover that this bottle is grossly watered down! I have ordered from this seller in the past without an issue, but you can bet that this is the last time. This is a lot to spend on a completely useless product.
"
"
Just what I wanted
"
"
Product works great my curls stay soft and bouncy all day without any crunch!
"
"
My wife claims this to be the absolute best curly-hair product on the market.  She's been using, and thus I've been ordering, it regularly for a while now.
"
"
works great full curls without the stiffness
"
"
I use this as the third step in my Curly Girl regimen. It sets my curls beautifully. Once your hair is dry you can scrunch your hair again and there is never any crunchiness to this product like some.
"
"
For my curls
"
"
Great product!
"
"
great product! Gives my curls the separation they needed.
"
"
I love this stuff. It defines curls, keeps the frizz down, and isn't sticky or heavy at all. I don't have to use any other product on my wet hair. Before I started using this I was using a gel, mousse, and anti-frizz. And I never got the results I do now! I'd highly recommend this product to any Curly Girl out there!
"
"
I had SUCH high hopes for this product. Of the four new gels I ordered from Amazon, I was convinced this one would work the best.It's just alright. I've had far better hair days with FX Curl Booster Fixative Gel 8 oz. FX's product gives me a guaranteed great hair day. I used it daily even when I had Graham Webb's Curl Defining Gel. I'd save that for special occasions or when I needed my hair to keep for 3-4 days.Anyway, this gel? Won't be buying again. I can find store bought gels that do about the same.
"
"
I thought with my coarse curly hair this would be better gel than the ultra defining. I found it a little too sticky. A very small amount is alright once in awhile.
"
"
This is a staple in my curly hair regimen.
"
"
great peoduct and service
"
"
This stuff is a miracle for my daughters kinky, curly, blonde hair. No more frizz.
"
"
My hair is no longer dry and frizzy since using Deva Care products!  I love this stuff!
"
"
I love this product and have been using it for quite a while. It maintains an even curl and holds hair well without being stiff. My issue is with the seller, who lists this product in two different ways and sells one for a couple of dollars less, even though it's the same product.  One (12 ounce size) is listed as ""firm"" hold and the other as just the DevaCare Arc AnGel when in fact they are the same product (DevaCare Arc AnGel).  Just didn't want others to fall into the same trap and think that the one defined as ""firm"" was DevaCare's Ultra Defining Gel.  DevaCurl makes 2 products, the regular DevaCare ArcAngel (which is described as a firm hold gel) and DevaCare Ultra Defining Gel.
"
"
A product that I have been using for 10 years. I use it primarily as a hair gel after the shampoo and conditioner. Not too heavy a feel on the hair.
"
"
Definitely watered down. Returned.
"
"
Great for thick hair. Preserves soft curls very well. I was skeptical when a hairdresser tried to sell it to me. But there's just about nothing better for curls.
"
"
GREAT FOR CURLY HAIR!
"
"
Good product for curly hair. I prefer the light citrus scent of this line to the scent of the regular DevaCurl line.
"
"
Have used this product before.  The new bottle I received is very watery and does not hold.  I see several reviews with the same comment.  It is either fake or from a bad batch.  Dissapointed Amazon has not looked into this, will be returning this bottle as it is useless.
"
"
This gel is awesome for fine curly hair! It holds it even for the day after and with me going to sleep on it!
"
"
my hair loves it
"
"
I did not realize the the Firm Hold would also add to the body of my hair.  My hair already has plenty of body.  DevaCare makes great products!
"
"
This isn't quite as strong holding as I'm used to but definitely no frizz.
"
"
Love this stuff.
"
"
Smooth transaction...no problems...thanks!
"
"
Did not work for my thick tight curly hair.  It left it dry and so much shrinkage.  Maybe for someone with looser and longer curls.
"
"
not as good as the curl creme.
"
"
This product combines well with the DevaCare foam.  It washes out so easily also. Not much is needed.  Controls frizz and just apply when wet, then when your hair is completely dry, scrunch it gently and the gel ""cast"" will soften greatly and look awesome
"
"
It is amazing how my curly hair works with the ""deva"" hair cut and this product. Watch the curls grow!
"
"
Arrived in perfect condition and promptly. Excellent product would highly recommend.Keeps curls through second day
"
"
Gel that locks your hair as it dries! leaves it shiny and never gets frizzy. Amazing brand!
"
"
Love.Love.Love. I have used this for years and have no desire to try anything else!
"
"
Works well with the Deva Curl no poo and conditioner.  This system seems to do really well on my hair which is naturally dry to begin with and bleached.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Hold it not very good. Then when it drys it is flaky and tacky, hard to get out, drying.
"
"
I really like this product. The best I've used. It smells nice and helps keep my curls defined yet soft. You do need to know how to practice the ""curly girl"" method for best results. Wish it had a little more hold but it's still the best I've used. I may dilute it to make a spray gel for more hold.
"
"
I always liked this product
"
"
Best thing ever for my hair.  I have curly hair and too lazy to hairspray it straight everyday.  This works incredibly!
"
"
This gel works great for my curly/wavy hair.  I like all the Deva products.  I have no allergy problems with their products like I do others.
"
"
This works very well for good hold.
"
"
I've been using these products for 6 years now. I like that the gel controls my frizz and gives me a nice curl structure without making my hair ""crunchy"".
"
"
Nothing against Amazon or the seller here...everything arrived in great condition, so I am strictly reviewing the product itself. This gel was recommended to me by my hair stylist. With summer around the corner, I opted to order the ArcAngel gel for its more ""controlling"" formula than the other DevaCurl gel.After trying it out, I am truly disappointed in how this stuff performs. I don't have super kinky curls at all, in fact they're usually quite soft and bouncy, but this gel made my hair frizzier than I've seen in years (ZERO no frizz control what-so-ever). While it did define my curls just fine, the frizz was horrible.Besides the frizz issue, my hair looked dull, felt like straw, and was crunchy and hard. I even tried to incorporate this gel with my usual line-up to see if it would work better with some of my other well-performing products..Sadly, I was still disappointed.The only redeeming quality about this gel is that I can use it on days that I don't shampoo to help revive my curls, otherwise, this stuff is pretty much useless in my hair routine. I definitely do not recommend this line.
"
"
the greatest hair product ever for us curly heads
"
"
Deva Curl line is amazzing for curly hair. It keeps it hydrated and non of that alcohol crap. It makes my life easier quick to do my hair. I always get bouncy, healthy curls
"
"
Best hair gel for curly girls! It's been my favorite for years!!
"
"
LOVE the Deva line of products!! But prefer the firm hold
"
"
This product is okay, but it leaves a weird residue feel to my hair.  It's not too hard of a hold but yet it still leaves hair crispy.  I just think I don't like gels and will stick with custards and smoothies since my hair is extremely dry.
"
"
Does not help my hair curl, gives it a very small amount of body if used when my hair is slightly wet.
"
"
great product.
"
"
I love Deva Curl products like nobody's business! I highly recommend all of their product, it's the only stuff I use!
"
"
Gel hold works well. Not as well as Holdon gel. Bit I still like it.
"
"
Love!
"
"
Love  love love this gel. Important to scrunch it and break cast once dry. I highly recommend using deva curl products.
"
"
I got the different product than what I requested.
"
"
So I was in the market for a new gel because I have very curly 3A hair and I had heard good things about this product so I thought ""why not?"". Well, I don't like it. The very first time I tried it I thought it dried waaay too quickly on my hands to really primp my curls the way I'm used to and dried on my hair really crunchy/hard. It felt like it made my hair feel dry and sticky. I used a small sized dollop too. I have to rinse it out of my hair the next day to have a fresh look which is annoying when I can use It's a 10 miracle firm hold gel (mix a nickel sized dollop between hands with a little water and you're good to go) and my curls remain soft and manageable without frizz until the next day. When trying to pull my hair back with this deva gel my hands get almost stuck like glue and my hair doesn't pull back nicely when my hair would be a nice, silky fluid texture otherwise. The product also made my hair frizzy and I haven't had problems with frizz in a long time! I used to like my curls crunchy and hard until I started using Suave Naturals Coconut conditioner co-wash/no shampoo techniques and ever since my unruly hair has become beautiful loopy soft curls that I can manage with a non-sticky gel. The scent of the gel is like a citrus/orange that isn't really appealing to me but it wasn't terribly off putting or anything. The texture of the gel is watery as well.On the other hand my fiance likes it! I noticed my gel was open one day and asked if he used it. He was like yeah it's good stuff. He is Filipino and he's got some natural wave/curl to his hair. I guess it makes his hair nice and hard and the scent doesn't bother him. So it's a win for him because he can keep it and a lose for me because I go back to my It's a 10 gel. This product may work for certain curly hair types but it's a no go for me!
"
"
This product defines my curls better than ever! Wouldn't style my hair without it.
"
"
I love this gel so much, it really helps create nice curls, smells really herbal and fresh, and adds shine. The whole line of Deva products is top notch
"
"
I have been using this product for a couple of years. Love it. My curls stay long using this gel and are very soft still.
"
"
This is actually a good product for controlling curly hair in humid climates. It allows the natural curl in the hair to behave.
"
"
Love this gel! Is amazing !
"
"
Great product
"
"
Didn't work for me.
"
"
Best gel ever! I keep trying to find cheaper options but I always end up coming back to this gel! No other product can make my curls as beautiful as this gel does! I love it and I will continue to buy it!
"
"
I love this gel.  It works so well with my curly hair.  all Deva products I have tried I have loved.
"
"
OK but leaves my hair too crunchy.
"
"
DevaCurl is my new IT for my hair!!!
"
"
Great product for curly hair. Leaves a nice, soft, curly style, without the frizz.
"
"
Love it
"
"
For a girl with very curly hair, I love this product. I enjoy the whole product line of Deva products.Its not sticky. My hair thanks you.
"
"
Great hold for 3b hair.
"
"
My only product to keep my curls form getting frizzy.
"
"
i had high hopes for this product, but it just wasn't enough hold for my hair. I have very fine, very thin, very curly and very frizzy hair and i live in a very humid climate. didn't last all day for me. :(
"
"
Exactly what I expected thank you!
"
"
Best product for curly hair EVER.
"
"
Pay close attention....it looks like this is NOT Deva Curl but it is named Deva Care.  It does not feel, look or smell like Deva Curl.  I bought it and hate the smell of it but did not notice the name until another poster pointed it out.  My hair is not quite as shiny and soft as it was before.  Can't believe they can sell this with the name and look so similar to Deva Curl.  I guess that is why it is cheaper.  I will be more careful next time to make sure I get real Deva Curl products!
"
"
I use this product almost every day for my hair! I have curly and coarse hair, so I don't shampoo it every day, or it would dry out, but every time I use this it does a great job! It lasts a LONG time as you don't need to overdue it and I have long hair! It is firm, but not crunchy. It does not weigh down your hair but hydrates and locks in the curl. I apply after my shower, with my head down towards the floor I often then blowdry it (with a diffuser of course) for a couple minutes at least before work (head still down) to help the curls stay curly. I have been using this product for over 5 years and when you get it in such a large quantity it really is a better value.
"
"
I do not trust my curls with any other gel!!!
"
"
I like the product but I think I prefer the less firming gel. My curls and hair felt better with the other gel.
"
"
Great for frizz control for curly hair. Nice curls without the crunch.  This last batch was a little runny so I'm not sure if its old or if the vendor is diluting it to make it last since its been discontinued.
"
"
amazing hold! love this stuff way better than ultra defining gel!
"
"
A. MA. ZING. It can kinda get a little ""producty"" so you may wanna take a break from it from time to time but it's great.
"
"
Great on my curls devacurl products are amazing.
"
"
This is a great product, doesn't dry out your hair, is not too heavy on the hair and you can combine any number of different shine products with it.
"
"
I would give this zero stars if I could. I bought this product in December and have been using it ever since. My hair has been a frizzy mess. I thought I must have been doing something wrong, so kept adding more and more. Finally I decided to come check out the reviews, and see that this is happening to others as well. I have been using DevaCurl for many years now, and even bought it from Amazon in the past. It's now past the return window and am very frustrated and disappointed
"
"
My favorite product to use on my beautiful curls. My husband loves them!
"
"
Love this stuff!!! Its the best stuff for my curly hair. Leaves them slightly crunchy so that i can fluff my curls to arrange them while still maintaining the spiral. I've used this for 5 years now.
"
"
Best curl product on the market
"
"
Love it
"

Let me begin by stating that I have never written a product review. Ever. I often say, ""oh, I should totally review it!"" but life gets in the way and I don't get around it. But this time, the seller got me so darn peeved that I felt I owe it to curly women everywhere to put this warning out--DO NOT BUY FROM THIS LYING, CHEATING SELLERS.I purchased this product form ASAP several times in the past without complications. The last shipment I received, I used about 2 months after I got it. That's because I always like to keep a stash of products, so I don't run out. Well, I was at a trip in NYC when I first used this bottle. When I first opened it, flipped it over to squeeze out the gel, liquid came out! The product was watered-down! what is this--China?!?!? Give me a break! I was stuck on a trip without my gel. Ya'll know that is awful, right? I know there's a Deva store in NYC but I wasn't going to tell my entire family--sorry, I have to go across town for gel. So, I suffered in frizzy silence. When I got back in town, I emailed them and asked for a refund and that I do not plan on sending the product back for two reasons--1) its been used for several days in NYC (I just used tons of the liquid form...barely worked and 2) I'm not going to take time from my busy schedule to stand in line at the US Postal (OMG are you kidding me?!?!) or pay UPS/FedEx for the mistake of the seller! I even told them that if they reimburse me, I'll let it go, and won't write a review, and I'll even continue to purchase from them, because I'm sure its a fluke. Well, the jerks...they said--return it and we'll see about a credit.long story short--I'm not going to mail it back, I'm just going to stop buying from them. And you should do. Lest you end up with a liquid version of this gel. Crooks!

Far less than the salons, though not cheap by any means.  This product is light and does not leave your hair feeling stiff and ""crunchy"", though it holds quite well.  Love the product, just not always the price tag!  What we pay for beauty...
"
"
This gel is the first gel I have ever used that doesn't leave my hands sticky or my hair crunchy!  I have curly hair and will never buy another gel again.  My curls look product-free, soft, and hold all day.  The cap was damaged in shipping and Amazon customer service was amazing!  Great product, good price, fabulous customer service!
"
"
This gel does wonders for my hair. I get so many complements on my curls and everyone wants to know what I use. Great hold, no crispy or gooey hair after it dries!
"
"
thank you
"
"
Perfect product, exactly as I described and exactly what I was looking for!!
"

I have curly hair and was told my slants that these products cater to curly hair individuals.  They are expensive so I was looking for a way to cut expenses as much as possible.  Amazon offers the products a little cheaper then they are sold in the store.  These products take time to work with and get the optimal affect.  The arc angel is the most important product they sell.  It can harden your hair but it work with helping to define your curls.  It gives them shape and your hair stays in place.  I like the product.
"
"
This works great! Not too stiff and defined curls!!! My hair is very curly and these products are the bomb for my hair!!!
"
"
My hairdresser gave me a sample for holding my curly hair.  Works great !
"
"
Excellent!
"
"
Love this product!
"
"
This was an awesome product, but was delivered in a ""bag"". Some of the product had leaked out into the ""bag"". I would h e sent it back but I didn't want to deal worth the hassle.
"
"
Recently decided to go back to my natural curls.  Tried several products, and this is my preferred curley hair gel.
"
"
Love it.
"
"
This was a gift to my daughter who loves this products
"
"
Ehhhh... doesn't really do much for my curls. I tried it since I heard great things about this brand. It has a very nice smell. But gels just don't cut it for me. I am sticking to my favorite, OGX Argan defining cream. That is much better than this Deva gel or any gel for that matter, which don't provide needed moisture like creams do.
"
"
My hair is a 3b/c type curl and I am disappointed after using this .  The product is described as leaving hair with a firm hold without stickiness or stiffness. Unfortunately, after using this product (with and without leave in conditioner) my hair feels stiff and dry.  I've had to pin it up because genuinely don't like the way my curls feel.  It smells nice and does feel light when applying.  It was my error when purchasing as I bought the bigger bottle versus the 12 oz size. DevaCurl Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel, 32-Ounce Bottle
"
"
Great product it gives my hair that shiny look I want without a sticky feel. I use the product as a part of my daily routine.
"
"
did not hold as well as prior deva product
"
"
I have used this line before (shampoo/conditioner), but I was not quite satisfied with the Defining Gel for my curly hair.  I have alot of curly hair and it didn't feel smooth on my hair but rather crunchy and matted.  If the gel was a little thinner it would probably work better for me.Thank you,Margaret
"
"
It really holds firmly.
"
"
I've been using this product for years. It holds, reduces frizziness, yet doesn't feel sticky.
"
"
great product for curly hair - this has lasted me quite a few months as you only need a small amount!
"
"
This hair gel is great! Especially when used with the Deva Curl Set It Free spray. I would recommend it!
"
"
Love this gel! Holds curls all day long. Never leaves my hair weighed down or crunchy. Defiantly recommend for anyone with curly hair.
"
"
This product is excellent for my frizzy curly hair!No alcohol in it so it dosent dry my hair out
"
"
Product doesn't seem to be the same smell, texture and effect as diva curl at salons. Very sad because I love diva.
"
"
I swear by anything Deva.  Absolute best products for curly hair.  Their website also has great tips.  This is the only gel I will ever use!
"
"
love it

I do not understand how this product has managed to win over my fellow curly haired people. I have 3A hair and was looking for a new gel and after reading raving reviews and having countless curly haired people recommend it, I was ecstatic to try it out. It was such a let down. I don't know how to describe the smell, I guess you can describe it as an artificial citrus smell (obviously it's artificial), but I think this product tried so hard to make the gel smell citrus-y and it just ended up smelling cheap. The gel is very much like a liquid, so even though my hair usually takes about 3-3.5 hours to dry, this product prolonged it. I had to wait forever for my hair to dry. After it actually dried, I expected miraculous curls after being put through that 5 hour or so ordeal, but nope. My hair was super frizzy, gross, dried, and it felt dirty. By the afternoon, my hair felt even dirtier and it looked even worse than it did in the morning: more frizz had built up and it just wasn't even remotely decent. Second day hair is never a success for me and I don't expect my hair to look amazing, but this product made my hair super greasy and just plain nasty. My hair felt greasy and dirty the first day imagine how it felt/what it looked like the second day.I will never understand why this product has received such great reviews because my experience was anything but great. And the product is so expensive too, so I really thought I would like the product (and I really did try to like this product). I've had and am having much better luck  with cheaper gels that aren't even specifically made for curly hair. This product is worth the try if you don't mind spending the money on it, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.
"
"
This Gel holds my curls without making them feel stiff and stuck together.Definitely,one of the best hair products I have used.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Fantastic for curly hair. Right amount of hold, doesn't get sticky unless you play with your hair constantly as I do sometimes.
"
"
PRODUCT IS GREAT BUT PUMP NEVER WORKED THE FIRST TIME. AMAZON REFUNDED MY MONEY, BUT SELLER SHOULD MAKE THIS RIGHT. I READ THE REVIEWS AND OTHERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, BUT I ROLLED THE DICE ON IT ANYWAY, BECAUSE I LOVE THIS HAIR GEL. JUST GET THE SMALL ONE. I AM HAVING TO GET IT OFF OF THE PUMP ITSELF. WHAT A PAIN!
"
"
I have been testing different products for curly hair my whole life and this one is by far the best out there.
"
"
Unpleasant smell.
"
"
Purchased the DevaCare Arc AnGel after reading tons of positive reviews, and while it didn't do everything I'd hoped, I am not disappointed. I was hoping this product would give me more curl after scrunching and air-drying, but apparently it's not a strong enough gel to accomplish that with the weight of my hair. What it did do, however, was define my curls and prevent most of the frizz that I tend to have unless I use LOTS of products. It's got a nice, light texture and I absolutely love the smell. I find it difficult to determine whether I've covered all my hair, so I tend to use a lot of product, however, it leaves absolutely no residue when washing, which is awesome. Perhaps my application needs some tweaking to get the full results I'd hoped for, but overall, I'm pleased with the product and will likely purchase again.
"
"
Love it.
"
"
Something was wrong with this gel. I've been using the gel for a couple of years and this what this bottle contained was different. Not worth the price.
"
"
I decide to try it because ad says it's good but that's not my case. It makes my hair dry and hard to manage. My curly hair is very soft, so this product does not work for me, all the contrary as Cantu that make my curl very defines. Plus the smell is like just pure quimic. I do not like the smell at all.
"
"
I'm so glad this is now being offered at Amazon. Great price for a great product. I wish I had known about it years ago!
"
"
After using this product my hair felt so dry. It also didn't reduce volume enough for me and I used a lot of it. For someone with a thick and very curly hair I think that the Ausie gels that you can buy conveniently from any store will  do a better job.
"
"
I'm a huge fun a devacurl products. I highly recommend all of their products and suggest others to visit their website for tips on choosing the right products.
"
"
Love the Gel but the containers top doesn't work.  It wouldn't turn to use the pump to get the gel out.
"
"
Not authentic Deva Care product, made my head itch and hair became very crunchy!!!
"
"
I used it yesterday and my hair came out great. I have the Angel light hold, which works great too. I needed alttle extra hold. My hair is very long, curley and heavy. It gives me a curl from root to end and it's not crunchy.
"
"
Hydrates curls -- as described.
"
"
I use this everyday!
"
"
Lightweight, nice smell!
"
"
Love!
"
"
great service and I get lots of compliments on my hair
"

Product was leaking when I received it, otherwise it was the product I ordered.
"
"
Everything was great and just as ordered....
"

This is my wife's product, so I'll write my review and hers.Hers: she loves it, it helps with her curly hair.Mine: it's shampoo. It cleans her hair. Makes her look beautiful.

I HATED this gel back when I used to style my hair by twisting each strand around my fingers, (making me look like apoodle, what choice did I Have?).Then I booked a cut with Ana on a whim in Dec 08.  Who knew a cut was that important.  I've been to another curly hair salon (am I allowed to name?  Ouid*d in NYC).I hated the result.  At Devachan, I was TAUGHT how to use the products and it's changed my ritual.  I truly thought only I knew how to style my hair (naturally, after all my hair disasters).Now, I style with One Condition (yes, it can be used as a styler! How cool is that!).  I put it in my soaking wet hair & then scrunch the water out the sides with a men's wife beater.  Then flip my hair upside down & scrunch water out, especially @ the roots so I don't have flat head.  Then I SCRUNCH this gel INTO my hair, first the sides then back then over the outside of hair.  This is the 1st time I ever wore hair products where I didn't saturate my hair and wait HOURS for my hair to dry before looking good.  I am so happy I don't look like a wet poodle anymore!  Oh and ESMERELDA highlighted my hair using the Pintura method (like balayage, hair painting the highlights on).  She is like an artist.  My hair always looked tiger stripey (and silly, really) but she gave me golden blonde highlights and broke up my base (it took 5 MINUTES to break my almost black base to a golden brown, unbelievable).  Also, I wasn't nickel and dimed.  I was told my highlights were $189 and that is exactly how much I paid for them.  And she styled me afterwards, no surprise add ons.  Last time I had highlights my hair felt like straw (highlights and curls don't usually mix).  This time, there wasn't a single difference in texture.  I feel so purdy!WARNING: You will receive too many compliments on how good ur hair smells (enter conceited strut).Just a hint, the reason you don't need so many products is these really hold the curls into thick clumps of voluminous large curls rather than thin strands of curls.  If you try it this way or have Devachan teach you, I am sure you will love it.  It took me 2 tries before I was like, ok I can do this confidently.  OH AND I USE THE CLIPS AT MY ROOTS WHILE I DO MY MAKEUP. I can even wake up and go by spraying in a lil ""Set if Free"" and adding more One Condition.  And I No-Poo once a week instead of washing everyday. I just wash my scalp everyday with conditioner (I use Lanza Healing Color Care Conditoner since I have a HUGE gallon and don't want to waste it. It works really good).  I hope this helps someone!

I bought this gel directly from Bed bath and beyond so I know it is authentic. I was so excited to try this gel. It cost over 20.00 but I had high hopes. When I first put it in my hair I liked the product but didn't think it was that great. After about the first 3 hours my head started itching and the itching continued into the next morning. The itching got so distracting that I had to shampoo my hair immediately to get it out. I just returned it. Do NOT recommend. Ridiculously expensive crap. I am sticking with Tresemme max hold gel. Way better and affordable.
"
"
This did absolutely zero for my hair.  It didn't hold my hair at all and didn't control frizz.  What a waste of cash!  My stylist recommended No-Poo, Set It Free and Arc Angel and I, foolishly, purchased all three products because he assured me that for best results I should use all three in conjunction with one another.  Hogwash!  Now I'm out $60 and have almost full bottles stashed in my hall closet that I have no intention of using again.  What a waste.  I don't know what all the hype about this hair care line is about.  Perhaps those with curlier hair benefit in some way, but there are less expensive products that work much better.  Got2be Shine Serum controls frizz even in high humidity and their Kinkier mousse is strong but not crunchy and the hold lasts all day.  I have no idea what I'll do with what's left of the Deva products.  Perhaps someone with curly hair will come into my life and I can offload them on someone else.  I surely won't use them ever again.  The No-Poo is no better than VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner (I secret I discovered from a beauty review website) and is ten times less expensive.  Again, what a waste.  Spend your money on a nice bottle of perfume or some such luxury.  Skip this line, there's nothing worthy of the expense.  I definitely don't recommend this product.
"

Best curl gel ever tried and I've tried a ton!  I use this with the Devacurl coconut super cream styler and find its the BEST combination for my fine wavy/curly hair.  I also use the Devacurl shampoo and conditioner.  The best aspect of this gel is that there is NO CRUNCH!  So happy with this product.
"
"
I regularly purchase this product from ulta and have never had a problem. For some reason this formula that I recieve from this seller does not work the same. My curls do not look hydarated and I have lots of frizz going on. Definetly not pleased with this product from this seller and will not purchase again from this seller.
"

Ladies check google for the latest in Deva CURL BEING SUED  for baldness and alopecia.

A lot of other curly hair product lines require that you use their special shampoo, their special conditioner, their special gel, their special leave-in conditioner, etc. in order for your hair to look good (and each of these things can cost $20 or more).  I've tried a lot of different products for my thick, unruly, curly hair and nothing has worked better than DevaCare Arc Angell.  I can use whatever shampoo and conditioner I want--including the cheap stuff from the drug store--and as long as I follow with Arc Angell my hair looks great!  Even better is that my hair isn't sticky, nor does it have that plastic hair gel look to it.  It looks natural and soft.
"
"
I have used many DevaCurl products and have been very happy with them so I was very disappointed in the gel. It is very watery and I need a lot to keep my hair from getting frizzy. My hair dries in a strange curl and is very hard and sticky. I have a tough time scrunching the crunch out and if I succeed, it is a poofy mess. I follow the whole curly girl hair regime. I use DevaCurl no poo shampoo, leave in conditioner, scrunch dry with a t-shirt, apply gel then clip to dry. I have better luck with the much less expensive brands of hair gel.I bought this gel because there were many 5 star reviews that specifically mentioned that it did not dry hard or sticky. I am not sure why I am having no luck with it.
"
"
I did not think it was possible but my hair was left straight. After the air dry, there was absolutely no curls. I have 3C type of hair and it was nothing but a big afro. Yes it was smooth and sort of frizz free, but what happened to the curls?! thumbs down.
"
"
I really like this product. According to curlmart.com I have 3a/b type curls or Botticelli curls according to Deva Curl. I like this product because it gives me definition without making my curls feel greasy or sticky. If I use too much it can make my curls hard and crunchy so I put a half dollar coin size in my hand. I flip my hair upside down & scrunch it in from the bottom up. I also use moose & gloss drops before I add this product into my hair.
"
"
This product is a godsend. It is expensive, but worth it.Don't waste your money buying this from the salon. They will charge you 40$ or more! Amazon is the cheapest I have found the Deva products.Arc Angel applies easily, dries quickly, and shakes out, leaving your natural curls bouncing for days.Seriously, if you cannot afford the shampoo, conditioner, and styling product....spring for the Arc Angel Gel.You won't be disappointed!
"
"
This is a great product for keeping curly hair tame. I was also impressed that this company had the gel arrive in the same amount of time that I was told it would.
"
"
If your hair gets poofy, Deva Arc Angell may help.  My coworkers and friends commented that my hair looked curlier after using this product. It does hold my curls better than anything else I've ever used and can be reactivated by spritizing with water. However, it IS a heavier product that did make my hair feel as though it was being ""weighed"" down. On humid days, it felt sticky.
"
"
Curly girls rejoice! I have super tight corkscrew curls, with fine hair. The result is that I either have a fabulous hair day, or I have pure frizz that once resembled a curl. This product makes about 80% of my hair day's fabulous, as opposed to the usual 40%. I resisted Deva Curl for so long because of the price point, but found it is well worth it. I definitely recommend checking out their website to see what product you should get for your specific curls, but ordering through Amazon (it's slightly cheaper on some products).
"
"
My curls fight a top layer of fizz. The usual solution is strong styling cream or gel, in fact my stylist advised me to use the strongest gel Deva makes (I don't fit the hair ""profile"" described on the B'Leave-In package). However, besides the Set it Free spray, I had yet to find a Deva styling product that I truly liked and that could keep the fizz at bay all day. In spite of only using No Poo and always conditioning with my One Condition and even my beloved Set it Free, my hair was looking dry and extra fizzy (summer woes, I guess). I bought B'leave-In on a whim for a conditioning leave-in treatment....however, to my surprise this is the best styling product I have ever used! I wish they sold it by the gallon ;) While my hair is soaking wet, I mist with Set it Free then use B'Leave-In like you are supposed to use the gels--generous amount, squish through curls. The result is what I always wanted the gels to be and unlike the gels...no fizz...no matter how long my day goes. It looks great while it's drying (you don't have to be paranoid about touching your hair before it dries...it is touchable throughout), dries fast (the gels took forever for me) and looks even better dry...it doesn't weigh down my curls (I don't have to use any clips while it dries)...perfect for my ""wash and go"" life style. Styling products are a subjective experience, what works for one might fail for another...but if you need some extra hydration this is worth a shot.
"
"
I already had the hang of getting good curls, but this leave in conditioner took things to the next level! It holds without crunch, and I have gorgeous bouncing, fat, coiled curls! I use this on dripping hair, then Wavemaker styling cream, then Ultra defining gel and some John Frieda frizz ease to seal it all. Then I scrunch/blot with a microfiber towel and blow dry-diffuse. Perfect every time! Thanks Devacurl, I’m a DevaGirl now!
"
"
You are doing yourself an injustice if you don’t get this. For 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th day curls I use water mixed with conditioner in a spray bottle and this. That’s it!!  My wavy curls look and feel so great!!  This is probably the best deva curl product on the market.
"
"
It was recommend I use this product after my first Deva haircut about a year ago and I now don’t use anything else.  It’s a little more expensive that regular stuff but I find the amazon price the best and it’s convenient. I now don’t use anything else.  Other products left my hair stiff, crunchy and wet looking.  I use it with their frizz free foam product too.
"
"
I have s'wavy hair (if you've read the DevaCurl book and are familiar with the curl type). This product was recommended to me by my stylist when I got my first Deva cut. I absolutely love it! I put a half-dollar sized amount onto my palm, fold it between my two hands, and work it through my hair from root to end right after I turn off the water and right before I put in the Ultra Defining Gel.
"
"
I like it. It’s no miracle product and it took a couple of weeks for this to win me over. I had to toss my other products out and only use this (doesn’t really go well with anything else) but I like it because I don’t have to wash my hair almost every day. The other stuff made my hair nasty and would take forever to wash out, this product leaves my hair soft even after multiple applications and a couple of days. It has no smell though so that was a bit of a downer for me.
"
"
I have been using Deva Curl for some time.  This is the the first time i have order this particular product. I like it better than the gel I have used for 5+ years.  I have fine hair, medium thickness and soft curls...  it leaves my hair feeling soft and supple and not heavy.
"
"
Extremely surprised regarding consistency of the product. Have purchased from Ricky's prior to this. Ricky's purchase had a nice smell and product was almost watery, easy to dispense. This product was thick with mini clumps when tube was squeezed. Had a weird smell. Product seemed to have been sitting on shelf for awhile in heat. I have disposed of this item and will be purchasing this item from an outside vendor.All other deva curl items I've purchased from Amazon have been great. Was disappointed about this one.
"
"
I was very skeptical about this product and how it would ""plump"" up curls. I have very dense, coarse hair, so I don't really need ""plumping"" but it is amazing at curl clumping! A little goes a long way and it helps to get curls and coils popping before a gel. I would not use this product as a moisturizing leave-in or alone (for my kinky curly hair), but it works great under a gel to get very defined, shiny, curls.

Product itself is great. It tames my otherwise frizzy curly hair for over 24 hours, since I use this before I go to bed and my curls look great in the morning. Much cheaper here than in hair salons or Ulta.
"
"
Exact same product as in the salon. Tube came sealed. I have wavy hair and if I want to go in the curly side, I out this product in first.
"
"
This is a ""splurge"" for my hair andI love that I can find it cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else. I do the LOC method for my curly hair and this is the best leave in for my 3c hair especially in this high humidity city I live in
"
"
If you are looking for a flexible hold this is not the right product. Makes my hair feel crunchy and not a fan of the smell.
"
"
Fast shipping and great product.  I love everything I've tried in the DevaCurl line, but this is my favorite so far.  It plumps up my fine 3B curls and minimizes frizz.  I like using this with the light defining gel.
"
"
I use this in my wavy style hair.  Gives me volume and adds more curl definition to my hair.  I use gel on my hair after use the B'Leave in Curl Boost.  Would definitely buy again!

It's a nice product but for the price I expected more my hair didn't look or feel better than if I used a product half the price
"
"
Do not buy this product. I have naturally curly hair and have tried a lot of different products. I've heard great things about DevaCurl so decided to give this a try. I'm concerned that the product is expired or is not an authentic DevaCurl product as it didn't work well and it flaked off my hair after drying, making it look like you have dandruff. Also, this product is not returnable, so I'm suck with it.
"
"
I am a big devacurl product fan and b'leave in is currently my go to leave in. Love it!!
"
"
I use this ever time I wash my curly hair. I love the feel and smell and my hair feel sooo dry without it. It doesn't weigh down my hair and it adds in tons of moisture.
"
"
be careful with the amount you put on.  i am a deva curl devotee for over 12 years and have boticelli curls.  if i put too much of this on my hair can feel weighed down.  nearly each day i use deva care one condition, then b'leave-in, and finally angel.  i use no-poo 2 times/week for deeper cleansing.  :-)
"
"
Love this product! My usually freezy hair is not straight nor it is curly. This product allows to keep hair under control and a keep a natural tidy curl in place. I have tried different brands, this one is the only one that works. I used to pay almost double the price at the salon, too.
"
"
Love this!! Helps define curls!
"
"
Nice
"
"
Good stuff, it works.
"
"
Gives curl definition
"
"
Love love love this product.  My curl came alive with  bouncy soft curl that lasted a couple of days after one wash.  Great product!!!!!!
"
"
perfect
"
"
Best for curly hair that I have ever found!
"
"
I love the weightless feel it gives my hair
"
"
I use Deva Curl products all the time and love them. This I am NOT a fan of, doesn’t do anything at all.
"
"
I was really hoping that this product would give my curl's life but sadly it did nothing for my hair other than make it feel like it had product in it. I'm going to try the Deva Curl mousse and pray that it maintains and manages my curl's.
"
"
The smallest amount goes a long way! Long how the curls hold up for at least 12 hours before having to redo my hair. My hair stays really soft too. Works great with a diffuser.
"
"
absolutely wonderful for controling frizz and adding bounce and longevity to my loose natural curls
"
"
This gel works wonders for my curls
"
"
This is one of the best curl enhancers that I have purchased, and I have purchased a lot of ""duds"" within the last three years.  It works!
"
"
Bought for my daughter. She loves this stuff.
"
"
This product doesn't work at all....No way to contact company through Amazon
"
"
This is a great product! I have very curly hair but it gets frizzy and the curls aren't that nice. Since I have used this product there's no frizz and my curls look beautiful
"
"
If u have natural hair u will love this product
"
"
Love it. Love all Deva products. Except that crazy diffuser, that's whack.
"
"
Such a great leave-in conditioner. I ran out after about a month, and broke down and bought the large bottle. Use it like you would the gel: turn your head upside down and scrunch your hair toward your face. It nicely saturates the ends and makes your hair sooooo soft.
"
"
B’leave is the perfect addition to my Deva Curl routine and defiantly adds nice volume once dry.!
"
"
I have used DevaCurl products for years and absolutely love them.  This, however, has been the exception.  My hair is not any more moisturized than before and I think it's flaking off on my scalp.  It also smells pretty bad.  I'm all for not putting more chemicals into a product just to make it smell good, but sometimes it's necessary.  I will not be purchasing this again.
"
"
This is my least favorite of the DevaCurl products. It doesn’t do much of anything.
"
"
This product, like the no-poo and conditioner has a very strong chemical smell which takes a long time to fade.  I used this on my daughter's hair and it takes a couple days for the smell to go away completely.
"
"
Tames my frizzy hair.  Kind of slimy in the hand, but does not gum up my hair.
"
"
I have very fine, dry, fragile, corkicelli-ish curls and I've been exclusively using Deva products in the hopes that my hair will become healthier.  But until this stuff, I have sooo missed my silicone gels!  B-Leave-In feels really weird in my hair when it's wet (can't explain the weird feeling - thick and almost dry feeling...? ), but it works!  It gives me thick, springy, shiny and soft curls with absolutely no feeling of residue.  As other reviewers have said, it doesn't really hold, so I also use some ultra-defining gel first, (after a dab of Heaven-In-Hair).  Like other reviewers, I also experience some itchy scalp from the botanicals in Deva products.  In combo with my Q-redew, I feel much more in-control of my curly locks and will be buying the big size next time.
"
"
DevaCurl B'Leave-In gave my 3A curls a real boost in the arid climate of Arizona. I highly recommend this product.
"
"
A bit gooey but otherwise works well....and not tested on animals.
"
"
Perfect for my curls!!
"
"
waste of money.. makes my hair dry
"
"
I have thick 4c hair. This product is very moisturizing. However it leaves flakes. I wont buy it again.
"
"
Awesome product. The only thing that makes my curly hair behave and look well groomed instead of looking like a dry tumbleweed.
"
"
nice product, cheaper price, came as promised, same as picture, nice product , good price , good price, ok company
"
"
I absolutely love this product! Is a must for managing my curls!
"
"
Love this combined with KMS Curl-up perfecting lotion. Works well for my natural curly hair. Great price from Amazon.
"
"
So far my wife loves the product.
"
"
As expected
"
"
Hair gel.
"
"
This product was advertised and prevention magazine I thought I'd give it a try. The price was right in the product I love and have been recommending to my Curly Head friends
"
"
Great product for this curly-head. I've been trying curly-haired products for 40 years and this one is one of the best I've tried. Leaves curls soft and natural--not sticky or hardened.
"
"
Devacurl makes my hair very dry.. no matter the product it just does.
"
"
OMG a staple product in my life now!!! GREAT for my crazy to control hair!!!
"
"
my hair is fine this didn't work for me good product though
"
"
Works great!  Love it!
"
"
I love how my hair feels, its perfect for my curls
"
"
Great product
"
"
it leaves to many flakes in hair hate it barely use it for the price sucks
"
"
This curl gel is fantastic! My hair is wavy curly and this really helps me hold the curl in my hair. Smells great, too!
"
"
It works. Believe.
"
"
Great product for low porosity and/or fine naturally curly hair.  It not only enhances my curls, but also adds shine.  Will definitely purchase again.
"
"
very happy, I use along with the arc angel gel and it seems to hold my curls better and makes them softer to the touchouse than the gel alone.
"
"
Perfect leave in conditioner. Defines and hydrates my curls.
"
"
Love this curl primer!!
"
"
Didn't pump up my curls like I thought it might, but it's not a bad product.
"
"
my favorite hair care for curly hair!
"
"
Did not respond to my hair.
"
"
I love all the DevaCurl products. This one meet my expectations for my daughters hair and I would recommend to those with beautiful curls.
"
"
doesn't work for me. too sticky
"
"
deva products are the best, you can just re wet your hair the next day and it will reactivate this gel
"
"
Can be greasy if you use too much. I did not notice a huge boost in curl. Also, this product clogged my pores and I'm now trying to get rid of this acne. Do not use on the hair closest to your face.
"
"
Doesn't hold as well as most gels. Smells great.
"
"
I use this on 2nd or third day wash and go to refresh and my curls look gorgeous ans the first day wash
"
"
I have searched for a line of products for my curly hair my entire life.  This is THE stuff...even in a humid or dry climate.
"
"
This stuff is AMAZING!  Makes life with curly hair so much simpler!
"
"
When get dry, the hair look dirty(white flakes).
"
"
Really great product for curly hair!
"
"
I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.It's a super addition and it smells terrific too!
"
"
This is the best product for curly hair that I've tried so far. It leaves my curls soft and bouncy, and it feels super light! I've tried tons of other products, to include others Deva gels and cream, but this is by far the best for my hair type. Love it!
"
"
Love this stuff!! I have wavy to curly hair. The gel helps maintain curls without frizz.
"
"
Love this product this whole line is a must if you have curls
"
"
I have fine curls and a medium amount of hair.  (not thick/not thin)  This product didn't really have enough weight for me - my fine texture requires some oomph so it doesn't just turn into fluff.  Maybe it would be better for someone with coarser or thicker hair, but it didn't do anything for me.
"
"
I really tried to like this product...but I could never get the application right and it always left my hair looking greasy. It didn't do much for my curls either.
"
"
Excellent for curly hair!
"
"
LOVE. Will try more of DevaCurl's products in the future.
"
"
This product is far less sticky than gels I've used in the past and does a better job in defining and holding my curls.
"
"
Excellent product! Very happy with price as well.
"
"
it is an ok I still have a little frizz
"
"
Very happy with this product as it is light but effective
"
"
Makes my fine 2b hair MUCH fuller.
"
"
Works well with the ultra defining gel.  I am getting a little more volume at roots and nicer curls all around.
"
"
Good curl booster without the crunch. Did not add volume to my hair.
"
"
I like this for my curly hair. Great and fast shipping.
"
"
Great!!
"
"
nice
"
"
smells amazing, kind of light, it didn't give my hair (s-wavy) enough curl and made my hair a little too soft
"
"
Am in love with this, leaves my curls soft and manageable.
"
"
very good for curl, but with hair defuzer, it live small white stuf on the hair
"
"
I have been using the Deva Curl Creme for a few years and love it, so I decided to try this, as well.  I TOTALLY regret this!! I just tried to find out how to return the product and get a refund and found out that the product is NON-REFUNDABLE.  This stuff is horrible, and the smell is completely nauseating.  I feel like maybe the reason it's 'non-refundable' is because it is old and rancid or something.  I do NOT recommend that anyone purchase this product.
"
"
leaves flaky residues on the hair when it dries up.
"
"
I am a DevaCurl girl for life. I love their No-Poo, Low-Poo and One Condition and use daily. I used the B'Leave In for a few months and it made my curls look beautiful! Shiny, defined, frizz free, and soft to the touch. The only downside is the white fluffy flakes that fell out of my hair after using for a few weeks. I think the product is either cheaply made or just builds up over time on the hair. If it didn't flake, I would still use it. I switched to using Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner paired with Deva Curl Light Defining Gel. My hair needs  a leave-in conditioner as I have 3B curls that need lots of moisture and hold, which is why I use the Mixed Chicks. Deva Curl doesn't really offer any other kind of leave-in conditioner which I believe most curly girls need. You could simply not rinse out all of the One Condition while in the shower and then use the Light Defining Gel, but I'm usually in the shower too long and end up rinsing all of the conditioner out. It also depends on the type of curls you have. My curls are very dry and need a LOT of moisture. A leave-in is a must.
"
"
Flakes in my hair and doesn't hold up well in humidity.
"
"
I was excited about the product, but it left a horrible white residue in my hair.
"
"
I still haven't figured out how to use this product in a way that is best for my hair. If I use it after I condition with OneCondition, my hair is flat. If I use solely as a leave-in conditioner, it sometimes looks nice, but if I use too much it weighs it down. I have very fine hair so I don't know if this is the right product for me, but I'm sure on some people it works very well. I guess you don't know until you try.
"
"
This products makes my curls pop.  I mostly use the curl boost when I put my hair in a high bun which then makes my curls turn into tighter waves.  I only need to use a little. It glides through the hair and isn't sticky and it doesnt leave your hair hard. I have 4A-4B with an unusual amount of 2 and 3C.  I wouldn't style my hair without this product.
"
"
I love this stuff!
"
"
Received product and it had leaked over the rest of my shipment, through its protective plastic wrap. Has a half inch hole at the top that I have to use to dispense the product (if I open the cap and try to squeeze it, product comes out both ends) It sucks to pay so much for a product, only to lose a portion from poor packaging. Aside from busted packaging, the product itself seems to work well in controlling my frizz and adding more pronunciation to my curls.
"
"
It works.  It turns my waves into a curlier mane. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves their curls!
"
"
I really like this product for holding curl & conditioning my hair at the same time.  I have wavy hair that is curlier if I let it dry & use this product.  It keeps my hair from looking frizzy and has a soft hold.  I mix a little of it with the light hold gel that Deva makes.
"
"
Great texturizer. great for curl definition.
"
"
The product had a strip of clear/dirty packing tape across the lid...over a old/dirty identification sticker...all over the original label.  Super gross looking.  Peeled off the tape and sticker and rubbed out stickiness with Goo Gone...again, gross!  TG there was one of those tin seals over the opening of the product hole!
"
"
I have some where in between 2C and 3A curls. I've been doing the CG method for about a year and a half. This product is great for my hair. Its got a smooth thin texture. I have used it as a substitute for gel: it gave a lot of texture and volume to my hair, but no hold. Now I mix it with the Ultra defining gel ( about 1/4 b'leave-in gel, 3/4 gel) and that works pretty well for me. I'm a guy, and I don't prefer super fruity scented products, but this product smells really fresh. I think this product would work well on all kinds of hair, but I dont have experience with coarser hair or tighter curl patterns. Can't wait to try it on my 2A-2B friend's hair!
"
"
Really helps hair curl. I use it in tandem with a leave in conditioner and now on my hair washing days my hair can still look really good. No more waiting until my hair is dirty to look good haha.
"
"
This stuff really works, oh my gosh this is the best thing that could of happened to my hair. I use it everyday, just a little and it curls just fine. The only bad thing is I think Deva Curl is a little pricey but what the heck a girl gotta do what a girl gotta do.
"
"
Love this item!! Does exactly what it says it will do.
"
"
love it
"
"
I tried DevaCurl products through my co-workers and had to try some more on my own. I've only used it this week but I can tell I ordered the right product. This B'Leave-In curl boost and volumizer is just what my hair needs. I have very fine hair and using this really adds the volume and conditions my hair. Can't wait to work on it again for the weekend!  Great item!
"
"
I love how it moisturizes my hair and keeps it confirmed throughout the day. I love this product!
"
"
Totally great to really define those curls!
"
"
I've tried so many different gels but always stuck to mousse because it's what worked best for me. I figured I would give this a try and man do I LOVE IT!! My curls are soft, well defined, and bouncy just the way I like them! I use my Deva Diffuser (can't go without it) to dry my hair and it's just perfection. Will definitely be using this from now on even if it's more expensive than the mousse.
"
"
Really a good product for the price. Best on naturally curly hair. Its a light weight product that keeps the frizz down and the curl up!
"
"
I have kinky/wavy hair and this seems to be the only product that really helps tame it.  It helps to give my hair a more controlled curl, rather than crazy, kinky 'I just put my finger in a socket' look.  It doesn't dry my hair out and leaves it soft and light.
"
"
Like this product, works well.  All these products are great and work really well with my hair.  I love the conditioner  Just trying to get enough words.
"
"
I put this on my loosely curly hair when it is half dry by rubbing it on my hands and scrunching my hair. Then I let it air dry.  It holds the shape of the loose ringlets well without looking plastic.  It reduces frizz.  When I feel my hair after it dries, it feels natural and nearly soft.  Best leave in conditioner I've ever used.
"
"
Works great with my hair
"
"
Very good
"
"
I'm very disappointed w/the B'Leave-In. I've been searching for a better leave in conditioner. According to the description this product should have ended my search. Initially, it was great. My hair felt light and the curls were defined. But about an hour after my hair drying, my hair looked dry, really really dry.  And I had HUGE corn flake size flakes through out my hair. Sadly, the search continues.
"
"
Curl boost it is! I really didn't need that. I bought for volume which it helps at, but makes my hair way too curly.
"
"
I am a new devacurl gal but I liked this product. It isn't too sticky or crackly when it dries either. I do think it helps to define my curls. Wavy curly.
"
"
It smells good. But, my curls didn't stay.
"
"
The product had slit in it when I received, I do not know if it was tampered with ...
"
"
This itchesmy scalp.  It smells nice.
"
"
Best stuff ever.  Light weight on your hair.  I even use it to freshen up and tone down frizz on dry hair.
"
"
I have been using this for years and it really seems to do justice to my long & wavy hair.  I Devacurl products are of very good quality, but wish they were a little more affordable.
"
"
I love Deva products, but not this one. After using it with set it free it left my hair full of flakes. I tried it twice to see if it was a fluke, but the same thing happened. Maybe I received a fake batch.
"
"
I like the product, but the foil covering the opening cut my thumb. Ouch!
"
"
quem tem cabelo afro e quer definir os cachinhos é perfeito, eu nao consigo tirar a mão do cabelo, meus cachos nunca foram tã definidos.Vendedor confiavel, chegou em 5 dias.
"
"
Excited to try this product but upset that the top of the container has a cut. Thus when I opened the shipping bag there was gel all over and now gel is oozing at the top instead of the dispenser. Upset....
"
"
Love the product, but not the way it arrived! Now it's going to be difficult to use it this way.
"
"
I love almost everything from DevaCurl but a is my fav right now. As most curly girls know curls are not super easy to maintain and you just have to be okay with looking like a monster sometimes, I’ve been having the best luck with this product as far as decreasing my monster days. I spritz in the morning with a mixture of water and one condition then style with B’Leave-In. These are curls after three days of no washing! AMAZING!
"
"
In my experience, this item was horrible. I have never had a product produce such a terrible build up on my head. I bought three products from this line, this, the Low Poo cleaner and conditioner. I was extremely disappointed in this line.  For almost a month I gave this a chance, switching up the way I used it, giving my scalp a chance to adjust to the low-poo. I gave up. The embarrassment of my flaky white head was just too much for me.The first day I used all three products I was quite happy. No doubt this gel really enhanced my wavy hair. It gave it a very nice natural  curl. I have wavy/type 2 hair that tends to frizz bad. This did help control the frizziness. My goal in buying these products was to avoid washing daily as I usually do, to help control the dryness. In research I realized that washing my hair daily was drying out my hair even more. So, I was on a mission to bring my hair back to health.  The first day was great and I was impressed. But on day 2 it happened. My scalp started to itch...bad. I tried not to scratch because I didn't want to make my head irritated or peel. On day 3 was when I washed my hair. I noticed the white flakes on my head. At this time I assumed it was from my scalp, dandruff? I thought. I tried not to scratch. I showered with the shampoo and conditioner, I styled my hair with this product. And moved on with my day. By evening my head felt itchy. I would tap my head but not scratch hard, I didn't want to make my scalp flake because again, I thought it was dandruff. Day three I shampood and conditioned my head again, then I noticed the build up was worse! The shampoo was not removing the build up. What ever is in the shampoo was not cleaning my hair enough to remove all these white crap on my head. And to make it worse, on wet hair it looked worse. It looked like I had an infestation of lice. I was in shock.This happed one more time before I finally decided I had to stop using the shampoo ( I forgot to mention at one point I thought I was allergic to the shampoo or conditioner, never thinking the problem was the gel).So I did. I changed shampoo and starting using another one. It took three washes to remove the white flecks of mess in my hair. So I stared fresh. I cleaned my hair and styled it using the gel. Few days later, white flakes. I realize that it was not dandruff but the product. The product dries and gets crusty, flaky whatever, you want to call it on my hair. Terrible. I used it today, only put it from my mid head down to roots, avoiding my scalp, hoping that would help. Nope, I was wearing a black sweater and there was white specks on it. I'm sure my head is full of product residue right now as I type.  I am forced to wash it daily, and even then it all doesn't come out in one wash. I will no longer use this line of product. I don't know why it happened to me and not to more people who review. It got good reviews and I had high hopes. But I can honestly say I have never had such a bad experience with any product that way I did with this. I had to constantly be checking in the mirrow to make sure I had no ""dandruff"". Oh, and I guess I should mention it has a really bad cheap plastic smell ...with a dash of lemon.  I wanted to add a pic of the nasty hair product build up, but I don't see that option :(
"
"
I'm always looking for a product that I can put in when my hair is wet and I end up with curls that  bind together, shine and look like the could spring and bounce. This product did not do that for me. Out of the three weeks I have used it, sure I had some good hair days but always because I combo'd up with other things like, Oribe mouse and Kerastace shine oil. This product certainly cannot be used alone and since I had to supplement it with such other expensive products to have good hair days, I felt that this was just a total miss.
"
"
This does a great job of brining out my curls and adding moisture and shine.  It controls the frizz as well. I always get compliments when I use this product.
"
"
I bought this to use in conjunction with the DevaCurl sulfate-free shampoo. After cleansing, I squeezed out some of the water and applied this product to very wet hair, scrunching it as I usually do. It looked okay at first, but later when my hair was completely dry I noticed some crusty stuff in my hair and realized that the dried product was flaking off of my hair. I'm not sure why this happened, and no one else mentioned this happening to them. I've tried it twice with the same results, but I'll give it one more shot before sending it to the Land of Failed Curly Hair Products. I also don't really like the smell, but it's not awful.
"
"
Made my hair smooth. Its a light weight formula, not too greasy
"
"
Love this for volumizing.  Use with the no-poo and conditioner for beautiful waves or curls.
"
"
and they really do work for managing the curly hair issues.  I use a number of products by DeVaCurl and like them all.
"
"
great for curls, but my skin on neck and ears break out after a few days of using the product. I had to stop using it.
"
"
I love this product as well as all of their other products. It's very wet so you can use it on dry hair. It doesn't build up and rinses out easily the next day. Try it, you won't be dissapointed!!
"
"
This stuff is a great addition to the arc angel. Usually hair products seem useless but this is surprisingly wonderful.
"
"
PLEASANTLY Surprised-it's difficult to find the right hair products for my hair-from shampoo to hairspray. My hair is fine or medium-I don't know which. It tangles easily & I have 2B-3A hair-loose waves and curls. I wanted something that would help bring out my curls, and this did it-I'm on hair day #2 and I air dried with some BUT NOT constant-scrunching. ALSO, I wrapped my hair in a towel-did not hand rough it with the towel just blotted a little before putting towel on top of my head and left it that way for 20 minutes before undoing towel, running less than a dime size of this through all my strands both sides, then did SOME scrunching off and on until it was dry-it wasn't constant.  My hair had/still has beautiful soft waves and curls! More so than just doing the same routine with washout conditioner only. Leave in conditioners, Curl creams, etc. only weighed down my hair with little waving or curls. I got the Light Defining DevaCurl Gel too, but I haven't yet tried it with the combo of actions I mentioned here. Right now it's not frizzy. Everyone has unique hair and water conditions, but I am SO glad I found something that gives me the natural, easy look I love. My hair is layered almost about to touch my shoulders. Hope this might help someone who is on their quest!
"
"
I bought this with the DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel and I use both products when I get out of the shower so I can't review this product alone. But combined, I really love the results. I have 3A curls and I have been searching for products that are lighter and defining. This provides some volume (I'd say a 10-15% volume increase) and my curls are defined and shiny and bouncy. I sleep in damp curls (with a satin pillowcase) with this and the gel and these products always give me good results. They aren't heavy in moisturizers but I don't need that as my hair doesn't tend to be dry but normal so these products are great because they are lightweight but they pack a punch for my curls. I am a fan of DevaCurl products now.
"
"
I used this product once & it does not work. Made my hair look & feel terribly dry. Smells horrible too & really over priced for such a horrible product. I had to wash my hair almost immediately after my hair dried & the product set in. My hair was a ball of frizz. I will NEVER again betray Shea Mousture products (they are truly the best in my hair). I decided to try this stuff as I was traveling to Florida & I read this was suppose to be good for high humidity & it is the worse product I've ever tried! Never again! Save your money! This stuff is so expensive & does not work on high porosity 3B/3C curly hair like mine. (This is the same review I left for the Deva Curl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam as I used this with the foam, the Heaven In Hair treatment, & the Set It Free finishing spray & they are all horrible!)
"
"
Please, curly girls, don't buy this product.  It made me look like I had walked through a spider web, or maybe like I dusted my china cabinet with my hair.  The first time this happened I thought I maybe used too much product, I had used some of the Devacurl Defining Gel first then added some curl boost.  I ended up being at my sons college graduation looking like I had an awful case of dandruff.  So I used it again yesterday, the curl boost alone, no other product.  It certainly made my curls feel soft, but as soon as my hair dried and I gave a random scrunch out of habit, all the dust and fluff and flickies took over.  And they stick, they don't just fall out, so my hairs looked coated in dust. It's really awful.  I hate this product.  I've used Devacurl products for years, I have 3 different curl patterns on my head, exasperated by cancer treatment, and I've loved the gel and other curl enhancers, but NOT THIS ONE! I wish I could return it...
"
"
It only takes a small drop to leave an extra moisture boost to your curls. I even use it on my hair for extra moisture when I'm going to straighten it, but when I use it on my hair to let it dry on it's own, it's very lightweight and leaves my curls looking and feeling great!
"
"
I wanted to love this so much, but it didn't seem to do too much to my fine, curly hair. I tried applying it several different ways and with different amounts...to soaking wet hair, to damp hair, plopped it, air dried, diffused. Used alone it barely did anything. When paired with other products, I couldn't tell if it was this that was working or something else. I used the entire bottle in about a month.

I've heard only good things about DevaCurl products. This one is pretty good. I have fine curly hair and it definitely gives my curls some body and volume.
"
"
I have loved all previous DEVA products I own. This leave in Conditioner is an exception.The consistence is fine and it does get rid of frizz but as it dries, It leaves your hair covered in white flakes.I had several people ask me throughout the day what happened to my hair.I do not recommend
"
"
My wife use this product . She has natural wavy hairs. This product along with it gel works best for her .Trick is to apply the product when hairs are wet and tie the hair in microfiber towel for few minutes to give them perfect curl shape.
"
"
This product has a nice scent but does nothing for my hair because my hair has enough volume on its own. It did not work for me but would be nice for someone else.
"
"
I usually love B'Leave In.  I've got really curly hair and it acts as a light humectant with a good curl keeper without feeling sticky, crunchy, or heavy.  Since it is a glycerin-based product, you might want to read up on that ingredient re: hair products.  It can be inappropriate for use in dry climates or freshly dyed hair.
"
"
I love B'Leave In for my fine curly hair.  It helps add volume without weight.  I mix it with my gel/cream and apply to wet hair before using a towel/t-shirt to dry my hair a bit.  It helps my curls.  Definitely a holy grail hair product for me.
"
"
This product leaves my hair disgustingly flakey! I really wanted to love this product, and I like how my curls look, but I do not want to walk around looking like the basket case from Breakfast Club :/
"
"
Defines my curls with just a few squirts!  Love this.  Apply to hair while still wet when styling.  Make sure to scrunch those curls!  It makes a huge difference.
"
"
it works well be careful with the amount you use because it can leave residue on hair and you have to add extra water after to prevent flakes.that my experience
"
"
Not the best product for my hair.  I am not pleased with how stiff the curls are.  Might work better for a different type of hair.
"
"
I try so many products for my 3c hair and this one is definitely on my favorite list.  I thought because it was a gel substance that it would make my hair ""crunchy"" but it did not at all.
"
"
One of the few products that I have found for my thinning wavy hair that keeps it looking nice all day.
"
"
Not crazy about it. I think it doesn't help with the frizz.
"
"
This stuff is great!  Real curl definition and cut down on the frizz.  I follow It up with a little Deva light control gel and rims a great combination.
"
"
Leaves my hair so soft and curly, without that wet look or crunchy feeling. The only reason to not give a full 5 stars is the scent; it was't the same sweet fruity scent of the curling mousse, which was what I was hoping for. This smells more botanical or ""green"" - it's not unpleasant, just not the same as their other curl products.
"
"
Doesn’t curl your hair as much as it says it will. The bottle looks different than pictured too. Probably good for hair that is already curly.
"
"
Is a great curl booster. It's not really a leave-in conditioner as far as I can tell, it's rather a leave-in curl booster and volumizer. I think it works quite well, my hair is curlier and seems fuller when I use this under my normal gel than when I use gel alone. It's great for my fine hair.
"
"
I have fine curly hair and this did mot work for me.
"
"
Good products.  Helps hair to curl with no added weight
"
"
I love this stuff! My hair is curly in the summer and wavy in the winter. In the colder months my hair definitely needs a lift due to the lack of humidity, and this provides the volume I need.  Also, it smells really wonderful!
"
"
I have to get used to it, leaves my hair a bit stiff.
"
"
This definatly plumped up my curls! I layer it on top of wavemaker, and under light defining gel. I definatly dont want to go without this product again. I have 2b/2c fine thin hair. When I use this it looks like I have twice as much hair! I'm satisfied that it is a genuine devacurl product. I use about half as much of this as I do the gel, you don't want or need a lot. This is ment to layer with other stylers as it doesn't give any hold on it's own. It's also good for taming frizz between wash days. I'm sure it's got more uses, but I havnt discovered them yet. I would recommend this to all curly types, but especially those wanting to add extra plumpness to their curls
"
"
Lightweight, doesn't weigh curls down, can be used for 2nd/3rd day curl touch ups. Perfect combo of the light hold gel and the styling cream.
"
"
I like it . It does give decent hold for my wash and go styling when mixed with gel. I need to try it alone to see what results it gives on it’s own.
"
"
I love Devacurl and this is a high quality product but not for me. It makes my fine 3a curly hair dry even with oil.
"
"
It's been ages since I've used a gel (think 1980s) and this one has brought me back.
"
"
Doesn’t work
"
"
I use mostly all DevaCurl products and this is another great product of theirs.  I have very curly thick hair and this helps define my curls.  If I use too much it will get crunchy but a little while my hair is wet and it will define and you don't know I have any product in.
"
"
Great product! It HEALED my super damaged hair. If you have flatter hair, scrunch it in right after washing for more volume.
"
"
This works well for my fine, thin, frizzy/curly hair.  I have been mixing it 1/2 and 1/2 with home made fla seed gel .  The B Leave-in adds body and the gel seems to give more definition.  Combining it also makes it less expensive.
"
"
I've used cheaper products that helped much butter, but it still makes my hair feel moisturized.
"
"
makes hair a little stiff.
"
"
This stuff is awesome.  I have curly hair, but thin and this does add some volume and spruces up the curls.  I also think it smells great.  Love all the Deva products I have purchases thus far (no poo and conditioner are also awesome, and again, smell great).  Products do not weigh down hair either.
"
"
I really wanted to love it, I had heard so many good things about it, unfortunately it just didn't work out for us.  It did help out my curls, however they felt super dry and somewhat crunchy at the beginning, after a while the moose crunchy feeling kinda fgaded but my hair looked and felt dry still.
"
"
The DevaCurl product line is fabulous.  The B'Leave-In works great for me.  I don't like the feeling that gel or hairspray leaves in my hair, but I get frizz easily without, B'Leave-In keeps the frizz away and leaves my hair soft and feeling product free at the same time!
"
"
I was very pleased with this product. It definitely added more volume to my curls. My hairdresser suggested I apply it after I apply the deva curl defining gel and then I use the microfiber towel to scrunch dry.
"
"
I LOVE this stuff
"
"
Love it! a little goes a long way. does not make your hair greasy, or crunchy like some other products tend too. this stuff is absolutely amazing!!
"
"
Hate this product. Waste of money.
"
"
Love this product for adding moisture to my hair, but need to use something else with it if I want to define my curls.
"
"
Arrived busted.. also kinda smells funny
"
"
I've used this line for several years but not this product until ordering from amazon. It works well as a light gel-like volumizer but the smell is overpowering in a noxious way.  I won't reorder.
"
"
Yeah, works well like the other Deva stuff.
"
"
Everything Devacurl makes is awesome and works great on my curls! All their products smell amazing too!
"
"
Works.
"
"
The product is good. I've used it before. However the packaging was so tight that it broke the top of the pump. I had to buy another container and transfer the product.
"
"
Best hair gel I found for my wavy/curly hair. I use very little to keep my curls defined. I don't have a lot of curls, so maybe if you have very curly hair you need to use more. For me a little of it goes a really long way. I primarily bought it because it had a very low toxicity score in the EWG Cosmetic Database, but I've been very impressed with how well it works. I've been using it for six months now, and it worked well during winter months as well as hot summer/spring months. When I ran out of it, I saw a huge difference in how my hair behaved without it (much more freeze, less definition to my curls). I don't have much of white residue left on my hair after I use it, but maybe it's because I use only a little of it.
"
"
oh, yes.  works great, lifts my curls and waves with nice feel!
"
"
I tried it by itself, but it did nothing for my hair.  I have very fine hair with a lot of curl to wave. It just made my hair flop, which was odd for a product that is supposed to create some volume.  Then I mixed it with the Angel gel, which was better.  Then I found that less of this, with the usual amount of gel was optimum.  Unfortunately, the directions don't tell you how to use it other than the usual scrunch it in. They should probably have the directions for a few different scenarios. I envy those who can just put in their hair and have it work.  I have not tried it on dry hair, or on a second day. I will buy this again.
"
"
I've been using the DevaCurl products for about a year. Then I added this and I LOVE the results. I have fine wavy/curly hair. My hair isn't as dry/frizzy. It feels great and I love the smell.
"
"
I have tried just about all their products. This one works great on my thick hair. It smells good and isn't sticky or gummy. Use it after you cleanse, condition.
"
"
Leaves my hair flat and crunchy. Blech. No returns allowed.
"
"
I love it!
"
"
Works perfectly. Best brand for curls.
"
"
Product was damage when opened the shrink wrap.  No information on how to get a replacement.
"
"
Prefect for curly hair. Soft texture.light weight. Pleasant smell.
"
"
Love Deva Curl products. This was delivered super quick!!
"
"
I love this gel! It doesn't leave my hair all crunchy but it still does what it needs to! I even bought some for my sister and she loves it too!
"
"
Perfect. Great price
"
"
Can barely tell a difference after using it.
"
"
I have extremely fine, thin, fragile hair that has a natural wave. Genetics and chronic digestive absorption issues are to blame for that!Clearly, I purchased this product hoping it would pump up my hair so I would finally have the voluptuous mane of a healthy lion. Ummm... Sad to say, I do not have the flowing mane of a healthy lion. I don't really notice any more 'volume' while using this product, but I do like that it sticks my frizzies down.One thing I like about this, that other ladies may find weird or defeating its purpose, is that is makes my wavy hair almost straight. It actually removes my waves somewhat. I have been trying to enhance my waves for a year now, but in all actuality, I prefer the straighter look of my hair when using this product. I put a dime sized amount through both halves of my DRY hair in the a.m. and then spritz lightly with water to let my hair 're-form' itself a bit after sleeping. My hair has had more movement with this than it ever has with curling gels, sprays, mousses, etc. It ends up being straight 1/3 of the way down from the roots and then the waves pick up at the ends, so it's actually kind of mermaid looking, imo. It's not crunchy feeling or looking, either, which is of utmost importance to me.However, my hair is still fine and fragile so it continues to look thin. Can't win them all!
"
"
It relaxes my hair. My hair texture is frizzy
"
"
Just want to clarify to potential future users, this product provides zero hold. I think I need to use it with the Angel/light defining gel, but that just seems like too much hair product/work
"
"
Love this stuff! Kind of pricey though!
"
"
I love all the products in this line.  Having naturally curly hair at my old age is fun as these products help alot in preserving them and making them look great.
"
"
👍
"
"
Good Stuff...I've used it for years and it's nice not to have to buy it at the salon, it's delivered to my door.
"
"
This product smells great and goes on smoothly. It provides a good curl boost, but not a strong hold. I would recommend it for those looking for a light-weight hold.
"
"
I love the ethos of this company. I love how Curl Power they and I wanted to transition into a completely natural product line. I gave the whole line the old college try and it just wasn't for me. I am a solid 3B and i found that this made my hair really greasy looking even though it didn't feel greasy to the touch. In fact the ends felt dry. I tried every possible combination or product and amount and it just wasn't working. for the people I have seen this product work really well on is girls with wavy hair that want to work it into curl. then it is great but if you already have big curls it is just too heavy and pulls it down.
"
"
Love it!  put in right out of the shower for soft shiny curls!
"
"
Great product.  I use quite a few depending on my mood, this is one of my favorites.
"
"
bueno
"
"
Smooth transaction...no problems...thanks!
"
"
I'm still trying to figure out that fine line between too much product that weighs my hair down and too little product that doesn't offer the volume I want, but all in all I like this product because it has a lack of tacky stickiness that most others have. I cannot stand that crunchy tacky feeling despite liking my ""beach curls"" to be a little more defined, and this product can allow my to have that definition, and the volume that curls can often lack because they're so heavy, while not feeling like a crunchy pine cone.
"
"
This did not boost my hair.  It seemed to weigh it down, and cause fly away frizz.
"
"
My hair absolutely LOVES this product! It has so much slip!
"
"
yup
"
"
This is great leave in curl boost and volumizer.  We love this stuff.  I will be buying more in the future.
"
"
Make your hair super curly but frizzy!
"
"
So in love with this product !
"
"
I little too sticky feeling for my liking.  it's more like a hair gel.  would prefer a nice creamy leave in conditioner
"
"
Great product, just not for me. I found it a little tacky when applying to my hair, but it gets the job done if you don't mind it.
"
"
I have used this product for a long time. Really does what says and I will keep buying it. Good product.
"
"
Love Love Love it really makes curls defined.
"
"
This has met all my expectations.  My curls love it.
"
"
Great as usual... Love this product
"
"
Best product I have ever used for my curly hair!
"
"
As advertised.
"
"
LOVE the Deva line of products!!
"

LOVE the Deva line of products!!

After watching the deva curl videos on the website I tried some of their tips and was pleasantly surprised. So i decided to try the product recommended. It was watery and didn't help my curls. I ended up throwing it away. I also purchased the arc angel gel, and while it was better, and had more hold, I've used better products.Lastly, the tube came wrapped in tape and was sticky. I had to clean the tube with goo gone just to use it.
"
"
Good stuff!
"
"
On a curl here
"
"
This really works for my curly hair. Sets the curl without leaving it crunchy.
"
"
Deva is a great product for curly hair.
"
"
Not sure if this works the way I would liked it to work. This product is very watery but drys nicely. If you shake your head once your hairs drys you will have white stuff flying in the air. If you have dark hair it actually looks dusty this this product. Great curls but your hair looks dirty. I will stay with the cream and ultra defining gel! Awesome products! This one not so much.. disappointing.
"
"
This stuff works for my hair.
"
"
I thought this would be a great replacement for VO5 Soft Spin gel, but it doesn't work for me. It flakes.
"
"
This is probably the best product of the entire Deva line. I use it for my very fine, over shoulder length hair that has loose curls. I started really loving this product in the summer; I use it after swimming in my wet hair, and it leaves my hair (after air drying) soft, shiny and touchable, with beautiful beachy waves. Just don't use too much, or else it will get sticky.
"
"
Perfect for curly hair!
"
"
This is the BEST  leave in hair product I have ever used.  I have fine curly hair and this holds the curls without any kind of stiffness at all. Even after hair drys you can run your hands through the curls and you feel no buildup or sticky residue. Definitely recommend.
"
"
Great product.
"
"
This product works great on my curly hair, helps tame the frizz. I like to use it when my hair is still wet and it really helps the curls to set without getting frizzy. Definitely recommend this product.
"
"
Great Stuff
"
"
Best DevaCurl product if your hair tends towards fine, wispy, and frizzy. This product does not weigh down my hair like some of the other Devacurl products. Used with No Poo and conditioner, love this line.
"
"
love this  a lot.
"
"
Works about as well as much cheaper products. I won't spend this much money on a curl product again.
"
"
Product is great. Seller is not.
"
"
I have 2b fine hair and nothing has worked for me in place of this product. I no poo, squeeze out excess water, put in, let sit for a minute.  Scrunch with micro fiber towel, put in LA mega hold (deva defining gel doesn't work for me...)  plop while putting I'm make up, difuse slightly and let air dry until I can crunch out the gel set.  I have researched and tried everything but so far, 3 months in to CG products and no poo, for fine. Highlighted 2b hair, this is what works for me.
"
"
I love all of the Deva products.  This one helps to keep the frizz down.  I use it regularly and will re-order it when I get low.
"
"
Wonderful product 👏👏👏👏
"
"
I love this product and it arrived on time! Great!
"
"
I like this conditioner especially on the first day I use it but it does not seem to do much if you do not reapply it on the second day. I do not need more volume in my hair and maybe that is why I prefer Heaven in the Hair and the conditioner to this.
"
"
Love it
"
"
Love the product
"
"
I love this stuff! It controls my curls and leaves them soft and bouncy with definition
"
"
I especially don't like the way my hair feels the next day and so the basically full tube just sits there.
"
"
this item is great for curly hair, it leaves hair soft and smelling great, not all stiff like some products, I highly recommend for people with curly hair! finally a product for us!
"
"
I am so glad I found the Deva Curl products!!!! It has made my life of curls so much easier and much more enjoyable!!! This gel is the best on the market for curly hair, and I absolutely love ALL Deva Curls products!!!!
"
"
Good for more defined curls
"
"
Love the product. Been using for years
"
"
This works very well.  I have tight curls and this gives me fuller curls.  Don't use a lot, i feel when i do it tends to dry out my hair.  Just a little, it is such a silky liquid, you really do not need alot.
"
"
This was just one of 4 items i purchased from the DevaCurl line. This product and the conditioner that I had purchased both have a horrible smell. It's so weird because the Lowpoo and the AnGel both smell fresh and fruity. The conditioner and curl boost both leave your hair smelling like you dunked your head in a bucket of Pine Sol. That's not an appealing smell and it stays with you until you wash your hair again. I can't even use the products. The smell is too much! I'm going to be ordering Ouidad next time. At least I know that I won't smell like a floor mop!
"
"
This product is supposed to boost and volumize curls that are more on the thin side.  Unfortunately for me the ""volume"" came in the form of frizz.  I tried this product many times using differing amounts with the same results.  This is not a product I can recommend.
"
"
Excelent product for curly eavy hair, it is not my favorite from deva curls , it leaves my hair curilier than what I like and crunchy. the product is excellent but I liked the get and moose better
"
"
This is a good leave in that defines curls and waves. It's a bit lacking in the moisture department, but it provides decent frizz control and won't weigh your hair down.  It contains a large amount of glycerin, a powerful humectant, so it's better for use during the warmer seasons.  On the whole, I like this product and would recommend it to others, but I will keep searching to see if I can find an even better alternative.
"
"
I have spent millions on curly hair product with nothing really doing the trick.  This stuff is ok but doesn't hold very well.
"
"
Leaves my hair very very flaky. I've barely used it as a result. It feels more like gel than a leave-in conditioner.
"
"
I like this product because it is less expensive than the Aveda product I usually use.
"
"
Leaves hair feeling dry.  Doesn't seem to increase curls volume.
"
"
Still waiting for it to work.
"
"
Works pretty good.  Leaves hair rejuvinated and soft.
"
"
I really like the smell and that you can curl your hair the way you want it to. It is easy and simple, your hair won't feel hard or dry afterwards. It is doing its job.
"
"
Excellent!
"
"
I have very fine 2a hair that can go either way. I was using ArcAngel before discovering this little beaut. This stuff is amazing! Doesn't weigh my hair down & adds defining curls & volume. Does not leave a sticky film or harden hair. The texture is very silky. I can even use this on my second day without washing, just slightly wet hair and add B'Leave-In & curls are even more gorgeous than on a wash day. I use the no poo and one condition on wash days and use ONLY this when scrunching hair. This one is a keeper, only product I need to define my curls!
"
"
Not what I expected
"
"
I used to straighten out my fine curly hair every day - never able to make peace with my curls because they were dry and unruly. I've been using DevaCurl products for about 6 months, and B'Leave-In is a key part of the process that works for me. I use it on WET hair straight out of the shower, before using Arc-Angell. I did have to play with the line a little before my hair figured out how to respond to it, but now I can say I've never loved my curls this much in my life. If your hair is dry, B'Leave-In will make the difference without weighing down. But I think you really have to use it with the rest of the line, or it won't make much sense...
"
"
Have wavy or curly hair?  Buy this...  I have tried EVERY Aveda product & this is SO much better!  I even tried curl confidence, that was 3x as much & NO GOOD! B'Leave in is not sticky, not crunchy, it beats the frizz & really makes my hair curlier. I need to be able to run my fingers through my hair & this product even allows me to comb it (wide tooth) with no frizz.  I use it wet after a rinse or wash & then after it's dried for more curl activation.  LOVE IT!!!
"
"
Bought it with confidence thinking that it would work... When I used it, my hair started flaking(after it settled) as if I used a super cheap product. I just emailed them... Its not a product I would reccomend to anyone!
"
"
Great product--although pricey
"
"
too frizzy, too uptight curly,  too bad.It turned out like a cheap perm, a home perm that was too scrunched instead of shiny, loose curls.
"
"
it's true what others have said, it flakes in your hair once it dries. it's non-crunchy, but it does not moisturize your hair either. Waste of money
"
