"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","This product seemed thinner that normal to me.  So I went to an Ulta (certified distributor for Deva Curl) and bought the same product, and it is way, way thicker.  The squirt of the product I bought at Ulta retained it's shape as squirted and the Amazon product puddled.  We could tell the difference when rubbing it between our fingers.  There was 4 of us.  We all agreed, the Amazon product is watered down!  Don't buy this!  I will never buy a Deva product from Amazon will again.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","This is not the legit product. I have been using Deva Curl One Condition for years and this bottle's contents both smelled different and had a thicker consistency than the real stuff. This stuff has a consistency that of a thick body butter, not of Deva Curl One Condition conditioner. It's so thick that you need to use twice as much and rub it around in your hands to even get it to spread into your hair. It's awful. I also know it's not right because my hair isn't conditioned at all once I rinse it out. And you have to rinse it FOREVER to get it all out or it will leave a residue leaving your hair crunchy and gross. Find out who's providing you this product, Amazon, and take them to task. They are selling you fake One Condition.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","I am a huge fan of DevaCurl products. I have been using DevaCurl for over a year now. It works well for both my long hair and short hair.I started with their travel size of the ""DevaCurl Kit for All Curl Kind"" It includes 3oz bottles of  No-Poo Original, One Condition Original, Styling Cream, Light Defining Gel.I was really shocked at how well this line of products worked on my hair. I buy all of them in the large bottles now. Individually they are good products but together they have changed my curls. I am not kidding at all! My curls are curlier, not crunch, not as frizzy and overall more beautiful than before I used DevaCurl.

I want to start by saying I'm a big fan of this conditioner. I love, love the results I've gotten from it & how soft it's made my hair. I have to agree with other posts that ""THIS"" bottle of conditioner is a little thinner. I compared the old bottle with this & there is definitely a difference. I notice I'm having to use more conditioner now & my hair isn't as soft. It does seem watered down. I would not buy this product from this seller again just because of this, but I would def buy this conditioner again. I will go back to the first seller. I was looking for a cheaper price & I guess you get what you pay for.

Just received this conditioner and it's the daily creme conditioner, not the ultra creamy that is in the photo.  It's still good conditioner but the ultra creamy is much thicker and coats better.  It's possible that Deva does not offer the ultra creamy version anymore since it's getting more difficult to find, but then the new bottle should also be shown in the photo.

This product seems like it was tampered with and laundry detergent was added to it. It smells like it too. It is so liquidy and doesn't feel like conditioner. After the first time, it appeared to have stripped my hair color. I gave it another try and it is a failure. I am so disappointed and do not recommend this product.

I am a mixed race female with somewhat loose curls. I would say this is a ""decent"" hair product but you could do much better for half the price. I've tried Paul Mitchell, biolage, mixed chicks, redkin, and various other ""pricey"" brands. Deva curl definitely ranks 2nd or 3rd. Cantu and other ""natural"" hair products definitely work better for half the price ! Save your money and shop elsewhere ! Or invest in some Moroccan oil (that stuff is worth the money in my opinion) !

Let’s be honest, devacurl is expensive. Like everyone else on here I was weary of purchasing through amazon because of the warnings in the reviews. So I’ll just keep it real for the first time devacurl users and the long time ones, it’s a little lengthy but I hope it helps:1. For the long time users, keep in mind some of these reviewers are deva certified and get paid to sell devacurl products. I wouldn’t be surprised if half of these “DO NOT BUY. MADE ME HAIR HORRIBLE. KNOCK OFF” reviewers are just upset they’re losing sales. I’ve purchased the styling cream for $14 on here (which is what it SHOULD cost) and I honestly don’t have many complaints. The smell was great. However I DID notice 2 things about this conditioner. The product packaging looked like it slightly spilled which means it could’ve possibly been tampered with. And the product consistency was a little more watered down than original (I compared it with a 3oz $10 devacurl cream conditioner I purchased from ulta on my hand). I also let it sit on my hand, the one from ulta was thicker and took longer to dry than the one I purchased on here.  Probably explains why when I parted my hair on wash day, the side I used the amazon conditioner left my hair slightly dryer than the side I where used the conditioner from ulta. So I do agree that this is not 100%authentic. Still, it did not harm my hair and did leave it smelling great overall which is what I honestly use it for. You’re just getting what you pay for I guess.2. For the first time devacurl users, as mentioned, I honestly only use devacurl for special occasions for the SMELL. This product is way to overpriced and rips off natural haired girls. I use it sparingly when I am heading out. There’s much better options for much more reasonable prices if you want quality care. And I am all about quality, but high prices doesn’t always mean good quality it’s just name brand you’re buying. And that’s what devacurl is, name brand. Not bad but not the best for your money’s worth. Quality products would be Mielle Organics (my favorite), Nutrahair Cachos (got it from a Brazilian friend and LOVED it), Naturallclub deep conditioner (my friend swears by it) even the DIY. There’s also Curlmix and bellebar that gets great reviews.The take away? I have low porosity 4a (some 3c) curls. My hair actually prefers watered down products even though it’s thicker/tighter curled, which is why I use original conditioner from devacurl. However this particular product? Too watered down I prefer the real conditioner. Again, I’ve purchased the styling cream with no problem from amazon for almost half the price and had no problems, packaging was even perfect, just not this conditioner. Do not let some of these devacurl stylist deter you away from saving you some $$ on amazon. They get paid off of this stuff. Obviously it works for some other purchasers so it’s not THAT bad. Personally it left my hair a little dryer due to whatever they added which I don’t trust it and probably not worth buying even at $14 anyway. Just because this was my experience doesn’t mean it won’t be the same for you. I’m just sticking to regular sulfate free shampoos and conditioners, it’s honestly what you LEAVE IN your hair or DEEP CONDITION with that actually matters!!! Devacurl as a whole company wouldn’t get more than 3 stars from me, they’re lucky it smells great. I did not like the packaging which is why I’m giving it 2 stars. I’ll probably only use and purchase the styling cream from devacurl from now on.Hope this helps!!!

This isn't the real product. I've been using Deva for years and when I first recieved this, the smell wasn't right - it smelled like cheap hand lotion. It didn't feel right on my hair either, the consistency. I continued using it, and my curls started drying out and falling flat, my hair was breaking, etc. So I took the bottle in to a Sephora to compare the scent and consistency with an in-store product, and they WERE NOT THE SAME. I'd recommend buying straight from a salon or the like before you totally destroy your curls.

I got lucky! After reading the reviews I was really worried about getting a knock off.  As soon as I received it, I opened it to make sure that it had a thick creamy texture and a light lemon scent and it does! So it’s got to be the real thing. I have used this 4 days in a row now, and I really like it! I have really long thick hair, mostly wavy but sometimes curly.  So far I have noticed that my hair feels softer, and less frizzy which is really what I wanted to go for. As for volume, since my hair already has natural volume I haven’t really noticed a difference with that.  I can’t wait to receive the “shampoo” part of this. So far I just been using this conditioner.

This is by far the best curly hair product line I have ever used.  Years ago I used a L'Oréal line.  Then I used an Aveda line.A friend suggested deva curl.  She said it would be life changing and she was so right.  My hair has never looked better!  My daughter uses it too and it is amazing how much better her hair looks and feels.  I wish I would have known about deva when she was little because it is an amazing detangler.Take 3 minutes to watch a you tube video on how to use the products!  With simple techniques shown in the videos, you can learn to wash your hair and  let it air dry and have a great hair day!

DO NOT BUY. Fake product. I’ve bought Devacurl before from amazon as a set shampoo and conditioner, it was legit. I needed to re-up and got this. This is ABSOLUTELY another product with DC packaging.On arrival the pump head had been sprung already, bad sign #1. The conditioner is shiny and much more watery than the real deal. It smells like suave. I thought okay maybe they changed something, trying to not be suspicious because this is sold from Devacurl directly- or that’s how it seems. I rinsed and got out of the shower, I had to re-rinse because my hair was full of suds still. The true product DOES NOT LATHER THERE SHOULDN'T BE SUDS. Currently less than 10 minutes after a shower and my scalp is on fire. RUN from this product. Don’t test your luck, don’t be me and not check the reviews.

I have been using Deva Curl products since 2006 with great results. Low-Poo, No-Poo and One Condition have been my go to. The company has been sold 3 times since then and apparently has added some toxic chemistry to their products. In the last several years, I have noticed severe hair loss at my scalp and my hairline. My hair used to be so thick that hairdressers joked that they'd have to sharpen their scissors after my haircut. My hair is now so thin, I can see my head and my curls don't last beyond the first day and turn into fuzz and frizz where there used to be curls. My hair used to be healthy and grew fast. I haven't had a haircut in 3 years and my hair does not seem to be growing. My diet is excellent and I feel fine. This product sucks and has damaged my hair and a whole community of former DevaCurl users. There are a few Facebook groups with horrible stories of what's happening to them because of DevaCurl's products. One group has over 11,000 members

I learned of this product by going to a Devacurl hair specialist. The specialist taught me what products to use and how to use them properly on my hair. I have to say it is a process but well worth it. Since I've used this product, my hair has come back to life. I always get compliments for my hair and that it smells so good! Love it! You need to know what your curl type is whether you have wavy, curly or super curly hair. This product runs by three different types of curls which are, wavy (light green bottle lid), curly (green bottle lid) and super curly (teal bottle lid). My curl type is curly so I purchased the (Green bottle lid).Process: While in the shower I used my No-Poo(Green bottle lid) and massaged my scalp and crunched it at the same time. When rinsing my hair I allow the No-Poo run down to the tip of my hair until you rinse completely. I then use the Devacurl Conditioner (which I was delivered the wrong bottle, Teal bottle lid for super curly but I didn't bother to return it because I really needed a conditioner for my hair which is why I gave it the 4 stars) and massaged the scalp. As I began to rinse my hair I allowed the conditioner run down to the tip of my hair and began to run my fingers through my hair for any tangles. (You can use a wide-tooth brush for the stubborn tangles but only while you are in the shower with conditioner on your hair!) You can leave some conditioner on your hair when your rinsing. When done with rinsing, lean your hair over, begin to use the Devacurl gel and begin to crunch your hair. Then get a microfiber towel and continue to crunch the hair. (I recommended you to NOT wrap the towel on your hair to dry!!) It's best to crunch as it stops dripping wet.  As you use the towel your hair begins to dry. Please use a MICROFIBER TOWEL!! It helps with frizz control. I purchased one on amazon and it's amazing! I then used curl clips (Bought from Amazon) while my hair air dries and get myself  ready to allow some volume when I get ready to defuse my hair. When I'm ready to defuse my hair I first remove the hair clips and use the Devacurl defuser which I love!. Totally recommend and begin to defuse your hair. After getting used to the process it will get easier for you.  I still want to try more products from Devacurl and when I do I will let you know my results. When this package was delivered it was also spilling. However, delivery like always was fast. Hopefully next time I get the right bottle for my hair type but so far so good!!

This bottle of Deva Curl One Conditioner is not authentic. I have used this conditioner for years and I have a bottle that I bought at the salon to compare it with. It smells and feels differently than the original.It smells like the no poo not the conditioner.I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with this product and would not buy it again from this seller.

I have baby fine curly hair and this stuff is too heavy for me, and just makes my hair greasy.My sister has thick curly hair and swears by this stuff. She lets her hair air dry and it always looks like she just came from the salon. A little goes a long way and you'd only need a pump, maybe 2 to get the job done so this is lasting her well over 2 months  (which is when she would usually be running out)

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
This stuff is amazing for my hair. Like people can actually tell when I am not using devacurl because of how bad and frizzy my hair gets with other products. I use the no poor cleanser, the conditioner, styling cream and the foam. It works wonders on my hair!The first picture was with me using 'curly hair' products there was some curl to it but some areas just didnt want to curl and did not leave my hair moisturized. The second picture is after a few days of washing it the color shines and it looks so healthy. I absolutely love this stuff. And will always budget out money for it because it works!

I know a lot of people who are dedicated to Deva Curl so I wanted to give the line a try. I'm not sure if this product is counterfeit, but it did not do for me what I thought it would. It felt nice going in my hair in the shower, but the smell was very strong and very synthetic-smelling. I do think it might have supported and enhanced my waves, but after 2 uses my scalp was unbearably itchy all day.  I bought a new shower filter because I thought the minerals in my water were to blame, but when I experimented with the Deva again my scalp was again itchy. I can't use this product. I'm not sure if it is counterfeit or because my hair doesn't agree with Deva. I know that there are rumors and claims around that Deva changed their formula and it's causing people to lose their hair, and I kind of believe it. Also, it didn't even particularly make my hair feel very soft and hydrated. I've used tons of different product, and this one was a dud.

I had used the devacurl line before when I wasn’t too interested in getting my natural curls back - i just wanted some good products that could manage my heat damaged curls during my tropical vacation. I wasn’t too fond of the smell either. Now that I’m a “curly girl”, I absolutely love the smell of this product. And now that I’ve learned how I should apply products to my coarse, thin hair, I love the product even more. Application is not and should not be the same for everyone. It makes a huge difference on how the product will perform. And now that I know how to apply this product to my hair, I think it performs fantastically. I love this product now and it will become part of my regulars.

This. Stuff. Does. Nothing. I am so disappointed. After watching countless YouTube videos and reading reviews of everyone raving about this product I really wanted to try it but put off doing so because of the price. After years, I finally decided to treat myself and make the purchase. The scent is so strong and overpowering. When it’s air drying I get whiffs of it every time a turn my head and then all I can think about is how strong it smells. This is never usually an issue with products for me. Secondly, it does absolutely nothing. I really thought this stuff we be my holy grail. Where is all of that moisture everyone raved about? The slip? It’s the only product in my hair right now and feels greasy. It’s as if it won’t absorb. I know this conditioner doesn’t contain silicones but it feels like it IS a silicone. I didn’t want to believe the negative reviews because I seen so many positives. Maybe they weren’t using it correctly. Maybe they are false reviews fabricated by competitors. But, I’ve used it multiple times by now and it hasn’t failed to disappoint. It’s worth a try so that you can see for yourself. Apparently people have different results, but don’t get your hopes up too high.

I first encountered this DevaCurl One Condition conditioner at Target. I fell in love with it after the first try. I felt like it hydrated my strands all the way to the inner layers of my hair, which then prevented my hair from frizzing. If you have dry, curly, or wavy hair, a moisturizing conditioner is what you will need to eliminate frizz. Not only did this conditioner get rid of the frizz,  it made my hair manageable too. I'm used to spending lots of time detangling my hair and this conditioner totally saved me the extra step. And the best part is I always had a nice hair day after using this. After I ran out, I naturally wanted to buy another bottle. Unfortunately, Target no longer sold it, so Amazon was the next best option. HUGE MISTAKE. The thing about Amazon is they sell everything. But another thing about Amazon is they don't vet their vendors. I believe I bought a heavily diluted DevaCurl One Condition conditioner from a vendor on Amazon. How do I know? The conditioner I bought from Amazon felt like water. It wasn't thick like the one I had previously used and it took me many, many pumps just to coat my hair. And worst of all, it did not give my hair the same great results as previously described. The seller I bought from is PHARMAPACKS. Just make a purchase at your own discretion if you choose Amazon. Otherwise, just buy straight from the company that makes it. There's no point in saving a few extra bucks with a sketchy seller when you don't even get the same great results.

This is not the original product. For years of using the actual original (while cap, old green label like in the photo) - I loved it and everything was great. Now, they advertise as ""original"" but ship the new version (green cap, mostly white label), and it gives me a reaction in the shower every time. And I can't even return it because the bottle busted in shipping. Very disappointed, DevaCurl, disappointed and saddened.

I've used this product for years. I used to have dry curly hair but with continued use of this product, it's not dry anymore. I wash my hair 2x week with the no-poo and use this in the shower every day. I buy it in the 32 oz container because it's so much cheaper.Now, on to Amazon. I ordered the 32 oz and received the 12 oz. I contacted Amazon to tell them of the mistake and I was told they were out of stock of the 32 oz. So, first of all, the site doesn't say they are out of stock. They then took my money and sent me a smaller size without notifying me that they were out of stock. Did Amazon think I wouldn't notice the difference in size - and price??? I'm disappointed in Amazon.

My hair is wavy/curly, thin, dry, frizzy. I used Pantene shampoo and conditioner until I stumbled upon a “miracle” DevaCurl no poo cleanser and One conditioner. I was hoping to get rid of frizz and make my hair healthier. I’ve been using DevaCurl no poo and their one conditioner for about 3 weeks now, twice a week. My hair seems to be even drier and frizzier then ever before. I also noticed it gets tangled very easily and is very coarse to touch.  It is a mess, I am going back to regular shampoo and conditioner.

The only brand I trust with my crazy curly hair! Before using DevaCurl my hair was dry, frizzy and life less! Now my hair has nice soft bouncy curls. My one trick is after I slightly towel dry my hair, I add conditioner to my ends (not touching the roots) and leave it in. Then I scrunch up hair with a paper towel or two. I never use a hair dryer or a brush! I just take the conditioner in my hands and using my fingers as a brush, I run it through my hair. Also my hair is now past my shoulders and I could never let it pass my shoulders in the past because I would always get nots near my neck in the back of my head. I have been using DevaCurl for about 2 years now. I highly recommend this product for those who struggle with curly hair or wavy hair!

Seems as though there are mixed reviews regarding this Deva Curl Conditioner... you either love it or wish that you spent your money elsewhere. I’m in the love it category. I gravitate towards lighter hair products because I do not have extremely textured, treated, or damaged hair. This conditioner is light, curl defining, and easy to ‘squish’ deep into the shaft (some conditioners don’t seem to want to sink in).The only thing that I would change is the scent. It’s not a foul or offensive smell, but I don’t find it to be particularly feminine or alluring. But maybe it’s not supposed to be.That said, I want it as part of my arsenal.

--If this review helped you, please click ""helpful""--Deva Curl has yet to disappoint me! I have so many of the after-shower products but just recently purchased this. I love it! It really makes a difference (which I didn't think it would) in my curls on wash day. My wash days are so much better than they used to be. I used to dread them and plan my life accordingly but I don't have to do that with this shampoo and conditioner. I do follow with all DC products and my curls love it! They're looking better than ever!--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--

I keep coming back to this to maintain my fine 3b/c natural curls.  Strangely enough I can also use this on my daughter who has straight fine hair and it makes her hair look great as well.  I love the smell, how it doesn't cause heavy build up and I couple this with the Deva Curl ultra defining gel and giovanni direct leave in conditioner which I apply before the gel.  I use a wet brush or Denman brush to gently comb the product through my hair, then shake while holding the ends and lightly scrunch my curls to form them.  It's a great routine for me.

I ordered this product that I’ve been using for years and am 99.99% certain they cut the product with something else. It smelled different and had a thinner consistency. I got a terrible rash on my scalp from this. I use One Condition religiously and have never had this reaction. I won’t prefer from this vendor ever again

I am an older woman with long, still healthy, thick hair. My hair dresser recommended these products to me several years ago, and I have used nothing else since. It doesn't strip your hair like most shampoos, and the conditioner can be left in if desired. You can ""scrunch"" your wet hair with this product and the curls stay until next shampoo. I love the fragrance, also!

This my favorite conditioner.  I use it not only to condition my hair after washing it, but also use it to style my hair.  It detangles well, and it doesn't flake when used with other products.  I wash with Deva No-Poo and i get wonderful results from both.  They leave my hair soft and manageable.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I was fed up with my normal products still allowing my curls to get frizzy, so I finally tried this No Poo products. I wish I had switched YEARS ago. I have fine, thick Caucasian curls and it doesn't weigh my hair down or make it greasy like a lot of curl products can since they tend to be really heavy products. I use the No Poo cleanser, conditioner and coconut hair cream and my hair is FANTASTIC, especially on the second or third day. When needed, I wash with an dandruff shampoo but otherwise I stick to this and will always do so.

Here's a pic of the leaky/damaged pump I received today.  The conditioner was all over the bubble wrap, too.  And now I can't get the pump to work.  I REALLY want the pump to work.  I'd return/exchange it, but I really need it.  I love the product and have used nothing else for months.  What I really want is a new pump, but I can't figure out how to contact the seller, so I'm posting it here.  Of course, getting a new pump or not will play into how I purchases this product next time.

Okay so I was nervous about this cause I read that some people ended up with watered down or knockoff products when they ordered this. My seller was Truemark, and the product that I received appears to be an authentic. The bottle is right and the texture is right, not watery and not too thick. The ingredient list matches the current ingredient list that’s on the official DevaCurl website. See photos if you wanna compare yourself! Point is, this seller is a good one. Make sure to check the seller when buying it!

I was sent a fake product! The product was sent from Amazon Services LLC and it is not Deva Curl conditioner. I have an almost empty bottle of the real stuff in my shower and when I opened this new bottle It was so evident that it was fake. It smelled nothing like the original. It smelled like lemon pledge and did not moisturize at all. It was hotel conditioner quality garbage and I’m super disappointed. I’m definitely sending it back for a refund

I used to use this and loved it. Unfortunately, smelled like I was giving myself a perm just now. (My hairdressers continually say it’s natural.) So I checked the ingredients and Behentrimonium Chloride? Come on, Devacurl. Step up your ingredients. And that isn’t the only one. Not using this on a semi regular basis. Not healthy.However, if you don’t care about something being healthy and do care very much about your hair style.... this product gives you beautiful, luscious, piecy curls.

I’ve used this product for three years. When it seemed my hair was thinning, I stopped using it, unsure of the cause. After a year off Deva products my hair started thickening up again.

I’ve used Deva Curl One Condition for years. I noticed a few months ago that the bottle I purchased had a very strong smell, but thought it was just me. It was also thinner. I got through the bottle and didn’t think much about it. I haven’t noticed any differences from the real thing with the last couple bottles, but after watching the Broken (Netflix docu-series) episode on counterfeit cosmetics... I’m genuinely concerned. I was under the misconception that buying from the “Amazon Recommended” vendor guaranteed legitimacy. I will only be buying from stores that I trust and will NEVER buy any cosmetic on Amazon again. I say that as an environmental engineer, who is knowledgeable about exposure to toxins and carcinogens.

This is the most expensive personal care system I have ever purchased!I used Deva Curl Low Poo, One Conditioner and the Ultra Defining Gel in my morning shower.  During the day I started to feel itchy.Three hours before my flight the following morning I got out of bed to find my face swollen and blaze red.  I had a rash from head to toe!Allergic Contact Dermatitis!  WooHoo.  Lucky me!!!  NO this has NEVER happened to me before.To avoid a possible medical emergency on my 7 hour flight it was determined that my vacation should be cancelled - airfare, rental car, hotels etc.Instead of jetting off to vacation land I spent my morning in the ER to be a grateful recipient of a steroid shot.The week of vacation time was spent alternately trying to scratch off the top layer of skin and slathering on lotion to combat the itch.I think I can safely say that this product will never enter my home again.

Nothing works better for my 3B curly hair.  I find it works best when hair is completely saturated with water, really water-logged, before applying.  Then I seal it with the DevaCurl Ultra Defining gel.  For a pickup later, I have a spray bottle of water with some of the OneCondition Decadence in it; a quick shake and spray redfines curls and tames frizz. But if it's your first time trying to ""get your curl on,"" get yourself to a Deva-certified stylist to get a cut and tutorial on how to use this stuff.  It will change your relationship with your curls!

I was apprehensive to buy this conditioner; it's a lot more than I usually pay and I didn't think conditioner could make much of a difference. Boy was I wrong! Not only does it make my hair look better and feel healthier, but I also don't use nearly as much as I do when I was using cheaper conditioner. It only takes two pumps to fully condition my hair, and because of that, I think it might even be cheaper than using a lower quality conditioner to get similar results.

I love the product but the distributor needed to tighten the lid and ensure it wouldn't loosen in transit. The conditioner did come in a sealed plastic bag, but the lid was quite loose and a couple ounces of the product leaked into the bag. I couldn't salvage what spilled and was sad to lose the conditioner. (This is pricey stuff that I didn't want to waste.) When I removed the bottle from the bag, I was surprised by how loose the lid was. I've received similar products intact because the distributor tightened and taped the lid into place.

Normally this product gets a 5 star but because it came damaged in the package I gave it a 4 star.  I just wish the supplier would have shipped a replacement at no charge, and they even made me return the damaged one.  Normally they tell you to just throw it away.  Super product for frizzy curly hair.  Love it and have been using it for years.

I cant say enough, i am in LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT!!! My curls came back, ive been hearing about this product, but hesitated due to the costs.

Ehhhh I am not to crazy about the smell but it goes away after awhile.

It is not the same as I used before.  I suspect it is authentic.  I used this more conditioner than I did before.  My hair is not as curly as it used to be.  It gets more frizzle.  I used the other containers for traveling. There are conditioner, No Poo, etc in the package.  They made my hair shinier, curlier, and cleaner than this I just bought.

I love this conditioner and I leave it in to keep my curls soft and moisturized.  I LIVE the fresh scent too!  I add it to my washed hair, keeping it super wet.  I use 4-5 pumps on my hand and use my fingers to comb out any tangles and then add more, another 4-5 pumps and scrunch up my curls, while still in the shower.  My hair is still very wet but water helps your curls!  I wrap my hair loosely in a towel, squeeze my ends with the towel and then continue to squeeze my curls with just my hands.  I have long hair, just past my bra line.  I use a little mousse to keep away the frizz and my curls look awesome!

I don't feel this product is worth the price. My hair is dull after using this and it does not enhance the curl. The newer lemongrass scent is better than this original scent. Overall not impressed with this product, especially for the price. I like to buy cruelty free, vegan products but won't be using this one.

I have tried oh so many shampoo and conditioner combinations for my curly hair and most either frizz it out because there is not enough moisture or weigh down the curls because they leave a residue. I have found that this does neither and is a great conditioner for curly hair. I use it every other day and it keeps my curls moisturized. It has a very light and pleasant smell and does not leave a residue to weigh down your curls. I have noticed that my curls are much more natural looking since using this conditioner. I use it with the Deva Curl shampoo which is a low sudsing shampoo. They do work very well together. I feel this is well worth the money.

I’ve used DevaCurl products for a few years now and won’t use anything else. I know they say you have to buy it in a salon for it to be the real deal, but I haven’t had any problems at all. I buy online when I can’t find it in large bottles at my local DevaCurl salon and this appears to be an identical product.

I started using this product when I started doing the curly girl method.  I've tried a few other conditioners since, but keep coming back to the Deva One-C because of the slip.  I like how it makes my hair feel super smooth.  It is a little on the thin side, however. It never seems to coat my ends well enough.  I'm still searching for the ""perfect"" conditioner. For me and my 3B hair, that would be something super thick, super moisturizing, a little protein, and a LOT of slip. I do a lot of finger combing in the shower, so I like a product that will reduce friction as much as possible.  Since giving up silicones, I've not found anything that fits the bill perfectly (I used Infusium-23 before the curly girl switch, which I loved).  It's also a little pricey for how much I have to use.  It smells really nice, though.  Kind of spicey in a weird way.  So far, Deva One Condition is the best silicone-free conditioner I've found, but still not what is perfect for me.

The product did not smell right, or condition my hair. I have used this product line for many years and know what to expect. The sellers were not responsive to my complaint.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I have very fine, curly hair and most products either weigh down my hair so much it has trouble keeping its curl or dry it out so much it gets frizzy. Before DevaCurl I had the most luck with Redken Fresh Curl shampoo, conditioner and curl boost spray as well as L'Oreal Leave-In Conditioner for curls, but even that combo would dry it out a bit too much.My stylist recommended the DevaCurl product line & I am so grateful. It is very moisturizing without being heavy & even the most frizz-prone bits of my hair have spiraled into perfect curls. I tried using some DevaCurl combined with the above-mentioned other brand products I already used & that was an improvement, but once I switched to exclusively DevaCurl stuff every aspect of my hair & curls improved. No, Deva Concepts does not pay me. :)Seriously, this stuff works wonders! My curls are very happy with me now.

So when the company said it was the same formula with new packaging... well, that's a flat-out lie. The scent is now awful (I'm allergic... this is going to be a fun day), the consistency is thinner, and there's way less glycerin. I have an old bottle and the ingredient list has completely changed. Great. This was the only thing I've found that made my curls look decent. I even checked to see if maybe one of the other two new formulas was closer to the old formula, no dice.

DevaCurl is easily the BEST line of hair products I have ever purchased in my adult life.  I have ethnically-mixed curly hair of multiple colors, curls and textures.  I've been through Redken, Mixed Chicks, Miss Jessie's, BioSilk, MoroccanOil, Pantene, Motions, and who knows what else, but I honestly don't think I've ever been happier.Even after the first wash, my curls had more structure, bounce and vitality, and the ends are no longer brittle and dry.  My goodness, there was even SHINE.  I have less frizz and my head no longer smells like a salon.I used this conditioner in combination with the Heaven in Hair Moisture treatment and the No-Poo Shampoo for my current results.

I’m sure the product is as expected but the packaging?! Surely lost several ounces of expensive product already without even opening it.

Disappointed! Although this smells just like the salon product, this is not the same consistency. It is very much a watered down version.

Not sure what the deal is with this seller? The conditioner bottle I received must be a second from the factory because A) it had a devacurl no poo shampoo label on it, and B) although it was conditioner inside, it was NOT the original devacurl scented conditioner.  Honestly not sure which conditioner it was? It has a minty/rose smell.  It does work like devacurl conditioner though so I did keep it.

I love this conditioner! It has excellent slip and is still lightweight. I have 2c/3a hair, I don't like anything that weighs it down but I also need a lot of moisture and hydration. This conditioner is the perfect balance. Seriously a holy grail curly product. Also, the large bottle lasts forever so its worth every penny.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I cannot say enough about this product! My hair has never looked as good. My curls are soft and tighter than ever before! Not to mention it lasts all day without getting frizzy, I haven't used a hair tie in weeks.I use the conditioner every day like shampoo, making sure to scrub my scalp and really work it into the ends. I then rinse, but not completely. I use the ""no-poo"" once a week. I use the gel when my hair is sopping wet and then again after it has hair dried a bit, just to make sure the ends are covered.I will never go back to another product. Nor will I ever have to waste money again for products that don't work.

I have short naturally curly hair.  I quite like this conditioner as it is both thin and light while providing ample conditioning.  I have not had good results using it as an after product for control, with or without the Angel Gel.  It does cause your curls to 'behave' a bit differently and for the most part I like that although I think it might work better on longer hair rather than short.  I find my curls are  more defined and as a result a bit 'heavier' so overall my hair appears flatter.  I have tried using clips as recommended to lift the curls as they dry but have not had great success in creating more volume.  Once my hair dries I have found it frizzes if you manipulate your hair at all.

I have been using Deva Curl conditioner on ny kids hair for a little over a year.  From the salon and from amazon.  My recent order was not the same as the salon.

I have really long, really curly hair and i've always had a problem finding a product that worked well with my hair type. Either it was too light and my hair would be frizzy all day, or it would be too heavy and would weigh my hair down making it look greasy. I think i finally found one in the middle :)the devacurl works really well holding my curls all day, i use it as a conditioner but also leave a little in and let it air dry. finally a good hair day! And it smells really nice too. i would highly recommend the DevaCurl Conditioner for women with thick curly hair and its not pricy either. i gave it four stars because it does seem a little watered down therefore i have to use a lot of it so im probably gonna run out soon. but i'll definitely be buying this again. and again.

I've been using Deva Curl One Condition for a little over 2 years now. I love the stuff. Its a bit pricey, but a bottle this size can last me about 4-6 months (but I have fine hair thats just past my shoulders, so I don't need to use a lot at a time) If you're new to the Deva Curl method of conditioner-washing your hair it may take some getting used to, but once you get it right, you'll love it. And your hair will love it.The scent isn't strong or overpowering at all, which I really like. And its not really thick and goopy, so it rinces out of your hair cleanly. I love this stuff. I've tried other conditioners and always come back to Deva. And I like that its up to $8 cheaper on Amazon!

if you have curly hair, embrace it. i have tried probably hundreds of products marketed for curly hair over the years with no great results. until i found deva concepts. this product and the whole curly girl system is a great way to learn to love your curls and let them be free. i use this stuff every single day, i use it to wash/scrub my scalp with one a week or so, and on the other days i just use it to hydrate in the shower. also, the tiniest bit can be left in soaking wet hair for great results once dry. i will never need another conditioner as long as i live!btw, i pair this with the new deva volumizing foam for perfect curls every day :)

The Deva conditioner is great to use but it doesn’t have the slip for leave in. I wash my hair with this, I feel for my hair that there is too much protein. My curls are a 3A/B and very dry at the ends. I leave it in my hair so the squish and put it up in a tee shirt to dry until 80% dry.

I adore the DevaCurl products and how they have transformed my hair. It feels soft and I can put my hands through it without it being all sticky like throughout the rest of my lifetime when I was using regular kinds of shampoo and conditioner. The only thing about these products, is you really have to commit to using them in order to see the change. Watch the videos and read about them and see if you want to try it out. The first time I tried the product line, my hair felt gross and I switched back to my old stuff within a couple days. But the problem is that your hair needs that time to get used to not having the dimethicone coatings and re-learn how to absorb hydration. So, I think that Deva recommends using a clarifying shampoo before you begin. I recommend this. Or just be very very patient and stick with it!After I had originally quit, I went back to it and stuck with it, and now have been devoted to Deva products for almost one year. My curls fair much better now in humidity, and overall my hair looks and feels so much healthier.The OneCondition is a must have, and it smells so lovely, a soft lemon scent, which makes me think of Frozen Italian Icees I used to have in the summer as a kid :)

I have used Deva Curl products for some time and tried the newer Delight conditioner but it was too lightweight and rinsed out too fast so it was hard to detangle my hair and I felt there was none left for the benefits of a leave-in conditioner.

This stuff actually makes sure that I retain the color I get at the salon and that my curls are well hydrated..I use a little on my wet hair to detangle with my fingers.  then I use ANgel while wet afterwards..I wash my hair three times a week and have an easy regime in rewetting and reconditoning between washes.

This product line is the only one I have ever used that actually works. My hair is curly ALL THE TIME. On a rare occasion I will have what I refer to as a ""halo of fuzz."" I use it on my hair after I wash it and then I put some on the ends just before I use the styling cream.

Had my hopes up this was going to be a great product from the reviews. Was a little disappointed in the product. Great delivery, fast shipping, but that's about where the excitement ended. I have very curly, frizzy dry hair, not helped by coloring and bleaching. Have used this for about a week to give it a fair try, but haven't had good results. Hair is still very dry, curls aren't soft. Honestly going back to Pantene pro v because it works better on my curls and hydrating than this product. The smell is also a con, read reviews that it smelled nice, must be my taste but did not think it smelled good at all. Sorry to be against the grain but as a naturally curly hair person this didn't cut it. Good luck if you try but it's a pretty expensive gamble. Not recommended for dry frizzy curls.

This is the only thing I will use in my highlighted curly hair. Works great :). I use the No Poo shampoo 2x per week and this stuff daily. I tried it as a leave-in and that was just too greasy for me (especially by the scalp) but as a traditional conditioner you can't beat it. I'm not a huge fan of the scent but it is not offensive in any way (I just think other products smell better). That's not enough to stop me from using it though.

This is my go to rinse since I stopped using shampoo after first Deva salon styling 15ish yrs ago. Very rarely use Deva no poo or low poo. If you are looking for good conditioner to wash with.  this is great choice. Sometimes I do one ""wash"" and acsecond condition, sometimes one for all. Leave a little in on purpose or by accident and it's like a leave in. Add 1/2 water 1/2 One Condition to spray bottle and use it as a sunscreen/curl reviver.

It makes it easy to comb through your hair and it simply makes your look it's best. My whole family uses it now because it's just that good.

Not as good as I hoped. Was recommended to me, but disappointed and very expensive. I have found less expensive,  way better moisturizing conditioners through the curly girl method websites.

It took me 4 decades to figure out how to keep my hair from being dry and frizzy.  I have been using this conditioner, the gel and the shampoo for a year now and I will never switch again.  I get compliments on my curls every single day.  The only compliment I got before was ""Nice haircut"".  Now everyone wants to know how I get these curls.  I finally stopped fighting my curly hair and let it do it's own thing with little help from me.  I finally know what it is like to have moisturized hair that is pleasing to the touch.  This product also gives a beautiful shine.  Love it love it love it!

The DevaCurl line is incredible.  It's the only shampoo and conditioner I can use on my naturally curly hair that doesn't make it frizzy and too soft that it becomes puffy.  Highly recommend!!

Oh, you have dehydrated curly hair, and you've tried every product you could afford (and maybe a few you couldn't) in an effort to make your hair look healthy and happy?  Yeah, me too.  I have wavy-curly hair (type 2B for your curly girls in the know)  - and I couldn't seem to find a conditioner that was not too heavy, but actually moisturized my hair.I bought a trial package of Deva Curl at a salon, and this conditioner (and the no-poo) had me HOOKED.  I use this everyday, and I have even taken to co-washing (i.e. using conditioner to wash my scalp) with this product - and it is the best.Highly recommend it to women with my hair type - and probably type 2A/2C as well (but I'm not a professional!).

REVIEW Update Mar 2015: I'm back to say the following review is for the first bottle of One Condition I ever bought. It was creamy and rich. The SECOND bottle I purchased, from a different seller (BeautyEncounter) was watery and a big disappointment. I have read other reviews where watered-down product was mentioned as an issue and some suggest only buying directly from Deva Curl. Yes, well. It's pricey over there on the Deva Curl website!  My experience tells me that genuine product CAN be had from Amazon sellers, but it's a guessing game as to which ones. And finally, I can tell you that the real deal has a consistency similar to cold cream; it does not *pour* or *slosh around.*The Original Review:Given how a bunch of reviewers say they got watered down and/or rancid product, I had trepidation ordering One Condition for the first time this way. I feel confident though, that my Seller ""Infutech"" supplied an authentic product. I have never seen a conditioner like this; it's so thick it's like putting body lotion in your hair. My hair, which I think is ""cherub curls"" with a smattering of gray in the crown, was clearly moisture-starved and soaked it up. I skipped past any business of applying it, rinsing it out and then applying more as a leave-in - which strikes me as a very efficient way to run a lot of expensive conditioner down the drain in short order - and instead just used it as a leave-in for several weeks. What a difference! It actually looks like *human* hair now, not something you'd see on an old ratty-nest-haired doll baby. Oh, and the scent? Swoon-worthy.

I don’t think this is an authentic Deva Curl product. My hair is frizzier than ever, clumping and comes out very easily! The first bottle I purchased from a salon and lived it. This product didn’t even smell the same. I should have returned it but instead I kept using it. My poor hair.

This conditioner, along with the rest of the Deva Curl line works magic on my hair. Before I had a baby my hair was curly with many ringlets, springy curls etc. After baby my hair changed and I couldn't hold the curl anymore. My hair would end up straight, wavy and curly and look a mess. This product line has given me consistent curly hair with very little straight and wavy spots. Do not brush your hair between washings! You must remoisten a little in the am and twist it a little to refresh curl. Then spray the stray hair. Again do not brush, comb or pick it.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I highly recommend this conditioner! I use only their products on my hair. If you have curly hair, this is the product line to use. I searched for years trying to find the right products for my curls. When my hairdresser recommend these I never went back. I've been using them loyally for over 8 years now—love, love love! For extra conditioning and to help with fly aways / frizz, add a little bit to your hair after you towel dry while it's still wet but before you add gel/styling product — it works wonders!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I have used this conditioner for years. It's very thick and good for cowashing curly hair.  It's a great price in the 32 oz bottles on Amazon compared to buying the product in smaller bottles at Salons. One complaint is that often the pump tops are faulty, which is a pain.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I am not going to be a crazy convert who thinks this is the only conditioner on the planet (though I did buy enough to last me forever), but I do like it. I went on vacation without it, and as always, my hair seemed to enjoy the conditioner of the day supplied by whatever hotel I was in. (Which is why I don't think it can be the be-all/end-all of hair care.) But it does lead to a pretty successful proportion of good hair days. My hair especially likes it when I add a little bit in as a leave-in conditioner after I get out of the shower.

Does not remove the knots well that naturally curly course tends to have. Made hair too soft so there was a lot of puffiness and frizz.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I've been using Deva One Condition for years, and the product I received from vendor Pharmapacks has clearly been tampered with. Smelled awful, like industrial cleaning chemicals, nothing like the typical scent of the conditioner.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I use this both as a regular conditioner and as a leave in, I have super thick kinky hair and I love this product.As a leave in, I definitely still have to add styling creams and a dab of argon oil, but this product doesn't weigh down hair while providing moisture. So if you are looking to use this as a leave-in and looking for something that will weigh down against shrinkage, you'll have to use something heavier in conjunction with this product because it isn't heavy at all.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I didn't like this conditioner. My hair hasn't been curling much since I started using it a few days ago, so I think this conditioner is weighing my hair down. It does have a nice floral smell, like roses. I wish I had stuck with my One Condition DeLight.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I experienced hair falling out more then usual so much so that,  I tossed the almost full bottle $33.00 conditioner.  The scent was also strange  and did not smell like the first bottle I purchased in the salon.  I'm done with hair products in Amazon save yourself the money $$$$  and save  your hair!!!!!  Buy products at salons and reputable vendors not worth the hair loss.  Horribly dissatisfied wish I could give it zero stars.

The best conditioner I have ever used! Amazing how it makes such a difference in the texture of my hair. It makes my curls soft and my hair bouncy and less frizzy. The only thing that would make this better is a more pleasant scent.

I went to the DevaCurl salon when the first opened 15 years ago in Soho and I've been using their products ever since. Could not recommend their stuff more. However, the price has gone up a lot.This review is just to point out that its cheaper to buy 2 32oz bottle separately then this combo pack together.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
Smells like wax or like lice shampoo. Aside from that great product. If you’re going to buy 2 conditioners get the single one & just change the quantity to 2 because If you get the 2 pack you’ll pay like 15-16 dollars more than if you doubled the single pack.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
This is the best conditioner I've ever used on my frizzy, dry, curly, color-treated hair. I sometimes use it instead of shampoo (I also use Deva Curl's No Poo) to clean the sweat out of my hair after a hard workout on the days when I don't want to use both the No Poo and the conditioner. You can rinse it all out or leave some in for extra moisture. My hair is never greasy. My only complaint is that the scent of this one (sort of a light Skittles scent) doesn't really go with the light rose scent of the No Poo. However, even when I use both of them, the scents don't linger in my hair, so there's no obvious clash.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I rotate my products routinely as I think it helps my curls. Deva Curl One Condition is definitely in the rotation and will be required on a day like today, when my hair is tangled in a rats’ nest.

As a woman with curly hair who has struggled for year (YEARS!!) to get it right, I had almost given up hope.  But due to peer pressure I tried this product and immediately fell in love.

My hair stylist recommended this but I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money. I'm happy  I did. I have thick, long curly hair and I love this product. I use it instead of shampoo on nights that I don't shampoo my hair and my hair feels clean! I've used other conditioners to do everything but I've never felt like my hair truly gets cleaned, especially my scalp. But this product works! My hair feels light and soft after using it. I usually use a diffuser after I shower and put a little product. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a new conditioner!

Purchased after reading ""Curly Girl The Handbook"" by Deva Curl, and I now only use DEVA products in my long curly hair.Following the recommendations from the book, I do not thoroughly rinse this out of my hair.  I have slowly worked up to only briefly rinsing my scalp and then squeezing all the excess out before wrapping in a soft towel to dry.  My hair stays soft & curly with no gunky feel. LOVE this stuff!I do use a TON of this to get through my long curls, so I use SUBSCRIBE & SAVE to keep a new bottle coming every month! :-D
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I have curly hair and its tends to behave bad at most times until I started using this product. I stopped spending money on any other conditioner. I use this product every day and cant live without it. I would like it to smell like coconut (favorite frangrance) but the lemon grass smells good and clean. I use this together with the no-poo shampoo and daily deep conditoner by the same company. the product does cost a pretty penny but I think its worth the spurge. I save up and purchse it through amazon as its much cheaper than in the salon.

Devacurl products are amazing!! Learning how to care for my daughters beautiful ringlets has been a wild ride full of disappointing products whose marketing didn't live up to its word.

I highly recommend this product to everyone when they ask how I get her curls to be so tame yet beautiful.

Best shampoo for curly or wavy hair. The longer I use it the better my have gets. I never use anything else. My hair only requires washing every 3 weeks or so.

There is a noticeable difference between this and other conditioners--and I can prove it!How?By how much my hair curls after using it. The more moist your hair, the more it will curl. My DevaCurl-trained stylist said it was true, but I've tested it. Nothing is better for my curls.

I've been trying to grow my super extra curly hair but have not been able to retain length. After a very expensive hair cut, I was recommended the DevaCurl projects and I use the One Condition Conditioner for all my styling needs, I no longer use gels, mousse, sprays...

I’ve been using deva products for several years and love them. I’ve ordered them a couple of times from amazon and they seemed to be the same quality as the product from the salon and deva website. This time, the conditioner is totally different. The scent is off and the texture of the conditioner is terrible - almost like a plasticy texture and not at all creamy. Would never order again.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
returned it... it seemed diluted compared to the same product in a smaller bottle bought locally.  That being said, I don't think someone tampered with it but that the factory makes it thinner so it can settle in this big bottle. If it was the thick consistency it wouldn't be able to settle so you couldn't pump it out. That also explains the low price.

Wavy hair lady. Product I used to use wad discontinued and I have final found my new replacemnt! I am using the no poo shampoo. Conitioner and the light gel! Use lore product than you think you need!!! Does Not make my hair crunchy. I use the products then scrunch with a towel, add light gel then use diffuser w hair dryer. It probably  would air dry nice too. Super soft feeling! A must try for wavy / barely curly hair

I have been using this product for 2 years and love it. This along with No-Poo is the best products around. They do not strip your hair with harsh detergents or leave slimy conditioners in your hair. Leaves your hair almost tangle free. Love it. Fast shipping and a great price.

I used DevaCurl Products for a year and had incredible results. The last time I replaced my products I had a terrible reaction. This product caused my scalp to break out and become very itchy. My curls were dry, brittle, and undefined. It took weeks before my curls came back once I stopped using this product. The products are not the same as they used to be.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I had read such good things about the Deva Curl line and talked to people who recommended it for my hair. Perhaps my expectations were too high. This product was very heavy and left my hair feeling heavy and weighed down. My frizz gets worse when products end up gummy like that so I can't with clear conscience recommend this. The Deva Curl line is generally more expensive than brands like Matrix. I have corkicelli curls that are prone to being frizzy and dry and this didn't help that at all.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
This is my ""go to"" conditioner. I have very curly-kinky hair and I use a lot of conditioner every day. Deva Curl delivers just the right amount of conditioning without being to heavy. It gives enough slip so that I can comfortably comb through my medium thickness curly hair without excess pulling or breakage. I don't have to use so much product that I go broke either. It is a great every-day treatment. The smell is wonderful but not overpowering. I don't smell the conditioner after my hair is dry.

I've often struggled between products to find a good, all purpose hair conditioner. I had an afro for the longest time and would see my ends get brittle and dry quite often. After going to a Deva Curl specialized salon (with a bit of skepticism and a lot of cash), I was hooked on my new look, letting my natural curls go free. That was over a year ago and I haven't looked back since.Obviously, the salon recommended the Deva Curl products they used for daily maintenance. I bought a few different brands to try out - Deva Curl, Miss Jessie's, and Carol's Daughter - to see what the difference would be for daily care. The Deva Curl One Conditioner hands down provided the best, most sustainable results with added moisture without the hard texture of most foams and conditioners. I sometimes use their gels for a light hold but usually just use the conditioner and go. And I use it EVERYDAY with my hair actually growing out (hasn't happened in years).I'm a happy brand addict and love the large container since I use so often. If you are on the fence about Deva Curl, go for it! You won't be let down.

This is an excellent product, when it's authentic. Like many others here, I received very watered down versions, and I don't think it even has the same fragrance, so it may not even be Deva conditioner in the bottle.

One of the best products I've used for naturally curly hair. Its the only conditioner I use on my hair. If you have curly hair I recommend this highly. If you haven't read Curly Girl then you should.

I am a curly-haired, DevaCare fanatic.  This is one of the few products that truly controls my frizz and softens my hair.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
This conditioner is good at untangling my hair, but is quite a lot thinner than what I received in a sample pack from DevaCurl.  This means I use a lot more of it per shampoo than I did of the sample.  It made me wonder if they had recently changed the product to make it thinner, rather than up the price.  I liked the sample better as it was easier to handle -- not so runny.  But it works - you just need more pumps.

Product arrived as seen in picture, conditioner has oozed out of the bottle. It doesn’t seem like a lot, but it’s a bit disappointing to spend this amount on conditioner only to lose some in the shipping. Item was packaged well, box not damaged. I suspect freezing temps might be the culprit.

I have curly hair, and have tried many products. Deva Curl  conditioner is wonderful. Just rub in and rinse and with the option of leaving it in for extra conditioning is just an extra bonus.

I have been using the Devacurl shampoo and loving it, so I decided to try their conditioner, too.It's a pretty light conditioner, but it's great for daily use (I don't wash my hair daily but I do condition it when I shower).The smell is a little sharp to my sense, though. Citrusy, but more in a cleaning-the-bathroom kind of way, rather than a tropical-getaway way. Maybe they have different scent options, if so I'll try them too.

Meh don't love it.  You end up having to use so much it leaves my curls limp, greasy, and does not really do anything to help with the super dry ends that suck moisture up like crazy.

This is just not the holy grail for curly hair.  sigh----- the search continues.

Too heavy for me (fine, wavy, low porosity, 2B) but it might work for someone else so I'm giving it 3 stars to be fair. It smells like my grandma. It's subtle and not overbearing, but I don't like to smell like a cute little old lady, no offense grandma!

When I received the bottle, I couldn't figure out how to actually use the pump. I tried twisting it all sorts of directions but never get it to puff up so I could use it. I got frustrated and ended up breaking the top, which stinks but was my fault for getting frustrated. I just used the product directly from the bottle without the pump and I must say, THE CONDITIONER IS AWESOME. It really leaves my hair feeling nourished and soft without leaving buildup. It smells a little funky but that's personal taste, I don't like lemongrass.I only gave it four stars because I couldn't open the dang pump. Otherwise it would have been 5, it is a very good product.

I have wavy hair and this product works great. It definitely works the best of all of the products made for curly hair that I've tried, like Ouidad, and some drugstore brands. It's very hydrating and used with the no poo shampoo, it leaves your hair frizz free and nicely wavy, or curly. My daughter uses this as well and her hair is much curlier and thicker than mine. It also doesn't weigh down the hair or leave it looking over conditioned. Great product.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
This is my favorite conditioner! I finally started learning how to really take the best care of my curly hair earlier this year and I started out using this product. Since then I have tried two others but the difference with Deva Curl is so noticeable. Leave a little on your hair as a leave-in treatment and you'll have soft, touchable curls all day long. Paired with some styling cream and a foam my hair is finally frizz-free without needing a sticky mousse or hard gel. I love my hair, but this conditioner helps me love it right.

The scent and texture is NOT EVEN CLOSE.  This product is a scam.  Do not purchase it.

This stuff has way to much hype. I have super curly hair and it didnt do anything for me. Not impressed. Didn’t help detangle or add curl structure at all.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I like the product but, when it arrived, there was a good bit of the product that had leaked out so I don't feel like it was a good enough value for the money. Since it has a pump, it should have been packaged better.

..but I love the Decadence version much more.  This conditioner would probably be better for warmer climates with higher humidity.  In the place where I call home, we need more moisture.

I have been using Deva Curl products for about 4 years now. This is my favorite line of hair care products for my curly hair. The conditioner is light weight-not greasy at all and helps my curls stay shiny and well formed. I recommend Deva Curl Ultra Creamy Daily Conditioner for anyone with curly hair. I originally found this line at a small hair salon in Southern CA and had trouble finding it later. I was very happy to discover that I can buy it from Amazon.

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
The product description and picture said “Original” not “Decadence” I prefer the “original” scent (cleaner, fresher) to the Decadence (Coconuty) and that is why I ordered it. It came today, and the bag on it is labeled “original” but the product is the decadence. Is this an error? Do you not have the original?

Expensive but works well and smells amazing. This product feels nice on my hair and doesn't have much of a scent. What scent it does have is very fresh and slightly lemony so that I am not overwhelmed by it. I have been getting lots of compliments on my hair since I started using it. I use it as a leave-in conditioner.

Something was wrong with this conditioner. It was almost as if it was mixed with something else. I have bought this conditioner before from Ulta so I know how it should feel in your hair and even in your palms and something was definitely wrong. Do not buy it, it was a waste of money and not the real thing.

This is the second time I’ve purchased this conditioner and I live by it now. Worth the money! Nothing has ever left my curls feeling so light and soft at the same time. Moisturizes without weighing down your curls

Originally, I loved the scent of this product.  However, after a few months, I noticed my hair was shedding way more than normal.  Low and behold, it was because of the Deva Curl. My hair is noticeably thinner. This is happening to a bunch of other people as well. AVOID FROM USING.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
Deva curl products are great, I highly recommend them. BUT the product that was delivered to me was not an authentic Deva Curl product.  The conditioner felt more like a lotion and smelled something like bug-spray and rose water... nothing like the original product you buy in a salon. I went as far as speaking with a certified Deva Curl retailer about it to see if they had changed their product and was assured the one I received from here was a fake.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
Smells gross, feels like it dries out my hair. I did not leave this conditioner in as it suggests but it just made my hair feel brittle and dry. I didn't like it at all! My hair looked nice but only after using Moroccan oil after this conditioner. I have thin, easily tangled hair and this didn't help to smooth my hair out at all, just tangled it up worse.

To be clear, I have thick wavy hair that is bobbed.  I thought that since this stuff is for curly hair it would be good for making my waves more pronounced.  I bought this, the Low Poo Shampoo and the B'Leave-In styling gel.  First off, all the scents smelled over-powering and fake to me.  They actually smelled like laundry detergent (talking Tide etc. here, not Mrs. Meyers).  Worse, they left my hair dried out and dull!  The first time it happened I thought it was the leave in styling gel, so the next time I just used the shampoo and conditioner and let my hair air-dry with no product.  My hair was still frizzy and felt like it was dead.  I have come to the conclusion that these are obviously not for my hair!  I went back to using my old stand-bys, EO Organics French Lavender shampoo and conditioner (much more natural, cheaper, more pleasant smelling and no nasty sulfates either).  Also applied Beauty Without Cruelty's Leave-In Conditioner.  My hair is back to being soft and shiny, just looks healthy.  I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this stuff.

I've been using Deva Conditioner for years and years.  I think this batch is old as it is very, very thick and I have to take the top of the bottle and squeeze it out that way.  It does not work it you try to pump it out.  Very disappointed and hope it doesn't happen again.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I love this conditioner. I love that it doesn't weight my hair down, that it doesn't have harsh chemicals in it and that it's specially formulated for curly hair. My curls behave so much better after using this conditioner! I have less frizz, fewer flyaways and overall better-looking, more manageable curls. I highly recommend this to anyone with curly hair! It's so so worth it!

"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
My hair is so much softer and more manageable now that I have been using the Deva product line. I love it so much and I try to get everyone who has curly hair to use it. I never loved my hair until I read Curly Girl and started using the product line. Now I'm so proud of my unique curls. Definitely give it a try and give it a good month or so for your hair to start changing. It doesn't happen overnight!

This is the second bottle of Deva Curl One Condition that I've purchased through Amazon.  The first bottle was thick and creamy.  The second bottle came with a piece of tape over the top instead of shrink wrap and is definitely watered down - I got it through the amazon.com distributor G-Deal.  So I strongly suggest avoiding them, though they might not be the only distributor cheating us.Note that I really love this product - it does amazing things for my curls.  Maybe the only way to get the real thing is directly from Deva.

This is an incredibly moisturizing conditioner.  I use it in conjunction with No-Poo and Set it Free.  I ""wash"" with No-Poo, condition with One condition, they apply more as a leave in after my shower.  I follow up with Set it free on my damp hair, and scrunch.  It has brought my hair back to life and beautifully defines my curls.  I love you Devacurl...don't ever change!

Finally a conditioner that works for my frizzy, wavy hair
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
This conditioner is a great detangler and moisturizer. I've used it on and off for 5 years.  The smell is pretty strong, kind of like lemongrass, lemon-lime, and kiwi. Any stronger and it would be too much IMO.  This works nicely if you follow the Curly Girl method the creator of DevaCurl invented and don't rinse all of it out.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't so pricey.

I love this conditioner and have been using it for years, but the last time I bought it, the scent was off. One of my favorite things about this conditioner is the scent, so this is quite unfortunate. It still seems to work as well as usual, but I don't think I'll be buying this product online anymore in the future.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
This stuff is positively stinky. There is so much perfume type scent to it that I could smell it, sealed, in a sealed envelope when it arrived. And the smell on my hair was just not good. Way too strong of a smell. Product was mediocre, I used it once and won't be using it again.

I am graced with no fewer than three different textures of hair on my one head: 3b, 4A, and 4b,  It is very difficult to find one product that works great and equally well throughout my hair.  This one does the job.  My hair -- all of it -- feels like silk after I shampoo or co-wash, and all the curls define themselves according to their type.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
Not sue what the fuss is about-heard great things about this but after using it I wasn't any more impressed with the condition or curl factor than I am with any other salon product.  I'll stick with my usual regimen and skip this next time.  Can't justify the price here.

I used to use organix conditioners which I loved because it had so much slip which is necessary for my 3/b/3c fro which can take almost 30 minutes to comb out. Turns out organix conditioner is full of unhealthy silicones which was creating a shield on my hair and not allowing absorption of any oils I added to moisturize my hair. My hair was feeling dryer and dryer until I educated my self about silicones. I decided to try deva curl because of all the rage.. This product is Seriously amazing. It has just as much slip as any silicone based conditioner and even felt like it deep conditioned my hair. I now scrunch some in my hair at the end of my shower without rinsing and then add even more after I have microfiber towel-dried my hair. This stuff is the biz ness!

If I could give it a -(neg) rating, I would.  It's awful.  Never again will I buy something I haven't already purchased at a salon. After all the great things I've heard about this product, it was really a let down.  Either it was NOT the actual No Poo in the bottle or No Poo is garbage.  I'll stick with WEN even tho I liked No Poo's PRICE so much better than WEN

I've been using Deva Curl One Conditioner as my sole hair conditioning product for over 2 years. So I know what it should look/feel like. The bottle ordered from this seller arrived OLD. As in, it's so thick and hard to get out of the bottle as to make it almost un-useable. Usually, a bottle will last me between a month and six weeks. I will only get 3 weeks before the product is too thick to come out of the bottle. Buy One Conditioner. Its really great. But buy it from someone else.

This is not an exaggeration, as far as haircare is concerned (though there are more important things).I have wavy/curly hair that is very fine and for the bulk of my life has done exactly what it wants to do. If I found a product that enhanced curls, I got frizz. If I found a product that lessened frizz, I got greasy, straight hair. Not good.This stuff is expensive, obviously, so if you have something that is cheaper that works for you, I would say don't mess with a good thing. But if you've been searching for a line of haircare products that will give you consistent, beautiful curls (I sound like their commercial, sorry), I would highly recommend not only One Condition, but also the No Poo, AnGel, and Let it Be, which really helps with frizz. They make other products but I haven't tried those. I first bought the sample pack (which includes all the products I mentioned), which was a great way to try the foundation products without spending a ridiculous amount of money. I would also recommend their book - I think it's called Curly Girl. I'm not sure it's worth buying but it's definitely worth reading.

This is a high-quality, wonderfully fragranced conditioner which can be rinsed out fully, or only partially. Applying only a light rinse helps keep my curls in place.

And I like that its up to $8 cheaper on Amazon!

This conditioner is wonderful in my hair and I always get compliments for the wonderful scent it has. The rich floral smell is supposed to be lemon grass, but it doesn't smell lemony to me. I actually like it better. It smells like those white flowers from the south, magnolias, I think.

Simply the best condition for curly hair, hands down.  I get compliments on my hair all the time since I started using the Deva method of styling my hair.  This conditioner is key in the process!

I use this as a conditioner, and after final rinse, I let my hair drain for a while, and use it again to scrunch the girls, Keeps the frizz down and keeps the curl intact.  I have to use about 6 pumps for each washing, so get the big bottle. It goes fast enough. Smells nice.

Like another reviewer, I couldn't even get my comb through my hair with this ""conditioner."" After using this with the low-poo shampoo, my hair was a dry, frizzy mess and my scalp itched.

Oh how I wish I had never wasted my hard earned money on this product.

I originally purchased this conditioner along with the DevaCare No-poo.  I have really dry hair and was worried that this conditioner wasn't heavy enough.  But, it makes my hair super soft.  The best part is that it leaves very little buildup.  I've found that many other conditioners leave buildup that the No-Poo just can't remove.  Not the case with this conditioner.  I can use it with No-Poo and my hair still fills clean week after week.

I have wavy/curly hair and this conditioner is great.  I actually curls it more and separates the curls more.  My daughter has really curly hair and was so frustrated with it.

For my hair, this is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used.  I switched for a time, to save some money, to Dove conditioner, but I have learned that products that contain dimethicone, like Dove, will make my hair look heavy and greasy.

I am from European decent but have the driest, curliest, frizzest hair EVER!  In 38 years I have lookedfor a product that will make me tolerate my own hair.  This product actually makes me love my hair !!!  My hair is soft, mangable and has never looked so healthy.  It feels great while Im washing and after it dries.  If you have curly hair I promise this is the best product you have ever used!

My fiance uses this and loves it, it's a little cheaper than in stores and while some people say it's ""not the real thing"", she feels it is the real thing and does a good job

I've been using this product for over 10 years.  I don't know where I would be without it.I usually just use it in the shower and then scrunch my hair with the product in it.  Shampoo every 3-4 days as needed.  I have super healthy, hydrated hair.

I have semi-curly hair that tangles like mad.  Nothing I tried before would get the tangles out.  My comb slides right through after using this product.  I also use 1 pump as a leave in conditioner.  It does not weight my hair down, make it dirty or greasy.  It just makes it silky.  So grateful to have found this.

This product is fake. This is the first time i tried devacurl so i was surprised by the smell and watery texture of this conditioner. Just purchased same conditioner at ulta and what a difference! Wonderful conditioner when it's real. Please don't judge devacurl until u buy it from ulta

I have tried many different brands of conditioner over the years and this is by far the best product I've ever used on my long curly hair!! I've also followed the plan set up by Deva Curl and my hair is so much better overall.

When I received this product the bottle had busted open and there was conditioner everywhere in the bag it came in. The top is defective and doesn't work. I had to pour what I could salvage into another container. Extremely disappointed.

Born with unruly curls, I turn to DevaCurl for help.  This conditioner truly controls my curls.kinks and waves.  Preferring air to dry my hair, I often put a little dollop of the conditioner on my almost dry hair to ensure curl control.Beth

I have thick brown curls and I always use the DEVA line. I've tried so many others but I keep coming back to this one. The only thing is to buy the low poo (shampoo) and be mindful that it sometimes makes your hair look a bit greasy so sometimes I'll also use another shampoo just for the top as well.  I like using set it free spray after, but I wish it wasn't so expensive and I could buy a huge bottle instead of small.

I have to use more than it states but works well

If you have curly hair and haven't tried this yet, get some NOW!  It changed my hair completely.  I can even go without styling products and just put coconut oil in and my hair dries beautifully.  I will never go without this or the No Poo Shampoo!

I agree with other reviews.... there is something wrong with this product, it’s much thinner in consistency and the scent is horrible. My hair is damaged and starting to fall out
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
The second I put this on my hair I felt the softness and detangling while in the shower was a BREEZE!!! Love the way my hair feels now!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I agree with all the glowing reviews on this product.  It's the best conditioner I've ever used.  HOWEVER, please be aware that the Ultra Creamy Daily One Condition is the product with a sharp, soapy smell.  The One Condition which is labeled ""No Fade"" is the product with the wonderful orange smell DevaCare One Condition, No-Fade Ultra Creamy Conditioner 32 fl. Oz (946 ml).  I accidentally ordered, and now must return, this soapy smelling product.  Also, aside from a great hair conditioner, the anti-fade version is also remarkably effective at preserving hair color.  I'm impressed.  Hope this doesn't create confusion, but thought you should know so you don't accidentally order the wrong thing.

I love the silky feel I get when I rinse this product from my hair. It makes it easy to get a wide tooth comb through as I am rinsing, which is the only time I comb my hair. I give it 5 stars for that silky feel. But this product does not help my hair curl. I use Rockin Ringlets for that from another company.

I am caucasian and have dry wavy hair. My daughter has very curly hair.  I thought this might be good for us as we have hard water and our hair has been getting frizzy and damaged, but it just didn't work well for us.  Not quite thick enough.  Took a lot of product to condition our hair.

I have s'wavy/curly hair and I have used DevaCurl/Deva Care products exclusively for almost 10 years.  This conditioner is fabulous for curly hair when used with DevaCurl/Deva Care No Poo and Gel.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
It works better than most conditioners but I feel like I have to use a lot of the product to cover my whole head (because of the thick consistency). I recommend leaving it in for a few minutes before washing it out to get as much moisture from the product as possible.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I use this one condition every day. I wash my hair one or two times a week but condition every day. This conditioner is creamy and washes out clean. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I've found.

I love One Condition! I haven't found a better conditioner. My boyfriend's barber (of all people) introduced it to him for dandruff. He uses it alone without shampoo, and it very satisfied. I'm sure the name scares off potential male customers.

Having curly hair this is the  best product I've found that doesn't weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.  It provides a good conditioning without the frizziness and the curl looks great.  Seller was prompt in delivery and the packages was well packed.

I've tried dozens of hair conditioners but most didn't make my hair curl -- just frizzy.  But on the advice of a co-worker I tried the Deva products and I'm astounded at how well they work.  The conditioner makes my hair soft and gives my curls definition without frizz.  I'm a huge fan!

The product came to my home broken. The pump broke but the item itself surely did work on my hair. I already have natural curly hair and this product really defined it. I would purchase this again without hesitation! But hopefully the next time I order this the pump will be in one piece.

I purchased this product in hopes that it would really hydrate and moisturize my hair, however it did none of those things. I have very curly dry hair this product didn't help keep my hair moisturizer at all. Won't purchase again.

This conditioner is so thick I can barely squeeze it out of the bottle.  It doesn't seem like authentic Deva Curl conditioner or it is so old that it has thickened up to a consistency of a thick cream.

I have frizzy wavy hair.  This product makes my hair feel clean and it smells amazing.  My hair is below my shoulders, and I only have to use a quarter size amount.  It makes my hair curl when shower at night and go to sleep with it wet.  It also looks great when I blow dry straight.  I use the One Condition conditioner with the No Poo cleanser.

This is the best conditioner for people with unruly curly hair. You can also use it as a leave-in conditioner which makes a really great styler. I didn't discover it on Amazon but decided to buy it off Amazon because it was cheaper here than at Ricky's NYC.

I have been using Deva Curl products for over last two years and have been very pleased with the product and results, until recently when decided to buy it on Amazon instead of the salon to save a few dollars. What a mistake. I am convinced this is not the same product! It should be called ""No Condition"" as it has left my hair as if it wasn't conditioned. I have noted from other customers saying that it has been watered down, maybe, I don't know. It's a waste of money and time.Signed,Disappointed

I was looking for a product that will give softness and moisture back to my curls and this is not the product for me.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
Upon reading all the wonderful reviews about this product, I decided to buy this and the Lo-Poo by Deva. BIG mistake. This actually left my hair hard and my curls flat by morning. I was very disappointed in this product and really wanted to like it, but after numerous attempts, alas, it just does not work for me. A hefty price to pay for a product that does nothing but leave my hair smelling perfumed, hard, dry, and flat by morning! I do however use the Deva gel and it's great. Just too bad this was not the same. I will continue to be a ""curly girl"" and use L'Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Conditioner that is 100% vegan and not tested on animals with no animal byproducts.

When I started my natural journey, the Devacurl line were the first (and only) products I used. However, I transitioned to other products because I thought I needed a thicker conditioner than this one. Recently, as of 2016, I have went back to this staple product of mine to condition my hair really well. I wash my scalp and rub a little on my hair, then wash it out with cold water. I will reapply a light layer of this product, and put in leave-in conditioner afterwards, or a heavier conditioner as a leave-in.

I have naturally wavy, fine, somewhat dry hair, but with this product I can make my natural wave turn into soft natural curls.  I usually combine it with the DevaCurl Frizz Free Foam, use a diffuser, and am able to get some amazing curls.  I use this product in the shower and rinse it, but apply another small amount to my towel dried hair and leave it in.  It doesn't weigh my hair down and really helps keep it from looking dry whether I straighten it or leave it curly.  This is my go to for sure oh and it smells great!

This is not the One Condition I always order.  Deva Curl One Condition is white in color and has a disctint aroma. This is beige in color and has no scent.  I don't know if this was a knock off of Deva product, but it is not what I usually order.  I don't hate it, but wouldn't reorder.

I first used the DevaCurl trial kit that I had purchased from Ulta Salon and fell in love with the product.  I wanted a larger quantity for me and my daughter so I purchased the 32oz pump. It was too expensive at Ulta so I tried Amazon, since it was cheaper.  The product is different.  I will not purchase again, it seems to be watered down.

I love Devacare One condition, but since switching to this conditioner my scalp has been really dry.  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have to put LOTION on my scalp because it itches so badly.  When this bottle is empty, I'm going back to One.

Having suffered with curly frizzy hair for years, I was thrilled to finally find a product line that winter spring summer and fall never fails me.  I use this after no pooing with deva curls ""no poo"" and between the two products my mass of thick untamed curls and frizz becomes more than manageable....  it becomes soft and silky.I know you are supposed to wash curly, frizzy hair less frequently but with the deva curl line there doesn't seem to be any problem with washing way more often.  And, frankly, my mop of hair looks much better the day of a washing or the day after so I am thrilled to have a product I can use more often.  And you don't need a lot so this bottle is going to last a good long time.BOTTOM LINE:  This product has been an amazing antidote for my lifelong struggle with the thick, curly, frizz mop head of hair I've carried around forever
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Original, 32oz","
I'm a big fan of Deva products and this conditioner is light and great for everyday use.  It's also good to leave a little in the hair as a ""leave-in"".  Doesn't build up and is very gentle on color treated.

I have naturally curly hair (thick, coarse coils; tangles easily) I have been searching my whole life for the best conditioner for my hair type... DevaCurl One Conditioner is by far the winner!!

I have used and love DevaCurl because it takes out my tangles and makes my hair smooth. Unfortunately the one I received from Amazon was watered down and way less effective than the real stuff.

It can leave a waxy feeling at times when you leave it in, but it creates great curl definition, and I've been able to maintain my hair longer with it than other conditioners I've left in using the curlygirl method.

I have very long curly hair and it can be very frizzy if I don't use the right product.Well. I read all the reviews and thought I would try it. I LOVE IT!

My daughter, sister and I all use this product and all Deva care products faithfully!  Not only are you promoting a clean earth, but you are also giving your own body a chance to experience the greatness of organic body care.  Natural curls are happy! Color stays longer! Hair is soft yet manageable and has volume.  I do find that if I use my other organic shampoos now and then, this product works even better for me.  My daughter has very kinky hair and she finds that Deva helps to relax her curls to make them manageable.  We are trying to get our local salon to care the product.  Try it!  You will like it!

I use it every day both in and out of the shower.  It doesn't weigh my curls down, and after decades of crap hair, I finally have something of which to be proud.  It's worth the price, although my friend said she felt like she was rubbing money into her hair.  I'm comfortable with that feeling, if what I get out of it is awesome curls.

My boyfriend's barber (not a stylist, just a barber!) recommended this product instead of shampoo. BF was a bit turned off by the name, but tried it and we both use it now! This is a good size for 2, lasts 4-5 weeks.

I have been using Deva Curl products for the past  year and love it for my hair. This time I tried to save some money and ordered the One Condition from amazon. Big mistake. The product is definitely fake. It is not the same. I have used the one conditioner for a while I know how it makes my hair feel. This one from amazon made my hair feel rough. Also the neck of the bottle for the Deva conditioner that I buy directly from Devacurl website has some number codes on it. This one from amazon does not have it.I contacted Amazon by email indicating my concern even though I had passed the return timeline as I had some stock and opened this one after finishing the one I had. I must say that Amazon's customer service is fabulous. They refunded my entire money for this product and assured me that they will contact the supplier for this stock.Thank you amazon. A tip for anyone wanting to buy Devacurl. Please only buy from their authorized dealers. I would not purchase this from anyone else.

I don't have curly hair, but I still love this conditioner.  It makes my hair look nice and have a lot of body.  It's expensive, however, so I use it sparingly.

I have medium thick 2c curls and have tried and loved DevaCurl's No Poo and Light Defining Gel and I purchased the 32oz bottle confident that I would love it, but I don't. This feels good in the shower and right afterwards but by the end of the day my scalp is flaky and dry and my hair gets frizzy and feels like straw. The smell is slightly unpleasant too, like hair dye. Maybe I should buy directly from Deva Concepts. Anyway, I am so disappointed. I'm returning this and trying different conditioners.

My hair is usually a curly tangled mess, and a friend recommended this product; it really made a difference.  Only one other product comes close, I like the Ouidad line too...but Deva is a little bit better for my hair, it keeps the curls curly and looking natural.  Not like I put gel in it, just soft curls.  And it makes my hair feel healthy.  Very mild scent.  I highly recommend for curly hair.

OK, I love the regular one conditioner and thought this special version for colored hair would be just as great -- not so much. My hair looks dull, and it's not even close to the soft feel it had with the regular care one conditioner. I will use this up, but will not buy it again. I'll go back to the original.

Something may be wrong with this product. I have purchased it directly from the Deva Curl website and when I received it it had a creamy texture with an off white/beige color. The product that I received from this seller is not as creamy, white color, and not as effective. I may be wrong, but seems like its a different quality. I will be purchasing it from Deva Curl directly from now on. It's not worth the risk.

I've been using Deva Care No Poo and One Condition for over a year now and I love them.  I was on the brink of getting Japanese straightening and in a last ditch effort to manage the curls I decided to get a Deva cut at a local salon.  It kind of changed my life. My stylist gave me a Deva cut and then showed me how to style my hair using the Deva products and it made such a huge difference. I love this stuff and can't live without it.

What is this magic?! I've just used this for the first time and I can't stop staring at my hair. It's never looked this good. Ever. I think I have 2c/3a hair and I've never seen my hair curl so hard before. It's seriously amazing. I've just started trying to embrace my natural hair instead of hiding it and this stuff gives me hope. For real. It doesn't make my hair crunchy and it gives them some bounce. My hair usually gets fluffy after a while but not with this stuff. Nope. It's still going strong. Also, the smell is freaking amazing! I'm not a huge fan of coconut smells but this isn't like in your face coconut. It's like a summery coconut smell? It's good. Trust me.

I had been blow drying and straightening my hair for years, thinking I had weird waves that would never look good, until a friend had me try her devacurl, after wide tooth combing my hair, and then letting it air dry, and voila, pretty curls! The next day I bought this and couldn't be happier! It has made me love my prior frizzy now lovely waves and curls! And it smells great and doesn't leave a gross residue on your hands after application, I don't even rinse it off, it's like lotion as well! Best of all it has allowed me to sleep in a bit longer in the AM bc I just shower, throw this in my hair and go! Yay for low maintenance pretty hair! Plus I'm not ruining it with heat everyday anymore. Highly recommend!

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I cannot say enough good things about this product! It technically isn't for my hair type (2B/C), so I use a lot less than my friends with curlier/more hair. I have fine hair, and a lot of it, but I still have the wavy/curly texture...it's a very fun mix to have. It prevents my hair from frizzing and keeps my curls going for days. I don't have to do nearly as much to my hair to revive it on days 2, 3, or 4 as I used to. I use a tiny pea sized amount, mixed with a little squirt of the Ultra Defining Gel, and some water, to perk my hair up after taking it out of my nightly pineapple. I can now do this instead of wetting or spraying my hair, re-scrunching, and adding diluted coconut oil to my hair. It keeps curls clumped nicely and works very well with the Ultra Defining gel. I've actually started using less of the UD gel and can get away with just this product. I tend to have some fuzzies/fluffies/frizzies/fly aways without the UD gel (which I've been using for almost four years without fail), but this product has changed that a bit. A word to the wise, especially those with fine or wavier hair, buy a trial size first to learn more about how it works for you. That's what I did, and it lasted me almost a month. After I ran out, I ordered the big girl version and I'll definitely reorder in a while when I run out!PS: It smells delightful!

This is the first time I'm using the super cream. I originally used styling cream, and it did not work for my hair at all. I was a little skeptical that it would dry out my hair and make it look flat, which is a big no for someone with thin curly hair. But this one worked! My curls flourished after one use! They look so healthy and moisturized, and they got back their spring and volume. This works amazing with the light defining styling gel! And it smells amazing and doesn't feel to heavy on my hair. 10/10 recommend this combo, especially if you have thin curly hair.****************************************************************************************************I think I got a dud. Smells nothing like the first super cream I ordered back in January. The coconut smell isn't there, in fact it has a faint smell of styling cream mixed with something else. Left my hair dry and brittle, no volume or spring. Not even with the styling gel. This vendor is very hit or miss and unfortunately this time was a major miss.

The product says it provides hold, definition and , moisture. I don’t know how but it literally does all 3 amazingly!!! This is the holy grail. I’ve been natural for over 10 years and have yet to find a product for wash and gos that I really had good results with until now ! I’m amazed at how good it is. I have 3c/4a hair . I wish I tried this years ago. And it works great on wet or dry hair . I prefer wet. LOVE IT! My new go to!

Girls with curls this product is for you! I have been dying to try the SuperCream for quite some time so I finally gave in and did. I regret not buying it sooner because this product helped my hair so much! It gave my curls, the definition they were crying out for. I have type 3A curls that can have a mind of their own and my arsenal of products has helped but this alone gave me a 0-100 result in the first 2 days of using the product. My hair has never looked better and now I have people coming up to me asking what I'm using because they need an added boost. If your curls are looking for curl definition, then this is for you!

I didn't wanna like this so bad cause it's kind of expensive, but I've tried SO many curly hair products and this one is seriously the best curl cream.

I LOVE this cream. I used to use it as the last product on my dry hair, but I’ve recently started using it as the first product on my soaking-wet hair and WOW! More definition and soft curls. I was a little concerned that I’d received an old product because there was a sticker with a bar code on the side that clearly belonged to Amazon, but since I didn’t notice any diminished performance, I wrote it off as being a part of their inventory tracking. Curly girls, get this product. It’s so much more expensive in salons, so just try it! At this price, it’s too cheap to have anything to lose.

This didn't work for me.  I have fine wavy hair and this was recommend to me by my hairdresser.  She said she loved it on her curls.  It made her curls look great.  She has nice S defined curls.  For my hair it just weighed it down and looked dull.  I thought it would help control the frizziness of my waves but it doesn't help with that at all.  I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with hair like mine.

Oh man, if you have curly hair then you know the struggle to find a hair product that can actually tame your curls and frizz without drying your hair or making your curls ""crunchy"". I've been trying out different products to find the perfect one, and I've finally found my solution with DevaCurl!My curls come out so perfect and even. My hair doesn't look like I just got out of a shower all day. My hair is soft to the touch. Its even conditioned my hair so well that even when I don't have product in my hair, the frizz level is down like 75% and so soft!!I know all curly hair is different, but if you've had problems in the past, I recommend checking out this product. Its worked wonders for me!The smell is also nice, kind of coconut like I guess. I guess the smell is maybe the one area left to be desired, but I can't complain. Has a nice scent that isn't too overwhelming.

I would just like to say, I started using this about a year and a half ago and really loved it for my curls.. I am of the age I have just started to go get my roots colored.. My head was itching constantly and my hair was coming out in quite large amounts which is not normal for me at all.. I chalked it up to having to color the roots, my hair stylist said in no way should the color be doing that.. I also noted my scalp burned when getting colored.. so constant itchy scalp, hair falling out, breaking hair, limp curls hair becoming scragglier. I went to order my hair products 2 months ago and they were out of deva curl cream so I bought a different brand..  welll just the other day two months later I realized omg my head doesn’t itch anymore and my hair isn’t falling out, and the root color didn’t burn at all..still didn’t attribute it to deva curl until I saw an article on it causing this for millions of women and it all clicked, wow very scary! Needless to say it’s all gone now I still use all my regular products minus the deva curl I thought I loved.. To the company you really really need to figure out what is causing this and pull your products from the market until you do, as we women love our hair and it means everything to us and we all supported you by buying and loving your products, please respect us in return and honestly figure what is causing this to happen, fix the problem and then bring your products back when the are heathy for us curly haired girls..

I have long, fine and curly hair. I tried the DevaCurl gel and this cream...both made my hair super dry and frizzy. Not sure why this works for so many others but for me, it was terrible. One day, hopefully I will find the miracle product for my hair! Oh and I can't return this...wish I would have known that or I would have purchased from another seller. Bummer!

UPDATE: once I was able to clean off and reassemble, I tried this on my wet combination curl hair. It smells great and doesn’t leave my hair crunchy or frizzy. Not out of this world amazing, but did do a good job at defining my curls.May update product later after I actually use it. For now, 1 Star because this is how I received it.

I have thick, curly hair and this product gives me the right amount of support for my curls.  So many other ""curl"" creams are just too light to give me the hold I need.  Than there are the creams or gels that just make my hair crunchy and stiff.  This is the best one I've found in years.

I like it better than the older versions of the Deva Curl products. They had way too much fragrance. This one has a very nice smell that isn't overpowering. For my hair, it is just as good as much cheaper products. Also, the person who recommended it to me said that they just needed a tiny little bit to work, but I usually need about two pumps for my hair not to be frizzy - and I only have shoulder length hair. I won't buy again.UPDATE: I changed my hair and now it is much shorter. Since changing to a new style, I like the product better. I wouldn't say it is miraculous like some of the reviews but it is pretty nice. The only thing I don't like that I just noticed is that the price is much more now than when I first purchased it. With my new style I think I would purchase again, even with the higher price because it does last quite a while.

I got this for my curly/ wavy hair thinking it’ll help with the frizz and it just doesn’t do a great job. It’s been humid and hot past few weeks and after I apply this to my hair and by the end of the day it’s frizzy and not only that has a weird texture. It’s gross. Even when I don’t put anything in it and my hair frizzed up at least it’s soft and I can run my fingers through it. This makes it feel very sticky and nasty. Although I will say it’s a great substitution to hair gel. When I tie my hair up I can use this to flatten out little fly-away hairs. Definitely have to wash it out cause the texture is too sticky.

When reviewing hair products, the most important thing is to specify your hair type. I have curly, for real curly not scrunched, 2c & 3A curls. My hairs is Caucasian and it is not thin but fine, postpartum hair. I also have low porosity hair. This product just weight my hair down so much. My curls were dead. It went back.

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
First off, i love this product!! It leaves my hair frizz free and silky. When I first started using it, it weighed down my hair. My problem was i was putting too much when I only needed a tad bit since my hair is wavy. Now my sister's hair is really curly, and she has to use a bit more since it won't be affective if she uses too little. I have been using this for a couple a months now and it has made a drastic change in my hair. My hair felt dead before I bought this product, but after applying a bit every time I wet my hair, my hair now feels completely silky:))

The product itself is wonderful, however when opening the package after delivery it the top of the bottle was broken off and spilled all over inside the plastic bag it was in. I had to transfer the cream into a different product bottle that was empty. I’ve read in different reviews of this being a issue as well. Given I paid $15, I would like to be able to use all of it and not 80% of it.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
When I opened the package the product was sealed in a plastic bag and when I went to remove the cap the whole top came off - I love the smell and feel of the cream but I can not use the dispenser.  I was so disappointed and this may have happened during shipping because the product wan only in a folded cardboard mailer.  :(  I hope someone can help me with this issue.  I have added a picture for your review.  Thanks Tonya Sexton

I have tried everything on the drug store and salon shelves to tame the frizzy curls. Just threw out all that ‘otc’ crap and am now hooked on this wonderful curl tamer! I like being able to run my fingers through my hair and not create frizz or run into crunchiness. It really doesn’t take much, so don’t be intimidated by the size of the bottle. My gf turned me onto the shampoo and conditioner back in January after I answered the door after a shower with fresh dry hair. I looked like  a clown. Add this stuff and my hair is FINALLY soft and totally tamed. Oh, and it smells like coconut heaven lol!

This is the best product I've used for my curly hair--it's low-cost and lasts for a long time. I have average thickness hair cut in layers down to my shoulder blades and use one pump. It doesn't make my hair take forever to dry and the more I use it, the better it looks! Believe me, I've used them all--including a long stint with Aveda's Be Curly--and this is the best of them. If I had more money, I'd use the whole line of products for shampoo and conditioner, etc.

I absolutely LOVE this product, it moisturizers my hair and keeps frizz at a minimum. I would even go as far as saying that it is the BEST leave in product I’ve encountered so far on my Curly Girl journey. But this packaging? Horrible! I have to tap and shake the bottle for five minutes before a small amount of product shoots out. I need a lot of it to make my hair work, and I’m going to end up taking the bottle apart and putting the product in a travel size container to be able to use it easily.

I absolutely love this stuff! I have tried a ton of hair products for my 2c hair. It’s thick and coarse, can be frizzy and unruly. This stuff tames it! My hair is softer, less frizzy and it doesn’t leave any residue or buildup. The scent is a nice light coconut smell. I don’t see much difference regarding the length of time it takes to dry. But I wasn’t expecting much in that respect. A little does go a long way but even when I’ve used “too much” its not even that bad. It actually seems to help with humidity protection when use too much!

I received this yesterday and went to use it today.  Guess what?  The dispenser doesn't work so I have no way of even trying product.  I can't return it because I went to return it today and it says item in unreturnable.  How is a defective item I receive my fault?!  Also I see no way of contacting seller.  I read on some of the reviews negative things about this seller.  True or not I cannot say, but I will never buy from this seller again.  So guess whose out the money....me!

I have used this Deva Curl product for years and what I received WAS NOT Deva Curl. The reviews questioning the authenticity of this product (the tops completely off) are valid questions. The color and consistency don’t match Deva Curl. The smell is similar but off, it looks like the product was mixed with another. I have some DevaCurl I bought retail and I did a side by side comparison. Definitely different. Just a warning to other buyers.

This cams busted up in the packaging- the top part was disconnected from the bottle and I couldn’t get it to stay on in order to use the pump- so I just take the top off like it’s a lid and still use the product without the pump. I am giving it 4 stars though because the product is so good! I absolutely love the devacurl super cream as well as their other products!

AMAZING! As a Caucasian woman With very curly brown hair I have searched for what feels like decades for a product that would both moisturize my hair and provide a healthy loss. This product is lightweight and moisturizing without being greasy like coconut oil on its own.

I have been battling my wavy hair for years and finally found this product.. it's amazing! A little more pricy than I'd like, but some of the products that didn't work were much more expensive so I consider it money well spent. I don't use any of the other products in this line, but would definately consider giving them a try after the success I've had with this one!

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I am completly disappointed by this product. Let me be clear, my hair is naturally curly and is like a 3b. But i also have fine hair so it can be a bit difficult to find products that won't weigh it down and still give it a nice no frizz hold. And i really wanted to love this product so I tried to air dry my hair and I also diffused, but nothing. It didn't do anything different for my hair than other products that are 3x cheaper. It gave it some volume after diffusing but by the end of the night was a horrible mess and don't even think about second day curls. I woke up the next day looking like I hadnt brushed my hair the night before :( SUPER BUMMED, the search continues for a good curly hair product.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I’m giving this 1 star do to the fact it came oppened and most of the product is all over the inside of the box. This stuff is very pricy, what a waste:(

Devacurl Supercream weighs my 3A curls down. The only thing I could use this for is a straightening product, except I can’t tolerate the scent. It is so heavily scented, I was sneezing within 10 minutes. I don’t like heavy scents. I’d rather wear my nice perfume that I am not allergic to. This product also made my scalp itch. My curls were completely wiped out and my hair looked oily and unwashed. I used about 3/4 teaspoon in my thickish medium length hair. Very heavy on the hair. This one is probably good if your hair needs to be relaxed. Not for me. I need lift and bounce. Bummed after all the hype about it. It does put a lot of moisture in your hair if you like that. It took me 3 times longer to diffuse and I still couldn’t get all the way dry. I’m trying to think of someone I can give it to. Glad I didn’t pay full price at Ulta.

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I love how the Supercream enhances my naturally wavy-curls. It defines them without adding extra ""gunk"". My hair is still soft to the touch and the frizz is kept at bay. The coconut smell is not overpowering. My husband despises coconut anything and has yet to complain about the scent of Deva Curl.I ordered with Prime delivery but the guaranteed date was a week later. I was pleasantly surprised when the cream came within 3 days.

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I already use deva curl shampoo, conditioner, gel and now I add this to my gel while in shower.  since letting my hair grow out to its natural silver, it is a different texture and needs more moisture.  a little goes a long way, but keeps my curls soft and not frizzy.  do not over do it though if you have fine hair as it can be too much, but a little works magic

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Works great. Every time after I wash my hair, I would pump a quarter-size amount into my palm and gently rub into my hair when it's half wet. The curls immediately show and are better maintained. The key is to air dry the hair after using the cream. I think the bottle will last me for quite some time. The subtle coconut smell is also pleasant.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I’ve been using the Deva Curl styling cream but thought I’d try the Super Cream after reading the reviews. I’m disappointed. I have long medium curls and thick hair. I have to use twice as much of the Super Cream (2 pumps) to get the same control as I do with the Styling Cream (1 pump). I don’t love the coconut scent either, I prefer the sweeter scent of the other one.  It works ok but I’ll go back to the styling cream once it’s gone

Loving it!  My hair is very thick with tight tight curls, and is very dry.  The decadence gives me more moisture than all the other products.

I am a black woman with naturally curly hair and extra fluffy when wet. I usually choose light conditioners, such  as Pantene because it does not weigh down my hair, Phelps define my curls, and smells good. I was hoping that this product would be nice to follow up with after rinsing my conditioner but I need to throw it in the trash ASAP. It weighs down my hair, causing my curls to not be as defined as they were before I added the product. My natural curly styles do not look good after using this. The only good thing about this product is it’s smell.

DevaCurls are high recommended! I no longer use heat tools, I just add the stilyng products and use the foam wires around my hair at the beginning when getting ready to mold my curls and once I’m finished getting ready I take the foam wires to reveal my curls

I have fine curly hair. I have always used the Devacurl be leave in gel plumper and love the volume it gives to my curls. It I was looking for something that would not leave that crunchy feeling in my hair. I had high Hope's for this product but I have to say I really dont like it. The cream seems to weigh down my curls and even when using just a tiny drop it leaves a greasy feeling in my hair all day. Will not be buying again.

I like this product, I have wavy hair, not terribly curly. If I want to straighten it, this product helps. If I want to boost the curl, it does the job. Great product!

OMG love this product. I have wavy hair and this creates curls, no need for styling other than scrunching and then running my fingers through my hair when dry. Looks even better the second day when I use a small amount of product on my dry hair.

I love this product! Doesn’t leave any residue when it dries down. I had been using Cantu but i would always get a white residue in my hair that I really hated.

Great smell. Seems to soften curls and conditions but I still need a mousse or gel to get my best curls. Was hoping this would be more of an all in one product but if I don’t add mousse or gel, my curls are dry and frizzy.

LOVE Deva Curl products, this is a great cream if used correctly.  I have naturally curly hair so I do not need a lot of products in my hair just to define the curls.  I use this with the devacurl light defining gel and I do not use a lot of it.

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Good stuff, but I don't need to use it as much as I had expected because of other products I have.  Still, I am glad to have it on hand.  It is a little heavier than what I like, but it serves it purpose when I want that extra hold.

This is a nice product.  It’s not oily but it does have a The softener no effect that oil might have on hair.  You don’t need any other product with this.  It leaves your hair softly curled, bouncy and airy.  Not crunchy at all.  If you do want to ad more definition you can mix it with the devacurl foaming mouse. Wonderful product. I have 3b curls and I only use devacurl products.  I just with these products were more affordable but they very well can charge this much because it works! 😝

Only four stars because it does itch at night like every other product I've used. I'm trying to use less of it and see if that helps while keeping my hair styled. But it's one of the few products which tames my frizzy, curly hair and makes it somewhat manageable throughout the day.

I can't even begin to describe how amazing this product is. Where was this when I was a teen trying to tame my wayward curls?! It sculpts your curls but for real makes them touchably soft. I bit heavy but just go light at first to figure out how much you need. 1 to 2 pumps is perfect for me.

This is the only product I have found so far that actually helps tame my frizz (aside from gel, but I hate how tangled my hair gets with gel). I wasnt sure if this product was really doing anything until I forgot to put it on after a shower one day and my hair looked so frizzy and dry. I dont care for any of the other diva curl products, but this one is great.

Very creamy, my hair soaked it right up, left my hair moisturized all day.  It gave my curls moisture and volume, shrinkage is real, but not as noticeable as with other products.

I love that this product does not weigh my hair down and does in fact reduce the frizz. DevaCurl is the most effective and trustworthy brand out there. Moreover, this product works for wavy, curly, super curly, and coily hair it helps moisturize and tame frizzy hair. Not to mention the fact that it smells wonderful! You won't find it for a better price, as it usually goes for about 24 dollars in stores like Ulta and the official DevaCurl site. All in all I will never stop using this specific product, it leaves my hair soft, frizz free and smelling amazing.

I have been ordering these products for awhile through Amazon and this is the first time that I have ever been disappointed. See attached picture of how item arrived.

Can't even return it because it would just be ""goo"" in the bottom of the box like what I received and can't use it because the container was cut right below where the lid comes off and can't remove the lid to use the applicator. Won't be ordering these items again!!!

I finally broke down and spent the extra money for this product after hearing so much about it. I have nothing really bad to say about the product, it worked good and did what it was supposed to do. But I also use other products from the drug store that I felt had the same effect if not a little better on my hair and are half the cost or cheaper. It is good for curls, didn’t do much for my frizz but I just don’t feel that it is worth the prices that they have on their products

It worked pretty damn good in my hair. Did a great job of defining my curls but only if I blew it dry w diffuser (which it instructs you to do). My only negative thing is you really don't get any bang for your buck. I have thick hair but its short, above my shoulders and this lasted me not even 20 styles. (I ran out in less than a month). I love it but its just not a pocket friendly option for me and unfortunately, I'm ballin on a budget lol.

Bought this a few weeks ago and was so excited because I've heard a lot of good things about Deva Curl. However, I'm not a big fan.

I didn’t really notice a huge difference in my daughters hair when using this stuff. It kept the curls nice, but once it dries, some of her curls became loose and a little unruly. I didn’t notice that much of a change to make me want to buy this product again. It may work for some curly haired people, but sadly not on my daughters hair. I was recommended this product by two friends who swear by it. If you’re on the fence and are able to give this a try, I would say why not? Give it a try, but don’t have high expectations in case it doesn’t work.

For my very curly hair, this is the perfect product to add.  I use it on wash day as well as when I need to refresh my curls.  Because I use a small amount of product, it doesn't make my hair crunchy.  My curls are soft and hold their spring all day long.

I have combination 3a/3b hair that is very fine.  This product largely eliminates the frizz and makes my curls look like bouncy ringlets.  It works best when you put it on your hair when wet and scrunch it up towards your roots and then dry it with a diffuser.  There are great youtube videos on how to use the product.After trying this, I stopped using other curly hair products and am now a DevaCurl fan.

I have fine frizzy wavy hair with some curls in some parts of my head (more on the back). This cream makes me have curls all over, and they dont look frizzy after I put the cream on my wet hair.

Daughter has natural curly hair. This has always worked great to keep her curls natural and she doesn’t complain about any crunchiness-like other salon brands cause.  Worth the cost. Just give yourself a day or so to get the amount needed right.

I bought this to try it, and love it. But then I purchased the kit with many products and somehow I started getting scabs in my scalp. Great curl keeper but build up is horrendous. Try using less and hair got fuzzy. Not worth the money. Staying with Shea Moisture 12$ curl smoothie.

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I like this cream for my curly hair, but I find that I need to use a lot of it to get enough control and I end up using it way too fast for the price.  Still looking for something less expensive or longer lasting.

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
This stuff is fantastic especially when used with the DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner. I only use this now to fix my curly hair. I live in humid southern Louisiana and this controls any frizz I would have. The curl definition is great and my curls aren't crunchy. I will never use anything else!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I cannot say enough about how much I love this product line! I have extremely thick, dry and coarse hair. After my first use, my hair feels silky smooth, is shiny and my curls are bouncy and frizz free!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHERS FROM DEVA CURL!!! I’ve experience damage, curl pattern changes, and extreme damage to my hair using these products. They worked the first couple times and over time, the damage is so noticeable. Save your money and your heartache.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
If you are looking for something with minimal to max control this is a great product even for shorter wavy hair. I have short hair and use about a teaspoon or so. It's soft, fresh smelling with a hint of coconut. One really good thing about this is the container. On one side is a peekaboo opening that allows you to see how much product is left. Great idea!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
It left my hair hard, white flakes, and it did not do anything exciting to my curls. This product is just not working. I used the SuperCream, Curl Plumper, and they both did not work on my type of hair.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
The coconut scent is simply not one of my favorite scents, so I prefer the STYLING cream scent over this one. However, it works just like the styling cream. Apply to wet/damp hair to magically create controlled curls!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Product is a knock off . Makes sense to why it’s xheaper than usual. It has made my hair super dry and the ends feel nasty . Very disappointed in the seller .
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
This cream is amazing! I usually use extra conditioner to style my hair but this does the trick perfectly! Doesnt make your hair hard feeling like most stylers, makes a nice soft natural look. Can put in dry and wet hair for different looks. Deva curl is definitley my new go to for naturally curly hair products im in love with this cream! Pretty big bottle as well.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I love it.  I was turned onto Deva products by my daughter.  Skeptical.  This product not only defines curl without hairspray or whatever, but it adds volume.  A+
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
This is my new holy grail product.  A few pumps of this scrunched into my hair, followed by a little arc angel gel for hold, and my curls look exactly how I like them.  My hair also seems to be less prone to dryness after using this product.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Its a little heavy (thick)  and pricey - smells good - gets used up pretty fast
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
This product does not seem authentic. It smells expired or that it may have been mixed with a cheaper product. I do not recommend.
"

My hair dresser recommended this product for daughter who has super curly mixed hair. It was not a helpful product. Rather just use Pantene as a leave in. Worked better and this product was pretty expensive compared to store brands
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
A staple in my curl routine. A notable change in my curls from the first use. Helps define curls like no other. I can tell the difference in my hair every time I skip out on this product. Yes it’s expensive but it’s 100% worth it. I’ve tried so many products and this one is a complete game changer.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I wanted to love this product but I was iffy on buying it knowing it’s for super curly hair. Sadly, it didn’t work for mine :( I have thin, wavy to half curly hair..it just made my hair greasy. I’m trying their wavy gel next! This product smells great though 😊
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I have curly hair and actually use this to keep the frizz down when I straighten it. if you use too much it will make your hair gross and oily looking but a very small amount goes a long way.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Love the product line.  Works great just as described.  Hubby ever used it for his hair which he claims he can brush out without frizz.  The price is great!  Ulta has it for double.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Great product for the price! Smells good, works wonders well.I saw other reviews where the product was delivered damaged due to poor packaging and I was concerned. Happy to see this was rectified as I received my product in tact, no spillage. Thanks!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Unless you are going from never having used product before to this, I don't think it's very impressive. I usually use Catwalk Curls and Pantene Curls Mousse and that has always worked well. Decided to give DevaCurls a try and used it without my other products. I'd say my hair was slightly curlier, but the curl didn't hold and it was very frizzy/fluffy. I definitely put enough in, so I think next time I'll add my mousse too.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
my hair is starting to loose its curls and is gradually becoming more loose waves then curly, this product has helped keep my waves a little tighter. smells great and not sticky love it!!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Second time ordering this as I loved how my hair turned out.  Used it after seeing a video appliction and liked the results.  A little goes a long way!! Smells great too! Gave 4 stars only because it was over priced.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
When I removed the container from the plastic packaging, it already had product oozing out of it. I removed the lid & the entire top came off with it. After placing the top back on, the pump doesn’t work. Very disappointing as this seller does not accept returns. Love Deva products but won’t be buying from this seller again.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I LOVE this product SO much. i wish there was a 32oz pump bottle for this. I can not & have not found anything similar to this product. My curls love love love this. I read in some reviews about acne & breaking out, I will keep an eye out for that, but so far I have not experienced any. To look at my curls Check my IG CurlsNGains :)

After buying my first round of DevaCurl products, I’ll be a lifetime buyer. It’s expensive but my curls are perfect. Woke up with all my curls looked perfect.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I have very curly, frizzy, unruly hair.  I have tried just about everything on the market and finally decided to try the Deva Curl products.  I am a new woman.  I absolutely love all of the products.  I use the no poo cleanser, conditioner, mousse and Coconut Curl Styler Cream.  My hair has never looked better.  These will be my products from now on,.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I just gave 1 star because i couldn't give it ZERO stars.  This cream does NOT work even after parting my hair to apply cream evenly.  I'm highly upset that i spent so much money for a crappy cream.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I have used this product before but decided to buy this from amazon this time. This product was horrible on my hair. I repurchased the same product, but this time, directly from Deva Curl. First day of use and my hair is already better. Not sure if this is a bad product or a counterfeit product but I significantly noticed a difference with my hair and will not buy this from amazon again. I will only buy direct from Deva Curl.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Great product and is definitely a lot cheaper if you back here on this site. Love the way it makes my hair feel.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Love it for my long, curly hair and much cheaper than the Moroccan oil curl cream I was using.  I ended up buying the shampoo and conditioner as well.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
What I liked the most it's that as soon as the hair gets dry I can see my beautiful curls. What I liked the less it's that it doesn't quite work on my hair in the front of my head, for some reason it just leaves it straight so I have to use more cream in that specific part.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Beautiful soft curls. Looks like I’m not using anything on my hair. Light shine without the processed look. Healthy!!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I don't just love this stuff, I adore it!! I used the regular Deva Curl Styling Cream for years but when this new Coconut Curl cream came out I tried it immediately and fell madly in LOVE with it. It is perfect for my wavy/curly hair and it smells AMAZING!!

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I absolutely love Deva Cream BUT twice now the bottle comes apart and doesn't work anymore, despite the fact the there's still lots of produce  left.

This is the only thing that tames my lion mane. I mid length, very wavy and frizzy hair  -  I usually go through about a bottle every 45 days and use only two pumps of product at best. This is a great price as its very more in Sephora

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I got a devacut and she recommended this product to style and I have been hooked ever since, it doesn't have a horrible smell, and it works great, works even better when you style in the shower.

Excellent for keeping my curls moisturized. It keeps my curls from frizzing, and allows me to have excellent second day curls.

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I absolutely love the Deva Curl line of products. I feel they are slightly expensive, but not as expensive as another product I used that made my hair fall out a lot in the shower. This stuff smells amazing. Feels great in my hair. I use it with the Deva Curl Set It Free. I use the Set It Free on my ends that are the driest. Recently bought my Deva Curl Towel. I love the feel and it's good for my hair! No more regular towels. Highly recommend this product.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I'm super bummed. No matter how much I use, I can't get an even coat that rights frizz consistently. It also dries out my hair.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
After years of using a product that costs 1/3 the price of DevaCurl, I decided to give this a shot due to some rave Instagram reviews. I must say I am deeply disappointed, and this is the frizziest I've ever seen my hair. I have been using the product for about a week now and am definitely going back to my old product!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Super cream is my HERO! I use this in conjunction with the Devacurl wavy line of shampoo/conditioner and Wavemaker. The Wavemaker does a good job, but even still my curls were falling limp and frizzing by the end of the day. Supercream to the rescue!!! My curls last all day (even overnight!) and they’re still soft and pliable throughout the day. Love. This. Stuff. Perfect for wavy girls who need that extra bit of oomph to boost that curl.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I've tried a good number of DevaCurl products and by far this one is my favorite for conditioning curls and styling for air drying. It's a great detangler and curl setter while keeping my hair soft and smooth with little frizz.

This product is amazing for curl definition! It's the only product I need for my curls.  Definitely a 5⭐product & shipping is fast! Will definitely order again!

My curly hair has never looked better than when I started using DevaCurl products.  Their SuperCream styler leaves my hair super moisturized and eliminates frizzy curls. Of all the hair products for curls I've used this is the brand that delivers.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Really like the product not first time buying it.  However, it was packaged with the camp folding stool and the top came loose and spilled on the stool.  I lost almost half of the product and wanted to return it but found out it was not eligible for return.  This is not a review of the product but a complaint of the packaging.
"

It smells great but does not help my curls anymore than the less expensive brands

I’ve tried many many products and have finally found my holy grail. I use this stuff everyday and don’t ever see myself switching.  I’m obsessed.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
This product is horrible. Weighed down my hair and frizzed it, didn’t even help the curls at all even if I put my hair in a bun. I wish I could get my money back. The only good thing is it smelled alright.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I've used this curl cream in the past but tried another Deva Curl product for a while. I was running low and decided to return to the cream - and I am so glad I did! My curls are bouncy, light, and happy! I can't say enough about Deva Curl and how well it handles my hair.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
5 stars! I love this product. It feels great. I apply it to my curly hair, still damp from shower, scrunch and go. Keeps the frizz down and doesn't leave any stickiness or residue. I've purchased this several times.

Product is hood but it arrived with lotion leaking out of the bottle all over the plastic wrapping
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Love the smell, I lather lots in my wet hair, it’s not sticky and it reduces frizz. I wash my hair every 3 days but in between washes I wet my hair and reapply a bit more cream.When I first apply it does look wet and crunchy. Once it dries, i fluff my hair and it looks a hell of a lot better. I also have some strays so not sure if it keeps it all together 100%.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Tried it out for the first time after YouTube reviews, OMG finally something that works for my dry curly hair leaves hair soft manageable and shapes your natural curls lovely expensive but worth it!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
The only thing I use for my curly hair. Love the cream and scent but not a fan of the new container. A little hard to pump out and I fear there will be a lot of waste when it gets below the pump. For the price I want to be able to use every last drop like their previous packaging.

Product arrived damaged-the contents of the container had leaked everywhere, leaving it unusable. A total waste of money, as the seller has a “no return” policy, so you can’t even initiate a conversation about a replacement.

I’ve been using this cream for almost two years now. It’s moisturizing and smells great. I use 1.5 to 2 squirts on my hair right out of the shower then apply a curly hair mouse or gel. I have 2C/3A curly hair that is dense, thick and course.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I’m always searching for a curl defining cream that works and doesn’t leave my curls “crunchy”. This product doesn’t do either. It didn’t add any definition to my curls and actually made them look flat. Definitely not worth the money.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I'm on the fence. I like the smell, but I feel like I need to use a lot of the product or mix it with a gel to get the holding power I need. Usually this stuff is expensive but I saw it here on Amazon for $14 so I thought I would give it another chance. Still feel the same.

I love this stuff! I have super fine curly hair that is easily weighed down into limp strands so I can't use a lot of styling products. It leaves my hair with completely natural looking curls, with no crunch or shine. Right after i started using the DevaCurl SuperCream my friends started to ask how my hair is always so curly and natural looking! I received it as a gift for Christmas about 2 years ago and I've been using it ever since.

I use it as suggested, but my hair only curls for an hour or so and then it's limp and very frizzy. There is no hold from what I can tell. Pretty disappointed considering the price. I don't like the firm hold of mousse, but haven't found one I like that isn't like that.

This product completely changed how my curls feel and look. It made me re-fall in love with my hair. I usually moisturize my curls about 3-4 times per week between my wash days,  but I only moisturize once weekly with DevaCurl. My hair never feels oily or dirty, stays smelling amazing, and is the softest it has ever been. Buy this!!!

I love this!! I’ve tried everything and mixed everything to find the perfect “cocktail” for my curls.

This is one of the only products I can add to my hair and it immediately feels moisturized. It gives  great slip once applied and is great when detangling hair.  This product doesn’t feel like it’s sitting on top of my hair, it really penetrates each strand.  The smell is also blissful!

I use this product on my fine clean curly hair after using a little of the B'Leave-In Volumizer. One pump does the trick for my chin length hair.

Love this product, works great and smells amazing also!

I normally use Natural Formula Go Curly and I tried this out because it was recommended to me. I used this once and went right back to Natural Formula. If I want defined curls I have to use SO MUCH of this and then my hair is weighed down. Do not recommend.

Love this product , it really helps my curls to not turn frizzy.

Not sure that it works that well. Smells nice, soft feel and not too heavy but doesnt seem to do much

Worked this in the night before after washing and then again in the morning to help with frizz before diffusing. Great soft curls and the coconut scent is so yummy for summer.

Helps elimate frizz and makes your hair so soft. Just use a little or it will make your hair flat.

Recently heard amazon doesn’t sell deva curl products. I got this product from deva curl and compared to two. THIS IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!! don’t waste money on this, buy the more expensive one, you’ll use way less of it!

After many years of trying different products for my frizzy hair I finally found what I’ve been looking for! I start with the Coconut Whipped Cream Leave in conditioner and then apply the DevaCurl Super Cream. This keeps my curls together and make it soft and beautiful. I’m recommending this to all of my curly haired friends!

I love this product! I got a sample long time ago and wanted to purchase it, then I lost the bottle. I got another sample and finally found the name and ordered it. I am so happy.

This cream keeps the moisture in the hair and doesn't make it dry. It brings the curves of your curls however can sometimes make the root of your hair very smooth that it falls down and doesn't give it volume.

This smells so delicious like coconuts! Very amazing for curly hair moisturizing and prefer over the styling cream comes in awesome pump bottle will definitely be purchasing again T

It’s the first time I’m trying DevaCurl products and so far I love what it does to my hair. Usually my hair gets very dry and feels hard whenever I use cream, but with this cream it stays soft, curls real nice and smells great!! Will be ordering again

It makes my hair so heavy, I have to wash my hair the next day after I use this product. It does not give any style to my curls, in fact, makes it worse!

I love Deva Curl Supercream.  I sometimes use the Deva Curl gel, but I prefer the Coconut Curl Styler.  It keeps my very curly hair in control and looking good.  I received my shipment promptly and it arrived in A+ condition.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I LOVE this product, but it is too expensive for the size of bottle. I appreciate DevaCurl and all they do for curly girls, don't get me wrong! But for the size of the bottle, I can only get about 2 months of curls and that adds up fast.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
My hair got so frizzy!  Disappointed!

Weighed my hair down too much but smells good.

Omg leaves my curls bounced & shiny! I’ve gotten so many compliments a little goes a long way!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Not amazing I think the other precut by Deva are better but this does lock in the curl and if used when hair is super wet and than lightly dried with diffuser you get good results.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Smells awesome.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I absolutely Love this product! Its incredible, smells great and does wonders for your hair. my only complaint is that the packaged arrived with the pump and entire top of the container off/disconnected. there was some spillage but I will have to dig into the container to get the product out.

I have curly hair. This product produced soft, healthy curls all the time! Love it! Great also on humid days. Will buy again!

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Okay I ordered this because of a Buzzfeed article (something I have never done before) and OMG I'm so glad I found this!! I have type 2B waves and so MULTIPLE layers of hair. The bottom layer of my hair was always frizzy and gross looking so I could never do a half-up style unless I straightened it, which is annoying. I used this for the first time today and my hair looks 1000 times better!! Seriously this is so worth it!

love this!!!!!!!

It was thicker than I anticipated for a cream. I wasn’t blown away or impressed with the product. I have bought much cheaper curl creams that worked just as good if not better.

Love this stuff! It works great on my daughter's super curly hair, but I have to use sparingly on my wavy hair so it isn't weighed down.

Nice curly cream
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I used the dash button to reorder the Deva Super Cream.  Instead of the super cream, I received the basic styling cream.  Deva has so many products with similar packaging that it is easy to mistake one for the other.  I kept it because I needed product asap.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I have naturally curly hair I apply DevaCurl to my wet hair to give me individual curls without frizz. The curls stay uniform and soft all day long. I have used this product for several years.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Very unhappy about this item. I wanted to try it out due to hearing amazing reviews. Unfortunately, it made my scalp very dry and flakey. I never had this problem until trying this product. Wanted to return and found out that it is not refundable.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
My hair has always been difficult for me when it's curly so I always use a flat iron. I have wavy curls and very thick hair and I have to use a lot of gel to keep it from getting big and poofy. I have never found a product that keeps it from being crunchy and also gives it defined bouncy curls without too much crunch. It feels natural and soft. I use the gel and cream together and can't believe how well it works. I do a little bit of drying with a diffuser and then top it off with Paul Mitchell super skinny serum.  My curls are beautiful and defined and I can finally wear it curly everyday without feeling self conscious! This stuff works like magic!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Great little cream. I use it on my mini fro when I don't feel like twisting it.I'm a black male with 4c hair

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
It's okay.  Not heavy, not crunchy.  Okay curls, but not much volume.  Feels like my hair is just hanging down

I did not see any difference to my curls
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Worked just as expected.  I have curly (permed) hair.  The product kept my hair from getting frizzy and gave it a more defined appearance.  Liked it enough that I went back and bought the fill sized product.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Extremely dissatisfied. This product not only builds up in my hair but seems to way it down also, causing less curl and volume. I wouldn't recommend nor repurchase this item. I actually ended up giving it away just to feel better about buying it.

This is pure magic. I have naturally curly hair -sometimes-. Depending on the day, weather, and how I slept on it, the curls easily fall into a wavy mess. This cream helps to encourage curls and keeps them. Have not found another product that works as well.

Great for curly/ wavy hair.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Did not work for my looser curl type. My hair frizzed when using only this product.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
After hearing many people attest to this product, I decided to try it for my curls. Sadly, it didn't work for me. It didn't give me any volume, it didn't define my curls and the product didn't hold my curl. The only thing it did was make sure my curls didn't shrink. I wouldn't purchase it again.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Love this product!! I use to have really curly hair but it’s extremely heat damaged and it’s more wavy straight now. This product definitely helps revamp my natural curl pattern.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Smells great and really hydrates my locks! The formula is a bit heavy though, so be conscious about what other products you are putting in your hair, so that your curls don't get weighed down

This product does not work either, bought both this and the Deva B' Leave In Curl Boost.......... just a farce on both items. waste of money

This is my second favorite product to use for my stubborn curls. It's a little thick but little goes a long way and it makes my curls look glossy and defined.

I have naturally curly hair and I really love the way this product tames my curls and keeps the fly aways tamed.

"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
2c/3a hair--this is a bit heavy on my hair. Do not use it on wet hair. It's fine for taming frizz on second or third day hair but I prefer spray oils over a cream that has to be applied by hand.

As a curly girl for 43 years, I’ve tried many products and home remedies for controlling the curls without drying them or looking like I put petroleum gel on my head!! This product is perfect for my hair, no drying and no extra greasy feeling either! My curls are soft and controlled and smell great!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Very unhappy with my purchase. I got both the super cream and the ultra defining gel and both look used. The super cream came with no lid and both bottles look dirty and damaged. Would 100% prefer to pay more money and buy it from their official website.

I need products that hydrate my thick  dry curls and this does the trick. I'm usually not that impressed with the DevaCurl products for my hair type, but this product works well for my particular hair which craves humectants.

Love this so hydrating and smells amazing!
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Awful.... very disappointed... does not hold at all, on the greasy/sticky side and makes my hair tangle.  I figured I would give this a shot after bed head contour cream changed their formula, thought this would be my alternate option but obviously this product is far from being great for curls!!  Don’t waste your money!

Pros: my curls were more definedCons: texture greasy but hair does not look shiny.I have acne prone skin and this product made me break out a lot. Will not purchase this product again

I've struggled to find a cream that I like but this one is awesome! I use it with my B-leave in and I get awesome results! You don't need to use a lot and it smells bomb. Also it doesn't weight my curls down. I would add an extra moisturizing leave in before because it isn't super hydrating if you have dry hair.

Magic! I don't do much styling to my hair. All I do is wet it and scrunch this stuff in. Let it dry then shake out my hair. The coconut one is a little stickier than the other style but not bad. Definitely recommend this for anyone with friz issues

Well I've bought this at a store for quite a bit more money, so I thought I'd save some and buy it on Amazon.  It works the same, which is great, for my curly hair.  However; it does not have the same wonderful coconut smell.  I wonder if the product is old?  Probably will not purchase here again.

Great moisturizing but can weight hair down if too much is used. I'm looking for volume so I'll keep using this until I find the right product that can do both!

Suuuuuuper thick. For my fine hair it's too much for me. The other cream works better for me. This smells 100% better though.

This is the best hair cream I have used. After applying this to my hair and letting it air dry (without touching) it makes my hair so soft and frizz-free. The smell is a plus too. I love the smell of coconuts. It has a hint of tanking oil too.. But in a light good way.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
This doesn't really do anything to my wavy curls. Doesn't feel moisturizing at all. If anything it actually feels like it's drying my hair and frizzy. I've heard good things about Deva and wanted to try it out because I could never find any good products for my hair type. Guess I have to keep searching.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
Great for moisturizing and soft curls.  I use it on damp and dry hair.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I already was a fan of Deva Curl products - I previously used the Deva Curl Style Cream (just the regular one) but I heard rave reviews about this Super Cream one so I decided to try it. My hair is more “wavy” than curly but I can usually get it to curl by scrunching away at it as it air dries or use a diffuser with my blow dryer.This morning I was pressed for time before work so I quickly ran this Super Cream through my hair and ran off. I randomly scrunched my hair as it air dried but not as much as I normally do. My pics aren’t the best quality due to lighting but you can see I have ringlets in my hair, which is a huge deal for me! And I barely did anything to it! I’m a believer and will surely buy more when I run out. Also, it smells divine!

This product is amazing.  I love everything about it - the smell, the lightweight formula.  Nothing negative to report except that it's pricey and sometimes you may need a lot of product to reach the desired effect.  The good thing, though, is that sometimes you just need water on day two to revive the product.

My hair is fine, between a 4b and 4c, so the Deva curl Supercream is too much for my hair, I cannot use a lot, i have to either that or the Deva curl light defining gel.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
I love this product, initially received a sample and really liked the way it left my hair. Not stiff, not greasy. Just the right amount of shine and left me with awesome ringlets.
"
"DevaCurl SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler, 5.1oz","
This definitely doesn't compare to the rest of the deva line. I use the no poo, one conditioner, ultra defining gel and set it free. This product didn't curl my 3b-3c curls at all. It left a halo of frizz around my hair that I don't get with other hair cream I use. It smells good so I gave it a 2 star. I wasn't able to return this product so to use it up I add another gel product to it to give it more hold. It doesn't have enough hold using it alone. My go to hair cream that I apply after the ultra defining gel is Curls Rock. I know it's not sulfate free, but it works on my hair and that's all that matters.

You can use it for wet and dry hair and creates less frizziness and defines your curls. For wet hair divide ur hair in sections and put cream with your fingers. For dry hair i just put a small amount all over. I use this before using the devacurl gel.

Thicker then I thought it would be for my type of hair and leaves it a bit greasy.

BEWARE OF COUNTERFEITS!  I've been using DevaCurl hair gel for 10 years and love the way it looks great from day one to day five, and even holds up for a couple of days in humid weather. I've been buying from different sources, including Amazon. This time I ordered from a company called Gold Fulfillment. For some reason the gel just didn't work. Only the ends of my hair were a bit stiff, and by the next day it was as if I'd used no product whatsoever. I kept trying since this has always been a wonderful product, and kept slathering on more. Finally I called the manufacturer to see if they had changed the formula. They said that the formula is the same, but they've been getting complaints from people who've bought on Amazon. Apparently somebody is adulterating or counterfeiting this product. Oops! They said to be sure to only buy from authorized resellers, so I checked out my other supplier and they're on the list.  This is very upsetting, since I buy a huge amount of stuff on Amazon, and rely on the reviews to make good choices, and also appreciate the integrity of Amazon itself. I have had only good experiences with their system, and would hate to see trust destroyed by counterfeit products. And this is hair gel, for #**@# (crying out loud), it's not like needing to be careful buying an expensive electronic item.  So curly girls, here's a heads up to keep those curls on your head gorgeous!. We know how dependent we are on our hair products, we curlies spend more on hair products than anybody else. DevCurl makes great stuff, I'm hooked, just have to check out the suppliers.

Ladies! Ladies! Ladies! (and Gentleman) You CANNOT and i mean cannot go wrong with this gel! I have type 4 hair - 4a ish in the back in my “kitchen” and 4b everywhere else. Now with this being said my wash and goes gotta be on point and it did just that! This officialy replaced my wash and go with my eco styler. My curls are popping and looking juicy! However just beware that if you have thick LONG hair this “trial travel size” aint for you! See here’s the secret - go to bed bath and beyond and they have the no name brand and catch is, they both have the same ingredients so one youre saving money and getting the product.The bottle i got was $11.99 for a 12 oz while this was $10 for 3oz which sounds crazy! Anywho i did my wash n go in the shower with a amazing non foggy mirror (also from bb&b) and did a slicing method (put product in your hands and slap your hair in between and slide down) and boom! Curls Poppington!Go getchu some!

Hate to give this a 1 star. The product is normally 5 stars. Buy this product from the DevaCurl site NOT Amazon. My wife uses DevaCurl and loves it. She found it here on Amazon for $14 cheaper so she bought it here. Apparently it's a knock off one. She went back to the one from DevaCurl themselves and her hair came out ""perfect"" as she says. Next day, she used the one from Amazon and says ""it's crap! I would have been better off not using any product today.""Yes, buying from DevaCurl site is slightly more money but well worth it because that way you actually get real product not some knock off with god only knows what's really in it!!

When I first applied it I was not happy because my hair became so hard and it gave me flashbacks of my cheap La Looks gel days. Well I looked at tips on youtube and they recommend your hair be fully wet. So instead of using a spray bottle I put my head under the sink. Applied gel while hair was damp and when it dried it looked and felt great. I will continue buying this product. I don't like their prices but the products are magical

"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I thought I had wavy hair until I used this product. I hated that my waves never looked good despite using different products so I flat ironed my hair for 10 years. After using this on my sisters recommendation I found I actually have curly hair. Since buying this 8 months ago I haven't touched a flat iron. I apply to my damp hair, let it air dry, then quickly diffuse my roots with a blow dryer. Best product for curls, hands down. Will never use another product again.
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I know others swear by this gel, but I have reservations about it.  I will admit with a wash and go, including diffusing my wet wavy hair,  my hair did look perfect.  It had shine, bounce and wicked waves.  I was very happy.  The problem I had came the day after.  My hair was hard, tangled,  dry and looked nothing like the day before, even after putting my hair up at night before going to bed and using a satin pillow!  The 3rd day was even worse, and so on.  Every day I had to totally wet my hair and using the LOC method but using a different curly girl product.  I couldn't wait to wash my hair again. I will give it to Deva Curl that maybe I used too much gel, but I don't think so.  IMO
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I would give this 0 stars if I could. I've been using Deva products for awhile and decided to invest in a large bottle. First of all, this smells NOTHING like the genuine product. I had some left over of an old bottle I purchased from the salon, and they smell completely different. The consistency is even different. Really disappointed.

"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I'm Caucasian with frizzy, loose curly hair and I have NEVER found a product that works as well as this one.  Follow the directions & put in very wet hair & when it's dry break it up & it works amazingly. I don't find the product to have much of a sent at all...especially when my hair dries.  Seriously though, if you're debating on whether or not to get this, do it. It's pricey but worth it!
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Sorry to tell you ladies, this seems different because it is.  I have been using Deva products since 2005 when I first moved to NYC and visited the original salon on Broadway in Soho.  I know for a fact that the product has changed, along with all Deva products.  When the company was bought out, everything changed.  The good news is, the original owner / founder is about to launch her own line, which will stick to the simple, few ingredients like the good old days.  In the meantime, if anyone has a recommendation for a great, mostly natural gel that doesn't leave my curls dry and knotty like this  does, do tell!

DevCurl makes great stuff, I'm hooked, just have to check out the suppliers.

Ladies! Ladies! Ladies! (and Gentleman) You CANNOT and i mean cannot go wrong with this gel! I have type 4 hair - 4a ish in the back in my “kitchen” and 4b everywhere else. Now with this being said my wash and goes gotta be on point and it did just that! This officialy replaced my wash and go with my eco styler. My curls are popping and looking juicy! However just beware that if you have thick LONG hair this “trial travel size” aint for you! See here’s the secret - go to bed bath and beyond and they have the no name brand and catch is, they both have the same ingredients so one youre saving money and getting the product.The bottle i got was $11.99 for a 12 oz while this was $10 for 3oz which sounds crazy! Anywho i did my wash n go in the shower with a amazing non foggy mirror (also from bb&b) and did a slicing method (put product in your hands and slap your hair in between and slide down) and boom! Curls Poppington!Go getchu some!

Hate to give this a 1 star. The product is normally 5 stars. Buy this product from the DevaCurl site NOT Amazon. My wife uses DevaCurl and loves it. She found it here on Amazon for $14 cheaper so she bought it here. Apparently it's a knock off one. She went back to the one from DevaCurl themselves and her hair came out ""perfect"" as she says. Next day, she used the one from Amazon and says ""it's crap! I would have been better off not using any product today.""Yes, buying from DevaCurl site is slightly more money but well worth it because that way you actually get real product not some knock off with god only knows what's really in it!!

When I first applied it I was not happy because my hair became so hard and it gave me flashbacks of my cheap La Looks gel days. Well I looked at tips on youtube and they recommend your hair be fully wet. So instead of using a spray bottle I put my head under the sink. Applied gel while hair was damp and when it dried it looked and felt great. I will continue buying this product. I don't like their prices but the products are magical

I thought I had wavy hair until I used this product. I hated that my waves never looked good despite using different products so I flat ironed my hair for 10 years. After using this on my sisters recommendation I found I actually have curly hair. Since buying this 8 months ago I haven't touched a flat iron. I apply to my damp hair, let it air dry, then quickly diffuse my roots with a blow dryer. Best product for curls, hands down. Will never use another product again.

I know others swear by this gel, but I have reservations about it.  I will admit with a wash and go, including diffusing my wet wavy hair,  my hair did look perfect.  It had shine, bounce and wicked waves.  I was very happy.  The problem I had came the day after.  My hair was hard, tangled,  dry and looked nothing like the day before, even after putting my hair up at night before going to bed and using a satin pillow!  The 3rd day was even worse, and so on.  Every day I had to totally wet my hair and using the LOC method but using a different curly girl product.  I couldn't wait to wash my hair again. I will give it to Deva Curl that maybe I used too much gel, but I don't think so.  IMO

I would give this 0 stars if I could. I've been using Deva products for awhile and decided to invest in a large bottle. First of all, this smells NOTHING like the genuine product.

I'm Caucasian with frizzy, loose curly hair and I have NEVER found a product that works as well as this one.  Follow the directions & put in very wet hair & when it's dry break it up & it works amazingly. I don't find the product to have much of a sent at all...especially when my hair dries.  Seriously though, if you're debating on whether or not to get this, do it. It's pricey but worth it!

Sorry to tell you ladies, this seems different because it is.  I have been using Deva products since 2005 when I first moved to NYC and visited the original salon on Broadway in Soho.  I know for a fact that the product has changed, along with all Deva products.  When the company was bought out, everything changed.  The good news is, the original owner / founder is about to launch her own line, which will stick to the simple, few ingredients like the good old days.  In the meantime, if anyone has a recommendation for a great, mostly natural gel that doesn't leave my curls dry and knotty like this  does, do tell!

My hair has always been difficult for me when it's curly so I always use a flat iron. I have wavy curls and very thick hair and I have to use a lot of gel to keep it from getting big and poofy. I have never found a product that keeps it from being crunchy and also gives it defined bouncy curls without too much crunch. It feels natural and soft. I use the gel and cream together and can't believe how well it works. I do a little bit of drying with a diffuser and then top it off with Paul Mitchell super skinny serum.  My curls are beautiful and defined and I can finally wear it curly everyday without feeling self conscious! This stuff works like magic!

This product is great at giving defined curls without a hard crunchy finish.  I recommend combining it with a hair lotion to provide hold and touchable texture of natural hair. I used it right out of the shower when my hair was still damp/wet.  I flipped my hair over, scrunched it with about a quarter sized amount (I have medium length hair) and then put my hair up in a turbie twistie.  Slept on it overnight... in the AM I let it down to air dry the rest of the way.

this gel is literally my new curly hair staple. i started my curly hair journey last summer after straightening my hair every single day, and my hair was dead. it was very hard for me finding products that were actually good for hair and after six months of using ms jessies pillow soft curls, i have switched to a routine consisting of the devacurl decadence line for shampoo and conditioner, the curls blueberry bliss leave in ( which makes my hair feel like silk ), the devacurl supercream, and this gel. and let me tell you, this gel makes your curls last for up to five days. when i was using miss jessies, my hair could barely last a day. this gel has a little crunch while it is drying, but once you shake it out you get the most delicate and soft curls. it smells really nice and doesn’t flake or dry out hair either. thank god for devacurl!

Similar to previous comments I bought this thinking it was going to be the original formula. Unfortunately this product is not the real one you buy at ULTA. The hair ends up getting super hard and the formula is extra sticky. I bought the bottle from ulta, it looks the same, but it does not work the same. I am unsure as to the reason but I will pay $40 from now on in order to get the real product.

I ordered this product based on several but not all reviews listed.  I can't believe anyone would be happy with the results of this gel from DevaCurl.  My hair is naturally curly/wavy with a lot of potential frizz if I don't use styling or finishing products.  I don't use a hair dryer because it can be drying to my hair enhancing the fluff and frizz.  However, with that said my hair is soft to the touch.  I have never had such dry hair in my life as when I used this DevaCurl gel product and air dried.  I used it on 2 occasions, the result was dry untouchable hair and I won't continue using this product.  Whatever you do, don't waste your money on this gel product.On a lighter note I did purchase the DevaCurl styling creme from a salon and had wonderfully improved results with soft well formed curls and no frizz especially when applied to wet hair.

Going into this i thought it was going to leave my hair hard, and nasty, so i was a little bit skeptical but after watching a review on youtube, I absolutely love this! It DOES NOT leave my hair crunchy or hard like other gels that've gotten before. Its probably the best thing that has happened to my hair. It does emphasize my natural waves that i already have.I just grab a little while my hair is still wet, and scrunch it into the ends of my hair, then i get a little more and scrunch it into the roots of my hair, and it leaves it perfect!

The most amazing product for curly hair I’ve ever tried. I couldn’t recommend more for anyone with wavy or curly hair. It makes my hair much curlier than its ever been able to be with any other products - creating lots of ringlets that normally wouldn’t form. It gives my hair volume and definition without being crunchy or too stiff. It’s also so moisturizing - even after days in my hair, I wash it out and it’s not at all dry feeling - it actually feels more moisturized which is the opposite of what any other product would’ve done in the past. I use it with the curl cream and it’s just perfect. I couldn’t be happier.

How do I buy a vat of this stuff? Since I was 12 my hair has been a shapeless puff of fuzz. Not straight, not wavy, not curly. Just thick and frizzy. I have tried lots of products over the years in an attempt to give my hair form and most of the time I'm left with a crunchy mess. There is absolutely no stiffness with this. My hair feels so soft now and smells like the organic soap aisles at the store. AND look at my beachy waves! Seriously, I haven't had a good hair day in a long time. I needed this.

I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks.  I so want to like it. My hair is wavy/curly, thick, just above shoulder length. I find the scent of DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel lovely and it's fun to use. Gives a wonderful shine to my hair. As far as creating curl...I guess my hair is the wrong type for this. It gives my hair volume, makes the really curly part more curly, but the wavy part is odd from the gel...tangled and frizzy. I definitely have to use a curling iron/flat iron to create style, which seems opposite of what this product should do. I also tried the lighter gel and had the same results. I'm going to use the gel for root volume; hopefully that's the benefit I'll receive from it.

My favorite Curly Girl approved gel.  I have type 2b/2c curls and this one just does it for me above others I’ve tried.  I use it after I’ve turned my shower off and have applied a leave-in conditioner (I usually use just a regular conditioner as a leave-in).  I scrunch out the excess water as much as I can, then apply quite a lot of this gel, scrunching it in and squeezing out more excess water in the process.  Then I use a microfiber towel to scrunch out more moisture then “plop” with it for about fifteen minutes.  Scrunching out as much moisture as possible before, during, and after applying the gel really helps with setting my curl pattern for the day and speeds up drying time considerably.  I usually air dry or sometimes diffuse.  When my hair is completely dry, I break the gel cast by “scrunching out the crunch.”  All of this leaves my hair soft and bouncy without weighing it down.  I’ve tried other CG approved gels, but this one works for me and my routine.  Other types of curls might have different results.  If you are just starting the curly girl method, good luck and your hair will thank you.

I finally found my product! I live in Coastal Georgia where there is a lot of humidity. My hair does not frizz with this product. I also don't wash my hair very often and the gel will last through to my next wash without reapplying. I can put my hair in a bun and let it or without any scrunchy creases. Worth the price. My hair is very soft and not crunchy at all. I receive a lot of compliments on my hair now. I apply this in layers, that is the key. No diffuser necessary.

I love deva products. However this is not real deva. I used to work for a professional beauty supply store but after having my child I gave up the job. Ive always been told never to buy professional products like this online because there is a chance of tampering. Well sure enough and despite the good reviews...this was clearly not real deva product. This was very watery and had almost no hold. Caused my hair to feel dry and look frizzy. Even in my daughters super super curly hair was frizzy and felt dry. I have some real deva curl light holding gel and it worked way better and had way befter definition than this. Save your time and money. Do not buy this.

Since flat ironing my curly hair for too long, I thought I had totally lost my natural curl. Or it was a product of age - or possibly both. I've tried very expensive curly hair products, drug store brands, you name it. Then I found this. It is amazing. Never crunchy or stiff, never sticky, and if you follow the directions you get beautifully defined curl or wave. I'm even hoping my corkscrew curls might return one day.Pay no mind to the user name, I'm a female with shoulder-length hair, purchased this on my husband's Amazon account.

I can no longer trust this brand. I would regularly wash with sulfates and use this product after to use as a gel cast over my hair. I started to noticed dermatitis spots all over my back, inside/behind my ears, and around my scalp. Anything my hair would regularly come into contact with caused itching/burning to other people in my household. I started to develop cystic acne, something I've never had before. As soon as I discontinued use all of these symptoms went away within a few weeks. My hair was left dry, brittle, and the curl pattern went from 2b curls to wavy/straight. My hair is half as thick as it used to be, and I'm noticing bald spots at the sides and a receding hairline. Please use this product with caution. If you notice ANY of these symptoms as I've mentioned, please discontinue use IMMEDIATELY.

i have been going through a lot of different creams and puddings for my hair.  just discovered the devacurl line and the no poo movement and finally figured out that my 3a needs a gel to help set up the curl.  i love this gel and the smell is great.  i recommend that you check out books on curly hair to see what type you had and then match up your products to your type.  i also recommend using just conditioner to wash and a leave in to condition.  this has been working for me so far.

DevaCurl offers the best products I've found for my naturally curly hair.  My regimen has been tremendously simplified.  I used to practically have a chemistry lab of hair products, and would mix and match them in different ways.  Now I wash my hair with Devacurl No-Poo and use the Ultra Defining Gel after towel-drying my hair.  No conditioner needed!  No other goops or lotions to apply, unless I want to feel like a mad scientist.  It's magic stuff.  I've never received so many compliments on my hair as I have since using DevaCurl.  It also helps that the Ultra Defining Gel gets a score of 4 and No-Poo gets a 2 on the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep database!No one gave me any items free in exchange for an honest (or other) review -- but I wish they had.

Started buying Deva products through our stylist, then through Ulta to be able to get the reward points.  I was hesitant to buy online because I'd seen some reviews about Deva products being watered-down, but the gel we purchased came in exactly the same consistency as the bottles we've purchased in-person through Ulta and at the salon.  The savings far outweigh any reward program at the beauty store, so we will definitely be purchasing our Deva shampoo, conditioner and gel through here in the future.

I was so excited to try this product after seeing so many positive reviews. Unfortunately, I did not have the same experience as most people. I bought the smallest bottle because it was pricey and I did not want to spend too much without trying it first. I followed the instructions, but because of the size of the bottle, I did not use too much. No product has ever made my curls look so ugly. It is somehow even worse than when I leave my curls alone. Once I decided I was not happy with the product, I decided that maybe the problem was how little I used it, so the second day I applied the product liberally.... My curls looked better but by the time my hair dried, my curls looked frizzy and matted. I do not at all recommend this product. People have always complimented my curls when I'm using products such as John Freda or even Suave (cause sometimes I'm broke!!) but both days I wore this product, I had people asking me what was wrong with my curls. It's a bad sign when your husband ask you ""did you go to work looking like that?!""

I was skeptical of this stuff. I do not spend money on myself, especially $30 for a hair product I've never tried before. But omg I'm so glad I did! I have actual curls now instead of stringy waves. It does dry my hair out kind of after 2 weeks, so I take a day off once every 2 weeks and just use a leave-in (Shea moisture). I was so nervous using a GEL but it works wonders and once you scruch out the crunch, you're left with soft, gorgeous curls!

I’ve used this product for years. There’s no way they did not change the formula. In recent months, I noticed a change in the look and feel of the product. I didn’t think anything of it. However, I wish I had. Deva curl products have ruined my hair. It’s as if they put relaxing chemicals in their products. Some strands of my very curly hair have become completely straight while others have just loosened. It has also changed the texture of my hair. I am mortified. I saw that people were speaking out but didn’t stop using their products because I didn’t see a change in my own hair but I trusted them too much and now my hair is damaged. Even if you haven’t seen a change in your hair, please stop using these products. It’s not worth it to wait and see if it will ruin your hair too.

My hair with no product is wavy & very frizzy.  This product did put more curl in my hair which is why I gave it 2 stars but it did nothing to help with the frizz. For the expensive price I was expecting it to help with the frizz too & was hoping it would be the only product I would need to use.  I tried putting the gel on as soon as I got out of the shower while my hair was still very wet & before I put on the towel & I tried putting it on after I had my hair wrapped in my towel while putting on makeup.

I have thick coarse wavy, sometimes curly hair (think of coochie hair on the head).  This product isn't all it's cracked up to be. It didn't keep my hair from frizzing after it dried. Once it dries, it leaves this funky feel to your hair and forget capping or wrapping your hair, sleeping and waking with something manageable or pretty because I haven't. God forbid if you brush it.

I am a gel junkie. I tend to use Eco Styler with great results but was looking to try a softer gel to reduce the crunchiness of my hair. This gel dired out my hair with ZERO definition and very little hold. I do not recommend. I tried using less, and I tried using more. Now to use it up, I use it to hold twists in place when I'm protective styling - and even then, I can tell by how my twists feel that my hair is completely dehydrated.

I have thick, long, wavy hair that's in-between the wavy and curly side. This product is ok, but I found that it easily gets my hair into almost irreparable knots if I'm not careful. It gives a nice hold, but if you aren't careful with your timing of when you put it on, you can just end up making your hair look messy. It's not bad enough for me to quit using the bottle, but I'm not sure I'll purchase again,I've read a lot of positive reviews, but maybe this isn't for my hair type.On the plus, this bottle has lasted me FOREVER and, while it may seem like a big purchase, a lot less gets you a lot farther and you;ll probably save money in the end.

I use this along with the DevaCurl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam as a finishing touch for fly aways after using a diffuser. My hair doesn't curl very well with using the gel wet and allowing to air dry like the instructions suggest on the bottle.

I put it on while my hair is still wet - before towel drying - and let my hair dry naturally or use a diffuser.

I followed all product directions and tutorials on the Devacurl website and nothing I tried gave me my natural curls back. I returned the product and went with my tried and true - B'leav-in. It gives me the volume and definition, minus the crunch that never really went away even after I broke the cast with the ultra defining gel. If you're struggling with this product, try the other instead.

Very well pack to prevent leaking. I initially thought I'd be returning or selling this product after the trying it twice and not getting the results I'd expected. Then while complaining about it I happened to glance at the instructions. SO HAPPY I DID. Keeping my hair saturated as opposed to towel drying it before apply made a TREMENDOUS difference. Not only for the day. I no longer have bushy bed head when I wake in the morning. More than pleased. ELATED.

This product is the worst product I have ever put on my hair. I, like most people, go off of reviews to make an informed decision on what products I choose to buy, and I have never been more disappointed.I bought this product a while back, (September 2019), and from the first use I noticed that it made my hair feel rough and wiry. I thought maybe it was the shampoo or other products I was using because over 2,000 good reviews couldn’t be wrong. Fast forward to December 2019, this DevaCurl product has made more damage to my hair than Anything else I’ve ever used.Damage done by this product; rough, dry, brittle, wiry hair, and density loss.It is now February 2020, since not using this product my hair has had significant improvements.

This was my first time trying deva curls for myself and my kids, My curl pattern is a 2b and my kids are a 3b-c. Works incredibly well in both of my kids curls, defines without making them crunchy. Didn’t do as much for my curls, Might be a little too heavy for curls in the 2a-c range. Def works best if applied to hair while really wet, and it smells SO GOOD! Next time I’ll buy the bigger size since it works so well for both of my kids curls! I should also note I used it along with coconut creme.

So this gel has some pros and cons. Pros: it smells nice. I love the amount of product you get (its huge!) And the pump is great.Cons: the gel is too light for my hair. No matter how much product I use I cant get enough definition and my hair frizzes within a few hours. For this reason alone I feel that it is much too pricey of a gel that doesn't even define or hold.

This left a texture similar to if I had applied regular hair gel through my strands. My hair appeared kind of crunchy and wet all day until I brushed it out, which make it look like I hadn't put any product in at all. Using less product didn't resolve this issue either. While I don't have super curly hair, I do have defined waves that need frizz taming, but this product just didn't do it for me. I guess it's good that the product size is so small so I won't feel so bad about wasting the rest. Oh well

My hair is a combination of type 2C and 3A; my hair is thick, coarse and no porous. I gave this product a year so allow type my hair to adapt to it. This product doesn't work for me. It doesn't provide hold(nothing: no light hold, no hold at all). I used the entire line and it let my hair to air dry, after my hair dries it looks frizzy, and brittle. There is no way I can get a second day when using this product, I have to completely wet my hair and start all over again.

The Ultra Defining Gel is not what it used to be. I used to be able to use it in my hair and go days without washing it, just use the One Conditioner and reapply the gel, but the product leaves much more of a residue/stickiness to my hair.. I will be switching to a new product line, because I have been hearing things about the quality of their products going downhill. Such a shame, since I had thought I'd found a product that I would use for life. I tried to post a review to the DevaCurl website, but after I clicked ""Submit"" and went back to look for my review, there are only 5 star reviews there. Shady shady...

I have short, thick, curly and frizzy hair. I used a quarter size amount of gel to hold my curls in place. At first it worked great. I liked how lightweight the gel felt on my hair and it didn't crimp like other gel products do. But the gel didn't hold up well in the humidity. My hair was still frizzy and I would add more gel to fix it, but I didn't like how my scalp felt with the product build up. I might try the brand again but with a stronger gel.

If you love Devs Curl gel, this is a good deal. The pump works really well and makes application on wet hair a breeze, as you don't have to pick up the bottle. I keep one in my shower for wash days and one in my room for refreshing. It was worth the money to have one of my favorite products right where I need it! The pump helps me use the perfect amount too, so it is lasting longer than if it was just in a regular bottle.

So i tried rhe light defining gell and 8t worked okay on my 3a/b hair but this works sooo much better at defining my hair and it actually last the hole day! The bottle size it pretty good right now (i just cut my hair to my shoulders) overall really good product. Bit on the pricey side but since i dont use that many products its not too bad

I love this line. It really works will with the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream.*****UPDATE 3.21.18*****So.. though this line is amazing and it really does define your curls. I would recommend using the cream first and then the gel. The gel really dries your hair out so if you need extra moisture definitely use the cream first then the gel then possibly another cream after. Then when you toss your hair after air drying, make sure to toss with an oil or anti frizz to help with the dryness.

Absolutely LOVE this product! For years I hated my curly hair because it would always frizz up and have that awkward wave look to it. But for the past year or so I decided to stop using heat on my hair so I not only would have healthier hair but to try and grow it out pretty long. This has been my saving grace! When using this I have beautifully defined curls and no frizz! To top it off my hair stays very soft and flowy. I will be using this as my forever hair product and will recommend this to whoever I know has curly hair. ☺

LOVE this gel. I have curl hair and have tried practically everything. This product comes at a slight premium but I think it's well worth it. I put it in at night after I wash my hair and let it hair dry. I wake up in the morning, scrunch my hair a bit and I'm good to go. The curls look great and they last all day. I have it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it helped a little more with frizziness.

I works great to define my curls. I have porous wavy/curly natural hair. I use this gel in my routine after I have sealed my curls with Shea Butter and scrunched with a light amount of Kinky Curly Curling Custard. The custard provides the hold but this gel makes the curls come out. A little goes a long way. It is water soluble is not sticky at all. A bottle lasts a really long time. I would recommend this gel to all the curly girls I know.

I've gotta agree with the other curlies on here. This actually does work. I have really fine but thick hair. The trick really is letting it dry ALL THE WAY before you tousle your hair, otherwise it can look a little limp. If you follow the directions if wont be crunchy. Enjoy!

I wanted to love this product to the moon and back, but I just can't. However, I will definitely be trying other DevaCurl products.This particular one made my hair feel very heavy and very oily the entire time it was on my hair.

I have to use a lot more of this one compared to the same gel I purchase at Ulta, so while it’s cheaper I think it’s watered down or something, you end up using more, might as well go to the store and pay full price. Smells good as always though.
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I just bought this about a week ago. My hair is naturally curly but this gives it the 'oomph' it needs to make it a kinky curly. I don't use the amount the directions indicate on the bottle. I use about 6-7 pumps because I have long and a lot of hair. This is why I bought the 32 oz considering I use a lot product. Once I feel I have enough gel and have scrunched up to my roots, I use a microfiber towel to dry the excess water and let it air dry. I absolutely love this product and will be buying again once I run out, which will be soon. :'(

I have being using the product and noticed that my curls are much curlier than before.  If I want a more defined look, then I put more but if I want a more natural look I apply less.

It was a let down for me. My go-to gel is Ecostyler Argan Oil and that leaves my hair soft and shiny as well as great hold for 3-4 days which is amazing because I go to the gym 5 days a week. From other reviews I thought the DevaCurl was going to be even more amazing but I found it went on while watery, dried leaving a sticky and crunchy texture and gave me 1 day hold. I've already given it away. I'm very disappointed in this product.

OK, this stuff is great!  First of all - it's vegan, so how great is that?  Not tested on animals either! (GO Devacurl!) I have fine, curly hair and it gets frizzy really easily.  I have medium length hair and I use a bit the size of a small bean.  I scrunch my hair with it and it really helps to keep my ends together and lessen the frizz.  A light pick softens it and my curls look great.  I really love this stuff!

I'm trying to get away from using hairspray, so purchasing this gel i was trying to see if my hair would still frizz at the ends and sides or would it really hold my curls and last all day.

I bought this product after my Deva hair stylist used it on me with amazing results. I was so happy that using I was able to achieve the same results at home with this gel. My curls are defined and last for days. Just make sure to use plenty of gel (more then you think you need) on super wet dry, then ""scrunch out the crunch"" once dried.

This might be the only hair styling product I've used that actually does what it says it'll do. I've been using DevaCurl products for a few years now, but I was styling my hair with the cream instead of the gel. I've always been wary of gel products because I hate the crunchy hair look, but this gel leaves your curls soft and defined. If you have curls from root to tip like I do, this will help them keep their shape all day long. The cream just didn't have the hold I needed, but this gel definitely does. Highly recommend it!

This was a gift for my daughter.  I was excited to find such a large bottle at a great price.  However, after being delivered to the wrong address and making it's way to me in it's crushed box, I opened it to find a Large bottle filled with clear gel and no label.  It appears to be a knock-off.  I also, can not give this as a gift because it looks very cheap without the label.  No indication of what is in the bottle.  I will not be purchasing DevaCurl products via Amazon anymore.

This is my favorite gel ever. I wish I had this in the 80's! Make sure to keep it in the shower and apply to soaking wet hair. It will feel hard once it dries, but softens as you scrunch and release your curls. I apply a cream over the top of the gel.

Quite possibly the worst thing I've ever put in my hair.  I was looking for more body, and haven't had an issue with my curls being frizzy or unmanageable.  I used this and suddenly I look like the Lion from the Wizard of OZ.  I'll stick to Carol's Daughter.Way too flaky, sticky residue, fragrance, and made hair super dry.

This product cannot possibly be real...I can't picture devacurl making something that basically ruins your curls instead of improving them. This gel dries your hair out and makes your curls flat and straight. It makes my hair feel worse than a brillo pad. Please save yourself the hassle and buy only from the devacurl site.

Perfect! Switched from Aveda Confixor liquid gel which was way too sticky and left my curls crunchy. The devalcurl ""ultra"" defining gel is just right with defining the curl and keeping the freeze to a minimum. I have yet to try the devalcurl light defining gel... Would say this is a must if you live in a humid climate like we have in North Carolina.

REVIEW UPDATE: It was suggested that I try this gel on soaking wet hair and I must say that made a huge difference!  I put a full palm fulls in while still in the shower, wrapped my head in a microfiber towel for about 15 minutes and then gently finger combed my hair and added a little more gel where needed. I now have clumpy ringlets which is what I like.  I upped the rating to 4 stars.  This may be my go to gel now :)Downside = I found this gel to be just OK - it's holding power wasn't as strong as I had hoped for.  I have super thick 2c/3a hair and I need a harder holding gel.  I think it would work better for someone with wavy hair.  Upside = It smells divine.

Works like a charm! Trying to embrace my natural curl/wave. I did my research and after a couple of other gels, tried this. It defines the ""s-curve"" nicely and beautiful after scrunching to give my hair a very pretty naturally curly look. Doesn't dry out my hair either!

I wish I could give this item no stars at all because it is not real DevaCurl. The consistency is cheap and not moisturizing whatsoever.

Once my hair is completely dry, I scrunch with my hands to ""release"" the stiffness of the gel.  I'm left with perfect, frizz-free curls all day.

Sadly for me, it does not feel moisturizing at all and it leaves my hair looking AND feeling dry.

I've tried a lot of deva curl products. The shampoos and conditioners do not work for me. Honestly, Garnier's Curl Nourish line works better for me and is way cheaper.But I can't find anything better to style my curls with on a daily basis than this gel (which does not look at all like crunchy once your hair dries).

I swear by deva curl products, I have had super curly hair my whole life and had always had a problem with the curls looking flat or frizzy.

Works well on my thick, wavy hair. This was recommended by a friend whose curls looked great. I ordered it right away. The first time I used it, I was pleased with the good shape and frizz control, and the spirally waves in my long hair. Not a greasy look or feel at all, my hair feels soft to touch. This is at the height of a hot, humid summer. I expect in winter I can use the same gel, just less of it.

My curls have never been so define and lasted so long without friz before. Out of all the curl defining jells and creams I've used this one leaves no residue behind.

First time using deva curl and I had high hopes. I have medium length natural curly red hair. It didn't leave my hair with soft curls but crunchy curls especially on my ends. It did hold my curls well for about 3 hours then got very poofy. Felt like I could of bought a cheap moose to get the same result that it left me. Crunchy is not what my hair is used to and not a good look. Will try it again with some of my normal styling products and hopefully achieve that beautiful deva curl look I've read and seen so much.

leaves hair crunchy , but what i did was put some coconut oil first and then just a tiny bit of this hair gel, and i will go ahead and use it, but it is not really what i wanted, i prefer the bleave in.

Everyone's curly hair needs are different, but this is the best stuff for my personal kind of very curly, but somewhat fine, hair.  It doesn't weigh it down, but keeps curl consistency and integrity while reducing frizz and unpredictability.  And no crunch!  Hair soft to the touch!  I used to use Ouidad's gel, but it was a little too heavy for me.  Like with Goldilocks, this product is JUST RIGHT for my hair's needs.

"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I don't know how I lived without this gel. Highly recommend using in conjunction with no poo and one condition. Apply to soaking wet hair in the shower, scrunch then use a microfiber towel to absorb the excess water. Don't touch it again until it's completely dry then shake curls from the root and scrunch to break the gel cast. It leaves my curls so defined and full of volume!
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Awesome product. It's a little pricier than drugstore products, but creates amazing curl definition in my wavy/curly hair. Note that it's supposed to create a curl cast that you then ""break"" when you hair dries by scrunching--so if you hair feels crunchy, and is dry, try crunching it to release That cast!

I have B3 type hair and I absolutely love this gel! My hair doesn't have any ""crunchy"" feel to it nor does it flake after days of having it in. I'm also finding my hair has so much more curl to it because the product doesn't weigh down my curls in any way. I also loveeee that it doesn't leave a sticky residue on my hands from playing with my hair throughout the day. I went from using 2-3 products to style my hair to using ONLY this gel. I highly recommend it!

I've used this product for a long time and always purchased it at local stores. I recently realized that buying this size is much cheaper and lasts longer.

I've tried a bevy of products for my hair. I had hopes for this product, but it does exactly what I don't want gels to do.  I have naturally curly hair which tends to be dry already and this gel just dried my hair out more.  It also gave me that 1980's ""wet look"" hair of my adolescence, which I hate.  I really regret buying this product because it was expensive and now I don't intend to use it ever again.

I've been using this for a long time. And, I have liked it for a long time. Recently I bought a wig because my hair is thinning very badly and my curls are just not the curls they used to be. I still wash with No-Poo,and conditioning with One Condition, but I have been leaving out this gel. Drying it I have not been caring/careful to maintain the curls. TO MY SURPRISE, my hair feels softer and the curls are fuller. Still thinning, but I like my hair better without this gel.

The product is amazing.  I have a lot of skepticism when it comes to buying products for my hair.  I used to just let it hair dry, but it would turn out extremely frizzy and corse.  This product was reccommended to me by my roommate and also one of my other friends who have curly hair and I was very impressed.  Not only does it make my hair feel silky smooth it also makes my hair smell amazing afterwards.

Ok, so I was cautiously optimistic about this product due to past disappointments with other curl defining products. But boy, I'm glad I took the chance and ordered this, because it's amazing! I have frizzy/wavy hair that tries to curl, but never succeeds. I followed the instructions closely, applied the gel and waited for my hair to dry. After it dried, it was CRUNCHY. I was a little worried, but I flipped my hair and gently tussled it and re-scrunched it. When I flipped upright, there was no more crunch and my hair had beautiful volume!!I'm sold!!

My favorite gel from the DevaCurl line -- this one has a stronger hold than other gels, which I need for my hair type. I keep this bad boy in the shower and apply right after. Having the pump is so helpful. The price is right on -- if you use this stuff as much as I do, it's definitely worth it (and a better deal money-wise) to get the big one!

I was overly excited to try out this product, but I'm pretty disappointed with how this made my hair feel. After applying to my hair, I noticed that it made my hair feel dry and brittle. I tried using after a leave-in conditioning cream which helped a lot, but I'm still disappointed with how it turned out. Not to mention, my curls weren't as coily and bouncy as promised.

Just got this today. Took a shower and styled my hair with this gel. Was very skeptical,  but followed the suggested use instructions and I am SO pleased. I have curly hair ,but had it cut short (stacked bob) for the winter because I blow it out. Suffice to say, I've been wearing my hair up for months because my hair is in that awkward growth stage.

Wonderful light styling gel for curly hair.  Almost weightless and it holds all day. It also last forever. I don't use the full amount rec commended because a little goes a long way for me. My stylist told me to use a huge amount and it totally weighed my hair down, not necessary.  Great product!!

I love my ultra defining gel. It gives my curls this amazing shape and shine without having to layer on product after product. The gel does leave a cast sometimes, but honestly it's nothing a good shake doesn't get rid of.The reason I took two stars away though was because of the packaging. I receive the product without any sort of attempt at sealing the top and about a third of the product was wasted in the box.

I have been using this Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel for years, won't try another! I have curly hair and it is an amazing product! It holds the curl structure with definition but without a hard or crunchy feel or look. It ""locks on"" to the hair when wet, but dissipates as it dries, helping the curl well defined. If you do happen to apply too much and it does feel hard or crunchy, it is easily corrected just by touching, pinching, our pulling the curl down.  If you want less hold, they have a regular gel as well.

Be careful! The product I received was not Deva Curl. I have been using Deva Curl for years and just love it. I bought it on Amazon because it was cheaper. I had to throw my whole bottle away because my hair went frizzy as soon as it dried. Be very cautious when buying this product on Amazon!

I have curly, fine, thick hair and I'm always looking for the right styling product. I usually use Aveda but they're on the expensive side so I wanted to try something new. This product has a nice light floral citrus scent, not overbearing at all. It's a little gunky going on, but after my hair dries there aren't any really stiff parts and the curl is good. It seems to last most of the day, too.

My bottle had a piece of tape holding the lid on the bottle. It was unscrewed a tiny bit and some hair gel had oozed out a tiny bit. The lid and the area surrounding the lid is now sticky. In the past I have received my bottle of gel and it was shrink wrapped and never had this situation.

Great tool, if you know how to work it.I have read a lot of negative reviews about this product and I get what they are saying but I am also wondering if they know what they are doing.Watch the videos on YouTube! This product performs perfectly as it is suppose to when used as directed. Apply liberally (use a lot!) to dripping wet hair and scrunch it through while your head is upside down. Scrunch as much water out while you are distributing it throughout your hair. Use a deva towel or soft tee shirt to scrunch more water out and then let it be. Air drying seems to provide the best 'cast' on my hair without any frizzies. Once it's crisp, scrunch the cast out. Shake you head upside down, side to side to loosen it all up. That's it. No stiff hair!My hair only needs a little refreshing mist the following day to look new. I only wash twice a week but rinse with the one conditioner every two to three days.  On those condition days I repeat the above process w/the gel.My curls range from s'wavy to Botticelli to corkscrew.

Hair started to fall out
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel has been a lifesaver!!  My daughter has the most frizzy hair I have ever seen!  I have spent the last 6.5 years trying EVERYTHING!  Frizzease, Fruictise anti frizz serum and dozens more!  Nothing has come close to the result of this gel!  The price seems high, but when the bottle comes you quickly realize just how much gel you are getting for the price (32 oz). Now, for the results: after washing my daughters hair, I put 2 pumps of this gel into my hand and gently massage it into her damp hair. Once dry, her hair is frizz-less (happy dance!) and looks fantastically SOFT (not crunchy and stiff like other gels). I HIGHLY recommend this gel to anyone who has long been searching for the best anit-frizz gel or anyone who recently started looking.  Look no further, this is for you! I will be purchasing this again and again and again in the future (but not for a while…this bottle LASTS!!!)!

I love this product, especially on very humid days.  It keeps my curls from getting frizzy and doesn't leave them feeling crunchy.
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I think it depends on the humidity how well this does in your hair. I come from a really dry place, so it just makes it more crunchy. Even when I fluff it out, during the day I will find stiff curls. When I have gone to more humid places, it works much better and isn't so stiff.

I originally used the light gel and wasn't a big fan.  I could never get the ""cast"" that keeps my coarse thick wavy/curly hair in shape all day.  This product did all the things that I wanted it to do.  For me, it works best by using a lot of product on sopping wet hair.  I diffuse and then scrunch out the cast one my hair is fully dry.  I'm finally weaning myself off of my hairspray addiction with the hold this product gives.
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Devacurl products are one of my favorites. I have naturally curly hair and finding products to help me control my hair is very difficult. I like this gel because it is never stiff or sticky and still allows my hair to move! It does define, but it seems to do so without the look of tightly wound curls or ones that look overly coifed. So, what I end up with is soft curls that are manageable! HIghly recommend.

I normally have wavy to straight-ish hair. Very little goes a long way. I dab pea sized amounts onto my fingertips and run through my damp hair after getting out of the shower in the morning. Then scrunch and let air dry. My hair is soft, wavy and frizz free by the time I get to work.

"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Arrived promptly as promised. No problems in shipping.  Couldn't wait to try this out.  Where have you been all of my life? This gel will be a new staple for my thick curly hair. It is very light and as others have said in their reviews. It is not sticky at all. Leaves me with soft curls when applied to wet hair. I don't need a lot of this gel for the soft curls, but if I wanted hard curls then I'd have to slather this on. Since there are other far cheaper products that will do that, I don't recommend it for that purpose. Use if you want natural looking, soft, bouncy curls. The product does not fix my dryness and I still need to use an oil, but its great for a wash and go. Enjoy!

Good product, but doesn’t hold all day and I have to use heat to set it, which I hate. When I let it air dry it doesn’t hold hardly at all, but it does OK when I use the hair dryer.

This gel smells like skittles! It has a thick consistency that dissolves into wet hair and leaves a nice, touchable hold. It doesn't leave the hair feeling heavy or weighed down. However, if you have a curl pattern that is very weak or prone to frizzing, this gel might not be thick/dense enough to clump and define your curls. It also doesn't do much for shrinkage. I prefer this gel for days when I want really big, voluminous first day hair or for smoothing and redefining second day hair.

This gel is really great. It holds well with no crunch and doesn't dry out your hair! I follow the curly girl method from Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey and my hair is the best is ever been I get comments on it almost every day. I have ash blonde hair which I think is considered 3a. This isn't the only thing I use to style my hair but definitely does is job for the gel step. I only wish they made a less scented version as it smells very  fruity and flowery but if that doesn't bother you then you will like this.**This is now several months later and I have come full circle. The only thing that bothers me about the gel is the strong scent which, though this probably won't be an issue for most people, I am just used to using unscented products. In any case, after I ran out the last time I tried several unscented gels and ""lived"" with them for a while, then I tried the Deva Curl coconut Supercream but all that did was ""grease up"" my hair a bit (though not actually greasy, is like ""lotion"" in my hair which made it not dry all day and gave a bit of a wet effect). I also had used coconut oil in my hair (not the kind you eat but a kind that is for your hair and has a very sticky consistency) and for the first day it looks beautiful, my curls are super defined and no frizz, but then the second day I don't know what to do with it as either have to put more coconut oil in, or cleanse my hair every day. So I finally re-bought the deva curl gel yesterday and used it today and I have SO many complements. I conditioned my hair with the Deva Curl One Condition and rinsed out about half of it. Then, in the shower, I scrunched in the gel and kept scrunching till I got as much water out as I could. Then I scrunched out the rest of the water (that I could) with a t-shirt and let it air dry after that. It is such a perfect balance. The hold is great but doesn't weigh down your hair AT ALL. My curls are fluffy and soft, not crunchy at all but also virtually NO frizz. I think I am committed for life. Deva Curl, if you came out with lighter smelling one I would probably buy a lifetime supply, but for now I will have to put up with the smell as literally nothing else has worked. Buy this gel.

So Deva Curl products are amazing in my book. I use this on my type 3c hair. I have lots of spirals mixed with some waves, hair that frizzes easily, and it appears thick but is actually not. I use this exactly as instructed. Apply after shower using a head upside down, scrunching motion. Wrap in a microfiber towel. Allow to dry in the towel about 30 minutes and then air dry a little followed by a diffuser. While I'm diffusing I shake off the cast! The cruncy stiff feeling is gone and I'm left with soft spirals. I also use a small amount of non foaming mousse before wrapping in the towel. And after diffusing I'll use a light anti frizz cream. But this gel is the key for me!

This is a great product, even for white-girl hair. I have the type of hair that is frizzy if left on it's own and straightening it takes so much time in the morning. With this product and a sea salt spray I can now scrunch it and let it dry and go. I love it.

This isn't what I expected. It is definitely a gel but it doesn't do what I'd like for my 4 year old's very curl/frizzy hair. Maybe because she's 4.

I got a small sample of this gel from Sephora and I love it so I went ahead and bought the 32oz bottle here, big mistake it dries my hair out and it makes it really crunchy, I don't like it at all, I think Is not  the same formula compare to the one I got at Sephora I want a refund.

This gel works better than the crème for me. It has more control and prevents frizz better. My hair is softer and I feel like I am having less breakage. However, it is good at controlling frizz, not great and it still has some crunchiness to my hair.

Seriously if you have naturally curly hair and are frustrated with trying to find the right product for your hair, give this a whirl. It doesn't make your hair 'crunchy' but actually has made mine look healthier than with other gels. It smells good, too. I've recommend it to several curly haired friends.

This stuff is absolutely fantastic. It does make your hair a little crunchy though, so I use it as more of an over night thing and then put another product in my hair to combat the frizz that was produced over night. It really brings out your curls, love it! Very satisfied!

Hands down the best curling gel I have ever used.  After my hair dries, I break the cast and my hair feels wonderful while retaining the curl.  I typically use just a little hairspray after.  Cannot rave enough about how much I love this product.

need to get the whole line ladies!! i have been using it for about a year now (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam, Mister right, and soommmmee times  the set above! It is A MUST TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED! Lucky me my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free, you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
This product works great for curly hair especially if you use as directed - leave a little bit of Devacurl conditioner in your hair, your hair should be soaking wet, flip your head over, scrunch a few pumps of gel into the ends and roots of your hair, and gently dry with a soft t-shirt.

This is a great gel - leaves no residue, does not make my hair crunch, and really gives me nice tight curls.  I bought this thinking I wanted the extra hold, but I think I prefer a lighter hold for the curls I want (they used the lighter hold gel during my devacurl haircut...I now realize). However, great product, great company

DevaCurl is one of the very very few gels that don't weigh my hair down. Creams just don't work for me. It has an ultra strong hold without making my hair heavier. I have thick hair and a little goes a long way. It's pricey, but worth it!

This isn’t the real ultra defining gel. It’s leaving build up on my hair making it look dull and feel icky.
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I really wanted this to work, but it didn't for me.  I used this several times as instructed.  It did reduce frizziness, and my hair was a bit wavier, but my hair had no shine and was dry and somewhat stiff - even after breaking the 'cast.'.  I even tried it again using a leave-in conditioner first, then Devacurl, but it didn't help.  I can't use something that dries out my hair even more.  After 3 uses, i just threw it out.  Wasted money.
"

Good hold, but made my hair feel dried out and crunchy.  Fruity scent smelled like a truck stop bathroom air freshener.  Overall pretty disappointed.  Not the product for me!

Brings out the spiral curls without that awful crunchy, wet look.  Works even in humidity.  I have color-treated, thick, coarse hair and had previously used Aveda and Bb and Phyllo.

Arg. I so wish I could give this 5 stars because it:-creates amazing curls without even having to defuse my hair, and-makes it possible to wear my hair 2-3 days by just touching it up with a little bit more of this productUnfortunately:-like other reviewers said, it makes my hair very dry(hint: do NOT run fingers through hair after it is dry - you shouldn't with curly hair anyways, but there's an added frizz nightmare with this product)That being said, I think the dryness is still way less damaging than using a defuser every day, and this product makes defusing unnecessary.

This was recommended to me by a hairdresser friend.  I was reluctant to use it because of the price.  I have super thick porous hair that tends to soak up product so I end up using a lot.  Most of the time I get so-so results.But...I really love this product in combination with the Devacurl Styling Cream.  I have found that the Styling Cream and Ultra Defining gel work super together.My routine for my porous thick sometimes frizzy spiral curls is simple:* Wash with cheap shampoo and conditioner.* Use a cheap leave in conditioner on my hair to comb out the tangles* Then I apply Ulta Argan oil to the ends to keep them from drying out as I have Ombre highlights in my hair.* Devacurl Ultra gel and run it thru my hair* I use about 15 squirts of the styling cream and work it in to my hair* Scrutch it and let it air dry for about 15 minutes to let the curls ""set""If I use the products together I can survive the 100% Houston humidity with style.I highly recommend you buy this with the Devacurl Styling cream and use this together for great results.  Besides, you can always send them back with Amazon Prime if you don't like them.  (Shout out to Amazon Prime too!)

I'm lazy about styling my kinda naturally wavy hair and have scrunched and hair sprayed for many years when I'm too lazy to blow dry it straight, but frankly my hair just looked messy most of the time.  A friend who is a stylist always has beautifully defined SOFT curly hair, and I asked her so many times, ""Do you curl your hair?""  She just said ""no"" almost as many times but finally spilled her secret : Deva!  I bought it a couple of months ago and have never looked back.  I never blow dry my hair anymore and get CONSTANT enquiries and compliments about my curls when in public. Read the reviews about how to use it or look it up on You Tube to get the most bang for your buck, because if you're gonna towel dry your hair, you may as well just save your money  This is seriously life changing stuff!  Just find our how to use it correctly, and you'll thank your lucky stars that you found this product.  I've recommended it to so many people, I should be paid!  But really, I'm just happy to give people some hope!  I just used the no-poo and conditioner for the first time today & my results were even better, but if you can't afford it, just try the Gel.

This works well on s'wavy hair.  It separates, defines and holds the waves in place.  It's a bit crunchy and wet looking, but if you use it on dripping wet hair, then scrunch your hair once it's completely dry, it softens up.  I haven't found anything better.

Gel drys out my hair a lot.  You have to mix it with other products to keep it moisturized but when  you do the gel may become flaky , so it  defeats the point.  Stopped using it overall.

Good light gel that does not make my hair crunchy, but strong enough to hold my curl. Initially I was wary of the DevaCurl line and wondering if it is worth the hype. So far I have been very happy with the results and this gel is a large part of the reason why. Easy to use and it leaves me with all day curl/frizz free definition.

This is a great product that was recommended to me by my stylist. I scrunch it into my wet hair and either diffuse it with the hair dryer or wrap my hair in a t-shirt to dry (called plopping). It leaves my curls soft, not crunchy.

"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Devacurl has really improved the ingredients in this gel! It used to have several really harmful ingredients, but they have done away with all but the synthetic fragrance, so I'm much happier with it. In addition, the fragrance that is in there now is not nearly as strong as it used to be (it used to almost give me a headache every time I got it out). As far as how the gel works, it still works great, just like it did before. You have to use a LOT of this (a whole palmful) for each use or it won't have the good effects it's supposed to, so the bottle can be emptied pretty quickly, and that hasn't changed either, but as long as your hair is well-moisturized or you use a leave-in conditioner first, it makes nicely-formed curls that are soft once it dries and you scrunch all the curls out. If you don't use enough gel, you'll likely have frizz and stringy, poorly-formed curls. Also, if your hair isn't well-moisturized before application, it will likely make your hair feel product-y and stiff like straw.

I heard so much good things about this gel but when I put it on it gave me a lot of knots this is not for curly hair is more like for soft wavy curls I will never purchase it again I’ll stick to my hair glaze
"
"DevaCurl Ultra Defining Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
This is a good hair gel for curly hair types.  The label describes it as being an ""ultra hold"" gel, but for me it is more a light/moderate hold.  It is not sticky or heavy and does not make my hair ""crunchy"" or stiff or look like plastic.  It has a pleasant, mild fragrance which I find slightly fresh and slightly fruity...do I detect peaches?  Not sure, very subtle.  Does not compete with my perfumes.  The pump top of the 32 oz. size is very convenient and I plan to purchase this size with pump top from now on.  This is the best hair gel I have found.  Sometimes I wish it had a little more hold.  For instance, I never have to scrunch my ends once dry to soften the hold as one usually does with curly gelled hair.  And some of my top curlier locks can look a little frizzy sometimes.  But I have very long 3a/3b hair (below bra strap, long layers) and live in Florida where it is usually very hot and humid, so maybe I am expecting too much.  I would absolutely recommend this hair gel.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
All I can say is O. M.G . Devacurl B'leavin is God sent for fine hair. I have sooo much volume on 1st day hair!!! Never ever has that happened with any of my hair products. Now I have to say that it took me 2x to use this product to get a grasp on how to use it for my fine, 3b/c curly low porosity hair. Make sure to apply in 4 sections on detangled wet hair after using a really good moisturizing conditioner or leave in because this product doesnt add much moisture alone. Once I applied the B'leavin, I smoothed in a very little bit of Ecostyler Argan oil gel on top to each section for hold, let it air dry, and the results were AMAZING!! I have so much BODY,VOLUME, and SHINE. I'm just shocked and in disbelief. If you are someone with a similar hair texture or fine/thin hair and you want voluminous curls, this product will successfully achieve that once you figure out the perfect amount to use based on your hair's needs. For me a little went a long way but the directions does say to use generously. Trust me, this product is worth EVERY penny!!!

I’ve been hearing amazing things about DevaCurl for years, but the price has always been a limiting factor. So, I was excited to try B’Leave-In from Amazon after a stylist used it on my hair at my most recent cut. This product makes my curls extra soft and springy! Smells amazing too! I was a little worried that the product might not be as high quality coming from Amazon, but the package was aggressively protective (lots of the plastic bubble packing) and the product was clearly labeled as “New” with the seal intact. Very pleased with the performance, quality, and price!

Love this product. This is a repurchase. Took me awhile to figure out how to use on my hair. But other day on a whim put it between my leave-in conditioner and BounceCurl creme gel and was amazed at my results. Beautiful plump, expanded curls, which is a dream come true on my thinning hair. I was almost out so I ordered this in the pump (LOVE) AND went and bought the regular size locally because I didn't want to risk being without it!! Again, wasn't quite sure how this fit into my routine at first, (I need a true leave in condish), but now it has a permanent place in my routine.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have very fine hair that is also thin. I love Devacurl ArcAngel gel, so when I saw how many people like combining it with B'Leave-in, I decided to give it a try. My only regret is that I bought the smaller size. My hair is BIG. I finally have the big, luscious, shiny, bouncy curls of my dreams. B'Leave'in really works as promised- it plumps up my curls without any residue, stickiness or frizz. ArcAngel encourages curl and shine and prevents frizz. The two together are magical.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I was introduced to this product during my first Deva haircut. I started with the 8 oz, but knew I had to have the larger size because I use it every time I shampoo or co-wash my hair. I have fine, high/medium porosity 3c-4a curls (Afro-textured), and I love this product. It has a lot of protein, so I don't use it with other DevaCurl products that contain protein; otherwise, it's protein overload (frizz/dryness). If your hair is low porosity, I don't think this will work for you -- your strands are already thick, and you don't need the extra protein.I purchased from this particular seller (it now says Amazon, but it said ""fulfilled by Amazon"" when I purchased). This is a curl primer, so it's purpose is to add fullness and body to curls. I put this on after a leave-in, and before a curl cream and gel. It has the traditional DevaCurl scent, which I love. I will definitely repurchase if it's still available here, and the price doesn't increase substantially. Amazon has become really inconsistent over the past three years, so we'll see.Also, as some other reviewers have mentioned, this was poorly packed. TAPE THE TOP OF LIQUID PRODUCTS, AMAZON! I've ordered several liquid based products, and they have leaked -- leaky packages or broken glass. You get a lower price here, but the products are still expensive.

This gives me great definition without frizz, and it helps with volume. I put in wet hair between conditioner and gel. I could use this alone and get nice, soft, relaxed waves in my 2c, fine hair or pair with another product for bouncy, high def curls. I do wish the volume held over the course of a day without other products for when I feel like going with more subtle waves and want to skip gel or mousse. It smells better than other Deva products I've tried; it smells like grape-flavored candy. Of note: It does not condition and isn't a leave in conditioner, as the name might imply. You'll need to get moisture from another source.

You can get some of the excess water out with a microfiber towel but don’t completely towel dry as it works best if the hair is wet. When I’m out of the shower, I spritz some It’s a 10 with keratin in my palm along with a squirt of Paul Mitchell skinny serum, and then I apply this to my hair while scrunching the curls.

This product left my hair extremely dry. Based off the reviews on the deva curl website I thought this was going to be a great product. The smell of the product is not good. It is extremely slippery/slick which I thought would be good. However, this was not the case. I applied to freshly washed hair in sections of 4 and finger combed through my hair. By noon my hair had major shrinkage and was so dry I had to put it up in a pineapple because it looked horrid! Will be returning.

First off, my hair is curlier than ever, and my curls are better than ever. Round ringlets and much less frizz than before (though there is still some frizz). I will say, though, that maybe you shouldn't apply the product as 'generously' as you think— lest you want dandruff-like white flakes in your hair. That wasn't a good look. However, my curls definitely were! Use this product in combination with good shampoo and conditioner and you're on your way to great hair.

(Picture collage is top without any Devacurl products and bottom is with Deva curl.  Extra photo is side view of my hair without any devacurl.)  Although Devacurl B'leave in does clump my wavy/curls together well, has amazing ingredients and smells natural it just doesn't do it for my thin hair.  It makes my thin hair show up even thinner than usual, unfortunately.  It ends up a lot more frizzy than usual too, which I'm not that worried about....I'm just more worried about volume and having my hair look fuller than it is.  I tried downing the amount I use and only using it on my mid to ends, but then it just doesn't do enough to be a huge ""wow"" factor rather than using no Deva products at all.  Also tried diffusing following tutorials which again, thin hair.  Diffusing just made it more apparent.  I love how everyone's hair comes out in videos/ads and was hoping for that volume and curl definition but looks like this will not be my Holy Grail.  If you have thin hair, like me...this will not do well but only end up highlighting those areas of your scalp where you are balding.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
BEWARE! Tried for the first time yesterday. Followed directions and added to just-washed hair. Curls were soft, well-defined, and bouncy. I though the search was finally over for the perfect product. AND THEN I noticed tiny white dots clinging to every stand. Kind of forgot about it until sometime in the afternoon when I was preparing to go into a meeting - white flake residue all over my black sweater. Started with a lint roller, but didn't work. Moved to heavy duty shipping tape - that barely touched it. So I looked like I had the worst attack of dandruff in history. Both embarrassing and disappointing. SLept on it and the same this morning. Only way to get rid of it was to wash my hair again and go back to my old cocktail of products that are barely acceptable. Anyone have a remedy?
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have fine 3a curls and I really like this stuff, it makes my curls defined without weighing them down or looking crunchy or greasy. You do have to use it correctly though. Put it in after washing or wetting as the last step of your routine before air drying or defusing. Scrunch it in and let curls dry, then scrunch again to break up the slight crunchiness for soft, defined, voluminous curls. Not sure if I like this or the Ouidad volumizing foam mousse better but as a product junky I can say this is a good one and worth adding to your curl routine especially for the price. I think the Ouidad gives more volume but this product gives much better definition so it depends on what you are looking for. Maybe together with my multicultural curl leave-in they will be the holy grail of hair products for me.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have about 2b hair and it's difficult for me to find anything that works right for my hair to create definition. Either I find a product that makes my waves too hard and crunchy (yet defined), or they are loose and soft (but quickly lose definition). This product is like perfectly in between. I feel like I have well-defined waves that don't turn into a rat's nest by the end of the day. My mom even noticed the difference and told me that my hair looked healthy.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I purchased this product thinking it would give more definition to my natural, kinky hair. It does not. I passed it on to my granddaughter who is of Black & Asian heritage, and it works beautifully for her.  So I'll have to give all stars as it does work for someone who is mixed race. She already had pretty hair, now her natural curls are defined and gorgeous!!! She said she applied it while her hair was wet, and she loves it.  I saw it for the first time on yesterday and  WOW!!  So, a Thank You from my Girl and a happy Grandmother!

I bought this after seeing all these YouTube videos about how great DevaCurl is. I wanted to try it for myself. I really wish I hadn’t. I used this product as instructed on soaking wet hair, after using no poo decadence and one condition. As my hair dried a white film developed on my hair. And I had to wash my hair again to get it out. So I walked around work all day explaining to my questioning coworkers why my hair was chalky looking.

I'm mostly 3B curly and this works great for me. The niche this fills for me is that I have one piece of hair that sometimes doesn't curl as much as the rest of my hair. This encourages it to form a curl. So, for me, it's not as much about being a gel product that reduces frizz or holds the curl shape. For me it encourages my curl pattern when it's being stubborn. This is especially helpful if I haven't washed it in a few days and I've slept on it a few times. Will definitely be keeping it for part of my routine and glad that I finally tried it.

Doesn't seem the same as the one I bought directly from DC
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Does exactly what it says it will. My curls have never looked or felt so good.

I had used the devacurl line before when I wasn’t too interested in getting my natural curls back - i just wanted some good products that could manage my heat damaged curls during my tropical vacation. I wasn’t too fond of the smell either. Now that I’m a “curly girl”, I absolutely love the smell of this product. And now that I’ve learned how I should apply products to my coarse, thin hair, I love the product even more. Application is not and should not be the same for everyone. It makes a huge difference on how the product will perform. And now that I know how to apply this product to my hair, I think it performs fantastically. I love this product now and it will become part of my regulars.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I LOVE this product.  I used the No Poo cleanser and the Conditioner with the green top (can't remember the name of the DevaCurl product), then put this on my wet hair. then after drying off, I used the Arc Angel.  My hair looks awesome!!  Its not crunchy!  I have 3A curls with baby fine, but almost thick hair.  This stuff is amazing!!!!!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
A bit pricy, but this is the best product I have found for my wavy curly hair. My hair is a bit long, so it can get droopy. This product really works to keep texture and volume. And it doesn’t feel like I’ve got product in my hair. It is still soft. I use a diffuser. My hairdresser (who works in a high end Aveda salon) commented on how soft and healthy my hair seems. I just finger comb it in the morning and I’m ready to go. And if I comb it out a few days later, it doesn’t get that weird frizzy look that I get from other products. Highly recommend.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product is a gel and did not work on my hair. It left a sticky residue and I had to wash my hair the next day the several times I've tried to use it. Do not recommend and now I read on new reviews (Feb 2020) that a lawsuit is pending. Since I purchased it in November, I cannot get a refund.  I went back to Sebastian Texturizer.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is a cheap fake.I'm sad I can't return mine, as I had set aside for once I finished up current leave in, n then was awfully surprised to find after application n drying... like WHITE COTTON FUZZ in my hair. I appeared S of I hadn't washed my hair in ages!!!!Just no🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫It's just BADDDD.It's bad. Stay away!!!!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Honestly the absolute BEST curl cream or gel I've ever used!!! It works so well and stops my hair from frizzing or getting big, that seems impossible considering I'm used to being a lady of mixed heritage with BIG hair.;-) Plus the best part, I can change my mind and straighten my hair (after I've used the curl cream in the morning) with zero residue!!! I'll definitely be back for more!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is the best curly product I've used! It makes my curls stick together so they look thicker and like a commercial. You don't need that much so the bottle lasts a long time (I think I went almost 4 months on 1 bottle.) The scent is minimal and it doesn't make my hair crunchy. If you have thinner hair and want the appearance of thicker curls, this is amazing!!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love Devacurl and I think this would be a great product for someone who has slightly thicker hair but needs a texture boost - NOT someone who has easily weighed down strands, aka, me. Maybe you could get away with it if you use way less than you even think your hair could handle. Mine however, couldn’t. So all in all, I know it works great and many people love it; but if you have thinner hair, use VERY sparingly or skip. An alternative to this product? Aveda Thickening or Volumizing Tonic!!!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It’s a bit expensive, but now that I’m using Devacurl shampoo, conditioner, and styling products my curls are prettier, more manageable, and they look good throughout the day.  My hair used to look like Hermione’s in the first Harry Potter movie, now I get compliments all the time. My hair became curly after having kids so I was new to the curl styling game and these products have made it so much easier.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This stuff is amazing! If I use any deva gel alone, I get frizz a few hours later. This completely solves that and makes the next few days of refreshing much easier. I like to use it pretty generously. I have loose curls but thick hair and this does a great job of taming it. I usually have good volume with it too.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Product does not produce the curls it promises. After the hair dries the curls disappear-- i think the product weighs the curl down. Plus it's a sticky mess to apply on wet hair only
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This stuff is amazing...very curl-enhancing, not heavy or sticky. Blends well into damp hair; I haven't tried it as a curl-restorer in dry hair. Mizani True Textures Curl Enhancing Lotion works equally well, but this DevaCurl product costs a lot less
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love this product. I use it when my hair is dripping wet before I put in my gel. I really notice the difference if I don’t use it. It controls the frizzies, adds shine and it works well with Deva light defining gel. It may work well with other routines too. I will continue to use it everyday and always get it from Amazon. It’s easy and comes quickly at a competitive price.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I bought this product based upon the comparisons to Aveda Be Curly and the many positive reviews, but am very disappointed.  This is a gel, not a true curl enhancer.  I have soft fine curls and they were only supported by DevaCurl Curl Plumper if I did not wish to touch, tousle, or mess with my hair.  If I touched the curls, my curls became  frizzy looking ( I have very shiny hair without this product.)  Aveda Be Curly gives support to the hair from the inside--never gel-like or unable to be touched.  I will not be buying this product again and am running to my Aveda store asap.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I was excited to use this brand of hair products so I purchased this cause I love leave in products . The product is real light and feels real thin . It’s easy to massage through hair but the bad part is that after it dries it leaves white flakes in my hair !!!? And it looks so nasty like I got dandruff or dried up gel in it smh . I did like that my curls looked beautiful and it felt like I didn’t even have any product in it but those white flakes I can’t get over it 😒☹️ So I will not be purchasing this ever again . 2 stars because of the flakes.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Wow. I'm not sure how but this defines each curl and there is zero crunch or greasy look. I haven't had frizz anymore either. Love love love this product.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
When I use products, I wouldn't say I like using gel or hard stuff on my hair because it leaves dry white flakes and it does not look good. When I placed this in my hair after using all the other products, it did not make my hair any better with the curls. So I will not recommend this to anyone.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have tried so many products for my curly hair, and nothing compares to this product. I usually straighten my hair because my curls are straight at the root, curly in the middle and wavy straight at the bottom. Now they are bouncy, my dry ends are even curled. I am in shock how nice it looks, even my daughter who is a hair stylist was like what did you different? My mom also asked me what I used and I only used one time so far.  Why didn’t I try sooner??? My hair looks 1000 times better.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is my favorite curly hair product! Coupled with the “praying hands” method, this product holds my curls and they last all day without any crunchiness or frizz!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Not sure what I think of this product.  I had a day recently where it made my curls look big, bouncy and amazing when I used B-leave in with some devacurl ultra defining gel.  The next time I used it I mixed the b-leave in with the gel and applied at the same time whereas I applied it first, then the gel over the top before.  Not sure why this would've made such a difference but it seemed to.  My curls looked a bit wet/greasy even after they dried and the curls seemed shrunken more than the last time using it.  So at this time I can't say whether I really would add this into my main routine.  So far what seems to work best for me is giovanni direct leave in conditioner (a tall quarter size dollup) and then putting devacurl ultra defining gel over that and styling by combing with a denman brush gently, holding the ends of the section of hair and shaking (the curl pattern will form itself).  I know that dew points also come into play and we had a lot of rainy days with high dew points recently.  But I will keep experimenting and update this review if it becomes amazing and I figure out exactly how to use it optimally.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is my holy-grail product. It is the only thing that gives my wavy/curly definition without making it feel bunky and horrible.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Let me first say a little goes a long ways. I’ve had absolutely no issues with any flaking. And my favorite way to use this product is on a refresh day. I get my hair damp, a dab of B-Leave-In and defuse. Hair has body and refreshed curls. Love it.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
DevaCurl products are generally a hit or miss for me. There are very few  products which can suits my curls and this one is one of the best. Not only does it defines my curls but also leaves it moisturizes. Even when I want to tie back my hair I use it as a gel for wet hair look, even after it dries my hair is in place. 1 star less is because this gel is leaving a white residue which is similar to dust or dandruff which is really off-putting.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Great product! I love it it does what it saids.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Thought this was a leave in conditioner turns out the entire line I'd produced is just a bunch of light hold gels I would not have paid this much for gel had I known that.  It doesn't even make my course wavy hair look good  but my mixed daughter with course curly hair it makes her hair look good
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product smelled very bad because it was past it's shelf life. The products don't have expiration dates, but because they are botanical based, after a while they start to smell bad.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Smells amazing and defines curls well! I would have continued to buy this product repeatedly - but recently shaved my head. All curly girls - this one's for you! Seriously the scent is like Skittles and candy! I lived being around myself LOL.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Product is awesome, it adds body to fine curly hair.  This price can not be beat!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Before you purchase this product look into the current class action lawsuit against Deva Curl regarding ALL of their products. Save yourself the  heartache, hair loss and damage. Take 5 min to look on YouTube to see what is happening to other users.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
The search for the right product continues. I used in combination with and without Deva Curl Low Poo shampoo and Deva Curl conditioner. I used it with other branded products. None of the combinations produced a curl that was soft or frizz free. Made my hair totally gross if I exercised. I'll go back to using Redken Real Control.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is a brand I love and adore, I haven't used it yet but it got here very quickly and I am in South Korea! Very pleased about that, I must say! The package was opened when I got it, but I'm sure that had something to do with customs and it still got to me in time and undamaged. It's always a bit expensive to get Deva curl, and shipping to Korea adds to that of course. You just can't find anything for curly hair here... At least I haven't yet.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Where had this product been all my life  it's made me like my hair. So many products on the market and sometimes they work and most times they don't.  This is an awesome product. I pair it with pattern shampoo.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Didn't see any difference using this. I tried using my hair care products layering in different orders, and nothing. Tried this alone, and nothing.Two stars for the scent. It smells amazing!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Please do not purchase Devacurl products!! Many people report losing hair and complete damage to their hair. I unfortunately purchased this prior to making the connection with my scalp issues and have suffered from intense scalp issues and hair loss. There is a class action lawsuit with this company.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I’m 6 months into the Deva curl method with 3c curls. I’m not a huge fan because I need more of a cast. B’Leave is probably better suited for thinner hair. I use it every so often for the shine, but it compromises my curl cast. It’s definitely not an after scrunch curl calmer. Use in the shower after your gel
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I use this in my Deva Curl cocktail that works well on my curly hair.  I have 3a and 3b curls.  I use this first and then the volumizing foam.  I then use a small amount of the wave maker and then the ultra gel.  My hair and curls come out great.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product has helped my hair feel soft and less frizzy.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product gives me bouncy curls without the crunch! It is overall a good product but with some use I find that I am not a fan of the lemony scent. Also worth noting that this product leaves my hair a little dry to the touch.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Okay, this isn't exactly a miracle, but it has a great scent and really helps turn my waves into curls.  I especially love how it leaves my hair feeling nice and soft as well.  Unfortunately, it doesn't completely take away the frizz (what does?!), but it's the closest thing I've found to being the all-in-one product I'm looking for.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
not only is it all natural, smells great and works!!😊...my curls have never been so curly, frizzless or stay for longer then a day! i usually dont write reviews, but this was a must to share!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product is so flippin’ amazing. I, for years and years, spent so much on Aveda Be Curly products. And honestly. This is so much better. I have very light but very curly hair. Frizz is a real problem. This makes my curls so much better and manageable.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Love the fact I got the product ASAP.  Don't like it was in a plastic bag with the top open to spill out, now that was crazy.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
First deva curl product Ive tried. I read some reviews how people were saying it left their hair dry but decided to try anyways. It did leave my hair dry and caused flakes from the gel. Didnt notice any difference in volume. Smells good tho
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It was beautiful the first day but it dries out my hair. I tried it with different product but it just didnt work out for me. The next day hair is just frizzy and dry.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This keeps my curl shape so well!! I use it alongside Arc Angel gel and I’m obsessed!! Love devacurl so much!! And I’ve read reviews saying this isn’t authentic, but mine definitely is.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
No flaking but definitely makes hair crunchy so if you aren’t into that find something else. I like the idea behind this line of products but this is not something I use often. I would recommend if you don’t mind or prefer the crunch
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have fine, frizzy curly hair and I use this with my hair soaking wet - works wonders. Usually finger curl the front. I've always used Treseme mousse or leave-in conditioner - wow does this product make a difference in reducing frizz and keeping my curl definition in shine.Highly recommend!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I recommend applying on wet hair
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My new go to product. works fabulously on my hair, it’s a little pricey, however I’m willing to pay in order to have found a product that works.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It's cool for a light hold with my wash n go. It has a light fresh scent. Does not mix well with a lot of other leave ins or moisturizers.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This works perfectly in my 3 year old daughters curly hair. Doesn’t weigh it down, make it greasy or stiff. I really like this product.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Hi, obviously did not like this product, for the money, there is no Miracle other than the name. Although hair products are not one size fits all, as all hair textures, etc are different, however; this did not do anything promised. Did not pump my hair, the curls did not stay, etc etc.  I purchased it because a friend highly recomended it. Her hair's texture's is like mine.Thank you.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Do not buy! the brand devacurl is under investigation for putting toxic ingredients in their products making people's hair fall out and causing migraines. Do not buy!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product, along with the other devacurl products I used caused major hair loss and loss of volume and definition. Devacurl needs to address this issue and Do some major recalls and explain what happened.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Best product for type 2b curls. Makes your hair so soft and bouncy. I apply this after washing and conditioning my hair. I apply a leave in conditioner, then this product. I apply it with praying hands on my hair.  Then follow with a curl cream and gel. My hair always looks perfect using this on wash day!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Smells wonderfully but leaves my hair dry. Really wished it worked for me like it seems to have worked for other reviewers.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My curls stay and look great without the heavy mouse / hairspray mask on my hair.  I can easily run my fingers through my hair.  I would highly recommend this product.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Its a really nice product but it did bring out my curls like promise.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love the Diva Curl products the b leave conditioner and moisturizer are just perfect for my natural hair style. I can adjust my curls from loose to tight by the amount I use.Also my hair is gray/silver and this product does NOT yellow or dull my natural color.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This truly works for my hair! It totally makes my curls pop more an they are more defined also! It's absolutely worth getting. It was a total Game Changer for my hair, I can't go without this now!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Tried it 3x. Each time, it weighed my hair down and made it look kinda greasy shortly after my hair dried. Blechh.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I decided to purchase this product because I’ve heard nothing but amazing things about the Devacurl brand. To be honest, this did absolutely nothing for my curls except dry them up and leave my hair feeling like hay. It was so frizzy and dull I just couldn’t believe so many people hype this brand up the way they do. I ended up throwing it away. I definitely would not recommend this product to any of my curly haired gals.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I had heard a lot about this product, but it leaves my hair really dry. I use it right after shower and then apply styling cream on top. I haven't tried it on dry hair yet. I've got better results just using styling cream on its own. If someone knows how to use this product, please let me know as it's expensive and I have the whole 16oz bottle still left as I was unable to return.
"

I love this product. I’ve order several of these on Amazon and love them.  I’ve also bought these from my salon. Same product.

My curls get a nice volume and frizz control with this product. Love how light is and how great it makes my curls look.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I only used a dot but it still weighs my hair down a lot. So much so that it actually pulled out a lot of my natural curl. Would not recommend if you have fine, thin hair
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Did nothing for my daughters hair! What a waste of $14!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It says no paragons, but this is a very waxy and heavy treatment.  I have fine hair and would not recommend this product for that hair type.I just threw the whole thing away, because it doesn't work for me.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Great for keeping moisture in wavy to curly hair. Even overnight when hair is not completely dry!
"

Love this curl leave in. It really does make my hair more of a curl with no stiffness at all. Feels good and natural.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Works as described. I love this product!  A little too expensive for my liking, but it works great!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I like the scent and that it seems to moisturize well, however it weighs my hair down and doesn't really hold the curl well at all.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love my hair washing products I got from this brand but the leave in seemed watered down or just not as good at all. Very disappointing.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Woke up with my curls perfect. If you have natural curly hair you know what a treat that is. Usually wake up looking like a lion

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I use this product every day and ordered a new bottle when I ran out. I results I receive from this new bottle of B'LEAVEIN are terrible and nothing like the results I've recieved in this past which makes me wonder if this is a true devacurl product. My hairs a mess....returning!!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Great for my waves and curls. Gives a nice shine. Not to heavy. Only use a small dime size amount.

I'm amazed at this product!!! My curls are instantly defined and hold all day without being crunchy. After using the product, my hair feels and looks natural.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Maybe I'm its because I'm used to my regular curl enhancer but it seemed to make my hair stiff and not as free flowing and bouncey as I expected. However, the price is less expensive. I will continue to try it...maybe with less or more wet hair. Thanks.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is a decent product but it takes forever for my hair to air dry when I use it and if you too much you will get crunch!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
but still good, i bought one at ulta and the ulta one was definitely better, but it is cheaper and it is still good.
"

My hair is in a stage that does not accept any product in it, but it has returned volume and I appreciate it, I should only find the perfect complements
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is my favorite hair product. My hair loves protein and it always looks really good when I use this product. The only thing I dislike is it didn't last very long, but I could have just been using too much.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I thought a leave-in conditioner would make my curls soft and healthy looking.  This left my hair feeling rather dry.  I'll be-leaving this product off my future purchase list.  Not impressed with any of the DevaCurl products.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product doesn’t do the job and my curls are dry and frizzy.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Wow!  Yes!  Use this with the gel.  Only put it in the middle of the hair.  Try not to get so much on your ends or roots.  This puffs them up, making them look fluffy.  Love devacurl!  Thanks Ayesha!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Expensive and my hair felt stiff.  I didn’t like it yikes! I don’t like the smell neither. I’ll stick to deva curl super cream styler. I have type 3 a -3 b Spanish girl curls. I also have sensitiv skin so it made me a bit itchy.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It works well. Smells like sunscreen from the dollar store. If you like that scent,  you'll enjoy this. Otherwise...hold your nose until your hair dries.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I like the scent ok. The product didn’t do good for my hair I gave it to someone that could use it. When I used it and after my hair dried It looks as if my hair was dirty

This stuff is so great at making the frizz stay away!!

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I like this product.  I use it in combination with diva curl cream.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Of all Deva gels, this is the best one for my hair. Light, you can't even tell you are wearing gel. No cast at all. Smells great too!Downside: no 32oz bottles...
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It is such a bad product!! I applied B'leave-in curl plumper to my wet hair, let it dry, I comb, I get all these white things on my hair which makes my hair more frizzy and tangled! I hate it! Seriously, I would advise not to buy this product! It is a pure waste of money.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
There's a big crack on the tube at the top, and all the gel is poured out! Besides The gel will spoil because of the hole in the tube!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It didn't work for my curls. Ended up returning it after one use.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Did give me volume, but also made hair tangly.  Sent it back.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Very sticky, hair went frizzy after all
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Excellent for defining and plumping curls.  I use it as a leave in and layer it with Knot Today and Argan oil.  It’s more of a styler. I seal everything in with the ultra defining gel by deva curl.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I cannot state how this products works because fornsime idd reason the bottle itself had a slash and the prouduct was everywhere in the little bag it cane in
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Used this product for over a year. What I didn’t know was that my hair shaft was not receiving much moisture. I am Afro Latina. Lots of curls and my hair is thick. My hair is defined as high porosity. Lot of moisture needed.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product has been a game changer for my hair. I have fine, spiral curls and now they are bouncy and defined. I still use a curl cream along side this. But this is a must add to hair care
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This stuff did a decent job taming my curls but gave me the worst white flakes I've ever seen. I'm at work today and I'm holed up in my office because I'm wearing a black jacket with white flakes all down my back. Embarrassing.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
A must have!  Since I switched to the DevaCurl products (and have purchased many of them), I have never NOT used B'Leave-in, because they tell me it is necessary.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Smells bad, no hold, disappointed
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
The curl boosting spray gel hold your curls longer even when you untwist your hair out. But you still need to use another hair product-a hair mist to keep it in place because that spray gel hold your hair real tight. The curl pumper is a great for natural, perm, and kinky hair what suits with your curling styles.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is a great product. It is my favorite hair product!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Not one of their best products
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love this product! It is a great base for other products. It's slippery feel gives your curls hydration without the crunchy feeling. It also does not flake! I love how it gives my curls a bounce without frizz. It looks really good when you diffuse and also if you air dry.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Perfect! My curls shine and are unbelievably soft and amazing!  I will always buy this one 👌🏽 Smell isn’t a “blow you away” type but it’s still refreshing!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product does give me nice bouncy curls, but it also leaves me with white flakes in my hair all over and I made sure to use it wet and or damp. I will not be purchasing this again, it’s embarrassing walking around with white flakes in my hair.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Even with minimal use (maybe a pea amount ) it made my hair SUPER crunchy as if I used moose.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It’s great, but devacurl is always so expensive. I love the product, I just wish it wasn’t so costly.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My product came with a sticky residue on the outside with long dark hairs stuck to it. It also didn’t had a seal or anything on the inside to assure me if wasn’t a returned product. Gross.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It doesn't work for me
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My curly hair is thinning at the crown. This product not only holds the curl, but it helps give my hair a thicker appearance.  Smells great.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is not for me
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Dont think its great for the price but it doesn't leave a residue of any kind, and does its job well.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
So I started using some DevaCurl products for the first time and they are wonderful.  It is true that most products weigh down your hair. This makes my hair curly and bouncy.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This didn't dry my hair out like most DC products I've used, but it didn't seem to do much of anything either. If I used too much of it my hair became pretty stringy.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Love it also it thing my hair is a little too kinky for the product but it provides great hold and gives waves when I wear my hair upswept
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Love my hair now
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Great for curls
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love this brand for my daughters curly hair. But this one was not a good choice. She hates the small, and it leaves a white residue on her hair.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is a personal problem for me. This product made my scalp itch and I didn’t receive the volume I was looking for.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I woukd recommend this and the gel together. Works great for my suoer curly hair
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Don't know why people are so obsessed with this stuff. Just seemed to weigh my curls down.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Love it when my hair is frizzy
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Smells like a perm and didn't c any results.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is a terrible product. It leaves a white film residue all over hair.

I love this product, it's the only product I 've tried that actually does what it claims for my naturally curly hair!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Product leaves your hair dry and brittle. Not a very nice product.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My review will be on the item itself being purchased through amazon vs devacurl website or local store such as ULTA. This is the exact same product for such a great price! Bring my curls to life!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Great for my hair
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Don’t like it. Makes my hair dry
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Good product to use if you want to accentuate your curls.  I did not find this product to be moisturizing.  If that is what you are after, I recommend using this with another product that focuses more on that.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Crazy about it! My curls loved it!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This DevaCurl gel has made sores and scales on my head.  Also it is making my hair fall out.  I would NOT recommend it to anyone.  I have stopped using this product!  Read the reviews on FB., not good.

"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Love everything about itSaw it on YouTube a few times and I’m never going back
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is terrible. It really is watered down and the product inside is not devacurl. This is not ok. It leaves my hair with white flakes, dry, and frizzy. I'm really disappointed. I went to Ulta to compare the products and they're not the same.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Destroyed my hair

"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is one of the best leave in curl boosters I’ve tried. It left my curls hydrated and easily styleable. DivaCurl is the best in the business for curly hair.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This curl maker smells really light and helps my hair get defined.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love DevaCurl products!! It definitely works and brings out my curls even more, that’s why it’s called “The Curl Plumper”!!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Don't think this is real does not smell right
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I liked the definition and taming it did on my curly and wavy hair, but even just using a tiny bit of the product there is a lot of residual build up that flakes out.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
For me this is just ok. Nothing special. I hate the smell too.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Best volumizer ever!! This stuff is magical.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love everything devacurl! My hair has always been so unmanageable. But since discovering Deva cuts and devacul products, I dont have that problem. Just gorgeous ringlets curl. This particular product is a great finish to my shower hair routine.

"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Usually DivaCurl products are great, but this smelt odd (like a ton of chemicals) and weighed down my curls. I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't actually the real deal.
"

Worked well but not last long

"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is a scam! I don’t think it’s the real DevaCurl product. This made my scalp dry & itchy, it left flakes all over my hair, and I’ve noticed some thinning since using this. I wouldn’t waste my money on this.
"

Doesn't seem to add or help my natural curl. Could be that the No-Poo Cleanser Shampoo and Conditioner just make my hair too soft???

I really like this product only issue is I have curly hair (3a type) and if you use it more than twice after your wash day, residue will buildup and flakes will appear on the hair and scalp. It does say leave in so be warned but it makes my curly defined and moistured. I recommend using a styling cream or mousse alongside for more definition and volume.

I used DevaCurl coconut styling cream, then DC light styling gel, then my trusty FrizzEase serum, and finished with DC B-Leave in Conditioner. A lot of products, I know. I prob don’t need them all, but was just playing with making the right “cocktail” of products that work for me. Then I “plopped” my hair in a tee shirt for 30 min. The results were very pretty, defined curls! I like the B-Leave in conditioner very much. However, I discovered that if you are trying to revive your curls a second day, wetting your hair and using this in the ends will give you crispy curls.  You can always crunch them when they are dry, but they feel a little gunky. I prob used too much!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have long, baby fine, curly hair. This product actually takes the curl right out of my hair. too greasy and slick feeling for me. Hair looked limp and flat. Provides zero volume, at least for me. Hope others have a better experience.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Honestly I wanted to live deva curl but it honestly does not do much for my hair I have 3c/4a and I find the stuff to not work so well on courser hair I see pictures of girls here with wavy hair textures and their hair looks great but it’s just another product to me marketed for “wavy” hair not so much curly hair and the price is just way to high for the amount of product that your getting
"

Product does exactly as advertised and is perfect for curly hair.  Haven't found one any better!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love this product for my hair. It gives my hair a lot of life and bounce. It's very lightweight on my hair and allows my hair to stay soft. I have recommended this to 4 people already who also bought it and love it!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Wow! I normally don’t use hair products, but this one makes a HUGE difference in my hair. My curls hold for 3ish days now and they are so defined. Just make sure to apply to soaking wet hair and either diffuse or air dry. I don’t own a hair dryer, so I just air dry! I would recommend this to curly headed people everywhere.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I was very optimistic when I first purchased this product because many people just love this brand.  Unfortunately, this did not work for my hair at all.  It leaves it looking dry and frizzy.  I tried a much cheaper alternative brand, Cantu, and it was a completely different experience.  Love the Cantu products.  I don't think Deva products are bad, but be aware that they will not work for all hair types.  Before you buy it, if you can sample it somehow, it might save you a lot of money.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I recently switched to DevaCurl Leave-In and guuuuuuuuuurl let me tell you! My hair just feels more moisturized, softer overall, and amazingly healthier. This leave in is thinner in consistency and goes on a little ""soapy looking"", which worried me at first, but the end result is amazing. This thing is amazing!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Works well for 3b hair. A little too thick for 2C.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I am not big on styling products - most of them dry out your hair and weigh it down or make it feel crunchy. Not to mention, most of them require time and effort to use correctly. This product is like nothing else. Fast and easy to use and even moisturizes your hair!While your hair is still sopping wet, apply a big handful throughout your hair and scrunch. Then gently scrunch with a microfiber towel... Annnnnd, you're done. Do not comb. Do not blowdry. Do not wrap in a turban. Just let your air dry and it defines your waves or curls and eliminates the vast majority of frizz.I know a lot of girls use a bunch more products and diffuse and the like - but I find all that completely unnecessary. I dig the wild, untamed look - just not the frizz and tangles that usually went with it. Poof, this made them both go away. And it defined my waves in a way I didn't even think was possible. Some of my 2B locks started to form straight up ringlets.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I know that some people don't like the smell of this product.  It does have a scent, but I do not find it offensive.  Even so, the scent goes away or becomes unnoticeable after a few hours.  I like that it leaves the hair soft, NOT crunchy, almost as if you have nothing on your hair at all.  My curl type is frizzy but loose, S-shaped waves, which Deva calls 'swavy'.  I combine this product with a bit of the Deva curling lotion, applied to wet but not soaking hair.  For second or third day, you can just rake through a bit of water with hands, to refresh the curl.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I bought this to add moisture, complete waste of money.  Applied it to soaking wet hair followed up with Arc Angel gel. I have thick, low porosity hair. It made my hair crunchy and dry:^( I chatted with a devacurl rep. about the product. I learned this product is best for 3a-3c and for volume. Supercream with ultra gel is better for 4c hair.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have wavy curly shoulder length hair (2C,3A?). I mix this in with ArcAngel 4 pumps each and i definitely get some curl boost, but nothing like moptop's curl enhancer ! 3 stars because ive used better and also this product sometimes leaves residue when i go back for more on day 2 or 3 hair.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I've used this product (and many other DevaCurl products) and I love it. It arrived with the nozzle in the open position, though. So a good deal of the product had wasted inside the plastic packaging that it was in. I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon or the seller to advise of the problem. Maybe I missed it, but it wasnt an option in my ""Orders"" tab. Anyway, great product, bad packaging from the seller :-\
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I switched from DevaCurl's Defining gel to this and I'm happy that I did. I have fine hair that is very curly...but without the right product, it just looks crazy and frizzy. This product definitely helps to define the individual curls. I put it on my wet hair and then partially dry with blowdryer while holding my head upside down, and crunching the curls. It can dry a little crunchy but it softens up after I scrunch up the dry curls with my fingers. Love this product!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Yesterday I was gonna give this product 2 stars since my hair was shiny and had volume. But by the end of the day my shine was gone and this morning my hair was sooooo dry and crunchy. So this product only get one star for volume but volume is not cute when your hair is a big dry mess. The worst part about this product is that it leaves a horrible white residue. Looks like I walked outdoors in snow.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My new holy grail product. I am Caucasian and have 2B/2C hair. I struggle getting any volume out of it, because it is pretty fine. The result is usually a somewhat limp, curly mess. I used quite a generous amount of this, but this only (to test it out), and it worked so well that my husband commented on my hair two days in a row! As any married woman can attest, this says a lot! 😂 I just put about a quarter size in am doing let it air dry, and voila! I’m done. No more using 3 products. This seems to actually help my hair dry faster too, for some reason.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product exceeded my expectations! I read lots of reviews and figured I would give it a try but really expected it to be another product that would over promise and under deliver.  I have very frizzy  curly hair. I typically have to flat iron my hair to keep it under control. This product allowed me enjoy my natural hair and feel good about my appearance. My husband even told me my curls made me look younger :)  Highly recommend! Will  order other products in this line. My only minor complaint is the smell...not my favorite but it goes away quickly.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Love this on all of my kids' hair. I have 4 biracial children with a range of soft curls to thick course kinky curls. It works well on all of them. It has great slip. I use Deva Curl One Conditioner, and then rinse and apply this product, and the results are amazing!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Amazing Deva product. Works like gel to hold your hair in place but doesn't leave it crispy at all. Hair feels smooth like a cream styling product
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I really liked it a lot! I'm still trying to find the right combo for my curly hair. Just makes my hair feel sticky and dry on the 2nd day... maybe I'm using too much?
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My hair loves protein so this has been instrumental in defining my curls. I use it with the ultra defining gel, since it's not something that I can use just on its own. I only need a dime size amount for my hair, so I definitely see this lasting me a while. Make sure that you figure out how to use it with your hair type. It took me a week to figure the proper amount and application method to get it to work for me.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I tried DevaCurl because of the reviews.  Unfortunately it didn't work on my hair, it just made it a frizzy, crunchy mess.  I used the whole bottle, thinking my hair needed time to adjust, but it didn't get better.  I do not this is a good value for the price as I need to use more product due to the length and thickness of my hair.  Not worth it to give it another try.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I was confused between getting this B'leave or Wave Maker so I tried both. B'leave makes my curls really shiny and plump but doesn't define or encourage new waves. The wave maker doesn't make the hair so shiny but does define and bring out curls. I'll use the B'leave when I want looser, shinier hair and the wave maker when I want to be curlier.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I get my hair cut with a DevaCu Cut. Hair is cut dry in curl families, not pulled out in sections.  Then I use this and another Deva Curl product on washed, super wet hair and let dry. You scrunch the wet hair firmly. You can use a few clips near scalp to to add height while drying. When dry, remove and flip gingerly with a puck.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
After using the leave-in conditioner, I used the curl pumper and then wrapped my hair in a tee shirt for about 10 minutes. My curls were better defined and not frizzy. I use this product with 2 other deva-curl products for the ""full"" effect. I've gotten several compliments that my hair looks very nice (when I use these products).
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have medium-fine hair that curls if you sweet-talk it. Otherwise it’s a frizzy mess. This stuff makes my hair look and feel better than anything else that I’ve tried, including DevaCurl strong hold gel. My hair goes from straight in some parts and wavy in others to full body spiral curls, with the help of a diffuser of course.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Really love this stuff! I've started using the full DevaCurl lineup after learning about how regular shampoo/products aren't good for your hair. I use this after the shower and lightly towel dry but still damp. It helps keep and define my curls which throughout the day tend to go flat and frizzy. I also highly recommend getting the No-Poo and One Condition shampoo and conditioner.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I have wavy hair that is thin and doesn't have a true ""style"" to it. This product keeps the frizz to a minimum and adds volume and body. The best part, I don't need to add more product on the second day. Just mist a little water and go!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
When this product ran out I ordered from Ulta as I was not happy with the quality of my hair. Now using the one from Ulta my hair looks much better and it doesn't get fuzzy after the first day. My husband noticed a change after a week and suggests I buy from Ulta from now on. If you don't like how the product is working try ordering from a verified dealer before quitting B'Leave in all together.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
If you have 3c hair like me, this will change your life. Clear leave in so NO white cast or residue. Defines curls like crazy! No crunch or hardness. Just shine, Moisture, and definition! You’ll literally thank the heavens for bottling up a piece of itself and sending it down to us curlies! The 16 oz will be the greatest choice as I first bought the 6 or 8 oz squeeze bottle from Sephora and ran out in less than 2 weeks bc it was ADDICTIVE and didn’t cause product build up(also I’m heavy on the product) but I had to get a bigger size and if they have a BIGGER one I’ll be purchasing that as well.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is truly a miracle curl plumper. My hair is naturally curler, but I have mixed hair, which means some parts are straighter than others. This curls all my curls. It gives my coloured hair shine and moisture which is why I ordered it. Don't waste money buying tons of other products. This does the trick!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Must have for anyone with wavy, curly and super curly hair! It pairs well with mirror curls and light defining gel, after using the no poo shampoo and conditioner!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I bought this product because they sell it at my son’s hair salon, so thought it must be very good? This product is nice when you put it on, only when dried up it leaves a white residue on my boy ‘s hair.. it doesnt stay hydrated and looks dry with white flakes.. not satisfied for that price at all
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I fell in love with Deva Curl the first time I used it. I used this and the No-poo and One Conditioner. Within 1 month I had lost half my hair. I did some research and found out that this has become a common issued for Deva Curl. There is even a Facebook support group. I'll never use these products again.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I've only used this a few times, but so far so good. I have really frizzy curly hair and it needs a lot of moisturizing. I think I need to use it a few more times before I can be completely sure, but like I said so far so good. I will update after I've used it for a while. I'm a big fan of the devacurl products so my hopes are up.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I was a bit hesitant to buy online as I know Deva Curl doesn't authorize Amazon to sell this product.  However, it worked great and had my hair has not suffered any ill side effects.  Curls my hair nicely without weighing it down.  Must use a gel or something with it though. It is not mean to use alone.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My hair had lost some of the curl from my younger years and I wanted to try to revive it. I had tried a number of mousses and gels with mixed success. This stuff is amazing. I love my bouncy natural curls!

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Deva Curl is expensive for what you get!!! I mean expensive!!! This didn't do anything to enhance my curls at all and is still sitting in the cupboard after 2 uses!!! I bought the shampoo and condition as well and MEH....nothing special.  Don't waste your money JMO
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
DevaCurl products speak for themselves! I've never tried a DevaCurl product that didn't do its job. This one doesn't disappoint. I have 2 daughters with tight coily curly hair and I wouldn't be able to manage their hair without all my DevaCurl products, especially this B'leave In
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product doesn't do much on its own and does not have enough hold for my fine 3a curls. But, when I mix it with gel or a cream that has more hold then I get better results. I'll keep using it but not sure if I will reorder.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This is not DevaCurl B'leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper. It is a knock off. I have purchased this exact product for 5 years from Ulta and thought I would save a dime buying it from amazon... Big mistake. It dried my hair terribly. I knew after using it the first time. it even smells different.  Buyer Beware!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
My wife loves this product. She feels “more curlier then ever.” The smell is great and leaves her hair soft, springy, and touchable.

I wish I had tried Tigi Bed Head products for curly hair before buying this. My daughter has curly hair and I’m trying to learn how to style it without frizz and keeping her curls in tact. This brand didn’t work but Tigi products are changing the game for us.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
Not my favorite Deva Curls product. I typically can use one product and get away with defined curls and volume. This product weighed my curls down and did not give me the volume I wanted. I may try pairing it with a form styler or with a gel to get better results. Improbably will not purchase again.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This gel is intensely watery and is intended to be a curl activator. A major problem I have with DevaCurl products is their insistence on watering everything down... what am I paying for!? I tried this a few different times... it literally does nothing.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I use a lot of Deva curl products.  I mix this with the curl defining gel.  it does exactly what it promises.  My hairdresser actually asked me if my hair was getting curlier. This stuff is the best!
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This stuff really makes your curls come alive! I really HATE using so much product in my hair so at the recommendation of my stylist, I gave it a try and oh gee oh my, by golly it works! If you have stubborn curls, B'Leave-In can revitalize them.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"

This leaves a great crisp cast on the hair but flakes once touched. Not worth it for me. I also purchased another brand for $3 and it works better than theses far as the flaking goes. I think the hype is not true to the way the product works.

I got this product because I tried one of their curl hair masks and loved what it did for my curls. This product however, was not great at all. Didn’t do anything for my hair and left a strange texture to it.

I love this product.  I have curly hair that is prone to frizzing.  I use B’Leavin, followed by Ultra Defining gel and my hair loves both products.  I was pleased to get this larger bottle with a pump as it is easier to apply.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
This product dried my hair out more than it already was. I used it in conjunction with other Devacurl products and did not get good results.  The cream is the best product in the line.

DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I thought this was more of a leave in cream. It's gel. I don't like the hard crunchy look so it's not for me.

Makes beautiful curls. The only downfall is some white residual stuff it leaves in the hair after a while of having it on. I have to mask it with somw water and moving the hair around.

I honestly didn’t like this product. It doesn’t smell that great, it makes your hair sticky and doesn’t help with curls. Not worth buying.

"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
I love all the Deva curl products. This one adds extra body and curl to my hair. I use it with the light gel. Make sure your hair is very wet when you apply.

I had high hopes for this product and unfortunately it did not work for my hair. Also it had a funny smell almost like it is burnt.
"
DevaCurl B’Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper; 6oz,"
It's the best product so far.  Too bad  DevaCurl does not advertise - I learned about the product by accident.  Living in Florida, I always had frizz - with DevaCurl NO MORE FRIZZ.

--If you found this review helpful, please click ""helpful""--I love ALL Deva Curl products! The more products I get - the more I love the brand! They leave my curls hydrated, bouncy, and shiny! On non wash days, I just spray my hair a little and put a tiny amount of this in my hair to refresh and BAM! My hair looks fabulous...again!-UPDATE:-This product makes my curls so bouncy and full of volume. The top generally falls flat but I use this and clip it up (see YouTube tutorial by Deva Curl) and BAM! So much volume!Curly and wavy girls, you need this! This will transform your hair!Thanks to @HiF3licia, I now realize that my curls need lots and lots and lots of moisture, love, and attention. Deva Curl products are all silicone, paraben, and sulfate free; all of those chemicals are awful for curly hair. Since purchasing this item in February (it's not July), my hair has started to transform from frizzy waves to more defined spirals. It's not all the way where I want it YET, but I am sure that with the curly girl method, it will be soon! The pictures attached are in chronological order. With consistent use of DC products, I am starting to see my curls become so beautiful!I do recommend learning how to ""wet plop"" because I find that it helps my hair so much PLUS it gets it out of the way when I'm getting ready. Also, deep condition whenever you shower with shampoo. It sounds like a lot but I just deep condition as I'm washing my body and shaving. The bowl method works wonders, too. I get made fun of by my boyfriend but he loves the results. The bowl method coats each strand of hair equally with product. I found out that most times if a curl is going haywire, it means it didn't get properly coated with product. The bowl method eliminates that and I do notice a big difference.Oh, and a silk pillowcase is your friend, girls!

I have 3A/3B curls and have been styling my hair relatively the same way since the 7th grade (I'm now 29!  #curlyhairproblems).  I've tried just about every drugstore product and a handful of salon products to help manage my curls and have been using DevaCurl for the past 4 months.  I think I've found the perfect combination for my hair and it involves this product.  By itself, I do not like the cream on my hair-- it feels like my hair is too poofy and needs something stronger to set it.  When I mixed this product with equal parts Ultra Defining Gel (which makes my hair too stiff), a miracle happened!  Both products together work well in keeping my curls defined, yet bouncy.  I've tried this combination twice and it's worked great each time, so I'm sold (because, before now, I've NEVER been able to reproduce good hair days two washes in a row...just doesn't happen!).  Also, I was able to wear my hair down for multiple days between washings.  In the attached photos, I just got in from a wind storm, which shows that the cream/gel combo can allow your hair to take a beating).  Crossing my fingers I didn't jinx my hair luck by writing this review.  As far as the smell goes, it smells like Skittles and is a little too strong for my preference.  Still ok, though!

I've been using DevaCurl products for years. I've always used the exact same drying process, styling routine, and care. I've used a mixture of different brands that worked extremely well with devacurl. My routine was borderline flawless at this point. I saw that amazon had the styling cream cheaper so I bought it. I've been using it for a month and it did not give me the same results. My hair dried out completely from using this product. My curls are stringy and lifeless. I thought since the weather is getting colder I'd need more moisture, so I switched back to just pure devacurl products to see if it would improve. nothing. same end result, stringy, dry curls.I'm not sure if I just got a bad one, but honestly I can't even use it anymore.

I heard that the gel is the magic and the curling cream that is meant to be paired with it is pointless without the gel. I have type 3b hair and honestly it isn't as great as it is glorified to be. What I do like is the soft to touch, no hardness the gel leaves me with when my hair dries and i lovee the fullness it gives me when it drys (pillow soft for sure!) --but I do not like that it does not hold enough for 2nd day hair.I have to rewet my hair again and apply product to get my hair to look nice the 2nd day. It is too expensive to apply everyday. You will also have to apply a lot of oils since it does leave your hair looking dull and not shiny. Although it is soft... what can I say, we are all still searching for THE perfect product...

I had used this off and on for a few years as a backup to the Deva Curl Ultra-Defining Gel, but never really liked it because I wasn't crazy about the smell.  I used the Ultra-Defining Gel most regularly, even though I never felt like I could work it through my hair enough and it left my hair feeling really crunchy.  I then switched to Ouidad Tress Effects Styling Gel, which had, for the most part, rave reviews.  It had a nice feel to it, but as much as I tried to use the ""rake and shake"" method for getting my curls to be defined and beautiful, it left me with straight chunks, weirdly-formed curls, and it was made even worse if I had to put a hat on over wet hair.As a last resort one day, with very wet hair, I put a half pump of the DevaCurl Styling Cream in my palm and worked it evenly through my hair.  I took a large and wide-toothed comb through my hair a couple of times, and then used a microfiber towel to soak up the excess water.  When my hair dried, I had perfectly-formed shiny and beautiful curls-  with very little effort and no ""method""!  It wasn't crunchy, it wasn't greasy-feeling, there were no weird straight chunks.  All over my head were beautiful curls.I still cannot stand the smell of this product.  Someone said it has a ""cloying smell"", and I have to agree.  Luckily, after my hair dries, the smell subsides.  And I have been using this product every day for over a month, and there has not been a day where I have not had beautiful curls on my head, even with wearing a winter hat _and_ a bike helmet! And again, with no crunch and very little effort.

This product is fantastic for managing curly hair without looking greasy or oily. I've been using it for 2 years, and it keeps my curls in great shape, non-frizzy, with natural movement and body. I use it both on wet hair after a shower, and a tiny bit on dry hair to retain shape after waking up. I have natural corkscrew curls with coarse, dense hair and had completely given up on wearing my hair curly. After getting pointed toward this product, I have been wearing my hair curly happily to terrific compliments from friends and co-workers. The product has a light, pleasant lemongrass scent. I have fairly short hair, and one container lasts me about 3 months so there's plenty of value for me in the price.

I have ethnic 4 something type of hair. And it is super hard trying to find products that will work and fulfill all of its promises listed on the bottle. I usually stir away from buying any products and use organic oils instead. However, I wanted something for my wash-and-go and for in-between styles. So when I went to the salon, the stylist told me this is what she personally uses (especially for the days she wants her hair curly). So I tried it.It is NOT like a gel it is truly a cream product. It dries with a light film (hard to described) that leaves your hair slightly hardened but not in a crunch way. It will NOT give you a lot of hold at all (which is a good thing for me). It's almost the feeling on a luxe soft paste if I'm making ANY SENSE LOL. It will certainly give you a bit more curl definition, however, it will NOT keep your curls that way once you tease/comb it out (which is typical for a cream product). It's the best option, I've found so far, to lock in and KEEP moisture in your hair after washing your hair or in between washes (using a spray bottle as this needs to be applied to semi-wet hair). It is not greasy or heavy, so this is good for all seasons.I know the price is steep ($24 at Sephora), but it's a good product.... even though we would all love for it to be cheaper right?! LOL. But you really get a quality product that matches that price point, unlike some other brands. You also do NOT have to use a lot. I have a lot of hair and I use about 2-5 pumps (which is not a full pump like other products, its comparable to like a skincare pump) depending on if I've washed my hair or not. I would use less in between wash days and the most when my hair is drenched. This product is to be used on wet hair, so use a spray bottle to moisten your hair then apply. This will also help you use less product of course. This is for retaining your natural curls and I have not used this on straightened hair. I really like this product and this is my first time buying from this brand, so I was impressed. I would recommend, hope this helps :)

I bought deva curl and after my first use, my hair looked atrocious— not at all what I was expecting. After doing some research, I’ve learned that devacurl products have been causing hair loss and scalp irritation for thousands of women. There’s even an on-going lawsuit against Devacurl for those exact reasons. If you go to the Think Dirty app and type in devacurl, you will see how poorly made and how bad their products are for your hair. Although I haven’t experienced this because I have only used it twice, there are plenty of videos on YouTube and groups on Facebook that have people attesting to this. All I can tell you is to do your research.

Was hoping for a light weight product to use instead of gel. It is light weight at first but the after effects are unfortunate as it causes your hair to be really greasy. I can get away with not washing my hair every day even when having product in it but can’t do that when I have this product in my hair as I have to wash it the next day just to get all of the grease out from this. Sadly this was a waste of money as after a couple tries I won’t be using what is left in my bottle.

LOVE. Can’t say enough good things about this product. If the Deva Curl Wave Maker isn’t enough and the Deva Curl Super Cream is too heavy for you THIS is your happy medium. I was in the same position and tried this and I get compliments daily on my curls after I started using this in my routine. I use other products but if you had to this does most of the job on its own for styling. Apply to your hair as soon as you shut the water off for your wash day on sopping wet hair for best results!

Love love love my DevaCurl styling cream!  I put a little on my wet hair and then pull it up into a sumo ponytail before I go to bed and wake up with the most beautiful curls. With one quick run of my fingers through my hair separating the curls and I’m ready for a full day of gorgeous, curly hair.  It doesn’t get frizzy, or look crunchy, it looks like a spent hours with the iron or spent the night trying to sleep with curlers in my hair.

I’ll never buy this product on Amazon again, because last time I got a fake product. Scent is different, hair looks different. Basically it’s like the cream doesn’t work any. Buying is from Walmart now, more expensive but the real thing. And still cheap than the hair salon prices.

Curly haired girls NEED this. Tamps down the frizz and revitalizes curls no matter when you use it. I refresh my look in the evening with a bit of this after dampening my hands and it works! Love the smell...not overpowering but clean smelling. I use this in conjunction with Delacurl ultra defining  gel.

I LOVE DevaCurl Styling Cream.  What I got was NOT DevaCurl.  I ordered mine from the company Gold Fulfillment.  I ordered 3 bottles.  The 1st one was the real product.  It performed just like the one I bought at a salon.  However, the other 2 contain something other than DevaCurl Styling Cream.  It dries my hair out and it's just a frizzy mess.  To test, I bought another one from the salon and used it after...definitely not my hair or imagination.  So be careful buying this.  For the price, I was SO EXCITED to buy off Amazon instead of the salon.  I am disappointed I will have to buy at the salon to be sure I'm getting the real deal.

I really wanted to love devacurl products. I had an issue with the styling cream. I didnt think much of it until i would get large tangles at the nape of my neck and i have NEVER had that issues with any of the other products i used. Also started noticing my curls were getting less defined, since i discontinued use they are starting to make a recovery. I know it was this product because since i have stopped using it everything else is the same except the styling cream and everything is getting better with my hair.

This, coupled with the B'Leave-In curl Boost and Volumizer, has changed my world. Seriously. I had no idea that a product could fix so much about my hair. Additionally, I've lost a lot less hair on the daily since I have switched entirely to Deva Curl products, and overall my hair looks and feels so much healthier. Absolutely fantastic product.

I love deva curl products but you should ALWAYS make sure you're buying from a legit source. There are expired or altogether fake products out there and it would be really unfortuante to spend money on old or fake hair products. This stuff is a godsend for curlies with fine hair and delicate curls though. It's my go-to!

I gave this a 4 star because, while it didn't work for me, a friend of mine liked it.  When i used this product I felt my eyes were irritated. It did not have the same affect on her.  I also felt it was a little to heavy for my hair.  If it had not irritated my eyes, I would have tried using less product an diluting with a little water.

I love the scent.  It certainly does smell like candy.  I would recommending using this with another product.  I don't know what.  I have used a little mouse.  I was trying to get away from the hard crunchy look.  But this really doesn't do much other than hold curl.  I was expecting something a little more than a lotion type hair product.

This product is so much better than the mousse I was using before. I like the pump bottle better than the spray from an ecologist standpoint. I like that my hair looks fuller and feels softer when I use it ! I wish that it did not contain alcohol and a group of chemicals like disodium edta and aminomethyl propanol , cetrimonium chloride. Why can’t “natural” products use natural preservatives and emulsifiers ?! Deva Shan , lead the way, please! You are the curly hair standard 😍

I use this with the DevaCurl ultra defining gel. I don’t know if it is them both together that makes it great or one or the other, but I love them. I got this and a satin pillow case and it has done wonders for my hair. I no longer have to wash it everyday to make it look decent. I say that because I don’t think I will ever love my thin hair! I took pictures of day one through three to show how well it held up.

I may be the only curly haired person that this didn't work for. This did not have enough control and my hair was very frizzy. It did make my hair soft though. Other users kept telling me I needed to use more but at that point it was getting greasy and at that price I would have used it to fast to make it cost effective. The gel worked better for me.

This hair product is awesome!  I have wavy dry hair that tends to frizz even if humidity is just talked about.  Just a tiny bit of this product rubbed into my damp or wet hair turns the frizz to fab!  After a couple of days use, I then rinse with warm water and apple vinegar (never shampoo!) and start the process all over.  Full head of beautiful , natural , waves and curls.  So many compliments too!  Love it, love it, love it!

I was so excited after reading all of the great reviews and thought this would be the answer to my thick, wavy, often frizzy hair.  After commenting on a strangers fantastic haircut while out shopping and her recommendation of Deva Curl I splurged and ordered the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream.  Sadly it is not the right product for me.  My hair looked dirty at the crown and did not smell fresh.  It's possible that I was not using the right quantities, but could not wait it out.  Returned

I do like this cream very much though I do mix it with a little of the ultra defining gel. By itself it does leave my hair soft and shiny but I get flyaways sooner. Adding a little gel to it makes my hair stay the way I like it longer. The gel by itself is to stiff so for me I get good results combining the two products.

This line of products was recommended by my salon (whose opinion I hold in high regard). Tried it. Loved it. It's a little pricey, but what I like is how soft and relatively defined my curls are. Of note: My hair is tight, coarse, kinky, nappy -- whatever you want to call it -- and this stuff helps to make it softer, moister, and more manageable. I use the No-Poo shampoo, the conditioner, mousse, and this styling cream for best results. Oh, it also doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy, it absorbs into the hair very well,

DevaCurl products have always worked well for my 3b/3c hair.  I use the original formula no poo and one conditioner, the styling cream and the light defining gel. They are staples in my hair care routine and I was seem to come back to them again and again. Pricey, yes.  Worth it if it works, yes.

Maybe it’s just me but I did not like this product. I used as directed on my naturally curly hair and it left my hair looking greasy, flat and unbrushed. My hair looks better using no product at all vs using this product. I tried using it multiple times.. sometimes with a defuser, sometimes letting it dry naturally... it’s a F in my book, hopefully it works better for you!

I have used other DevaCurl products but this is my go-to. My hair doesn't feel crunchy and retains the curl and it looks like the curl of my teenage years (i'm 50 now). Not crazy about the no-poo shampoo or conditioner - for my money Redken's Curvaceous Shampoo and conditioner are way better. Plus I have learned us girl haired girls should not be washing every day. I am now only washing 1x per week, but I condition every day. I used to use a lot of products but now it's just the Redken Conditioner and this DevaCurl cream.

"DevaCurl Styling Cream, Define and Control, Touchable Hold, 5.1 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
My favorite Deva Curl product by far. It acts like a leave-in conditioner. I apply three pumps of this to my hair while it's still soaking wet in the shower. I then apply a teaspoon or so of Arc Angel. I plop my hair in a microfiber towel until it's mostly dry, then finish drying with a diffuser attachment. I have wavy/curly hair and this keeps it looking soft and healthy.

helps fight frizz and encourages soft curls without the crunchiness that you get from gel. I wish it was a little cheaper, but it's the only thing I put in my hair now.  It's light and it doesn't smell.

I have been using this for several years and love it. It works as a moisturizer, as well as a styling cream. It does have a mild sweet smell, like Skittles, which is noticeable when wet, but dissipates when dry. On humid or rainy days, I need to use more of it to avoid frizz. The key is not to touch your hair until it is completely dry, and never use a blow dryer.

Honestly, no other product has worked effortlessly to define my curls. I tried this product because I had some frizz on the top of my curls and it literally defined them more.

I ordered this wanting the original formula style cream from devacurl, I received the Coconut super cream instead. I am not a fan of the coconut supercream at all. It smells strongly like artificial coconut (suntan lotion) and I don't find it to have as good hold as the original.

This hair cream has a light coconut/floral scent that I'm obsessed with. It's a clean and refreshing scent that stays in my hair all day! I love it! I have naturally wavy hair, but using this product tends to bring out the spiral curls! You only need a quarter-sized pump of this and you should spread it through your hair evenly to prevent any waxy feeling. I highly recommend this product for people wanting to create lush, bouncy, natural curls. Use with a diffuser for optimal results.

Overall great product. I have to keep reminding myself to use less than I think I need. Using too much will make my (3A curly) hair sticky and frizzy. The less I use, the better.

So far, I'm very pleased with this product. I have 3b curls that tend to get stringy and separate since I've straightened my hair most of the time for the past 13 years, but this product has held them together for the past 2 days (without a wash in between) and brought back some life to them. The only downside is that it leaves sort of a waxy feel to my hair, so my curls aren't silky by any means despite looking shiny. I guess that's what you forfeit, though, to keep your curls together and frizz-free.

I like this product as well.  It truly does define curls!  My only reservation is that sometimes it makes my hair ""too curly"" and you need to use sparingly.  It does bring the curl out and hold it.  I have been putting in on my hair once it is almost dry (after using a bit of gel and/or deva curl foam) and it provides the final touch.  Again, use very sparingly!

It makes my hair really soft, but it looks exactly the same. It didn't add any more definition or take out any of my frizz... I even tried the comb trick in the video and it just made my hair frizzer! Personally mousse has done the best for me.

Very disappointed in this product. It makes my hair very frizzy. I was using too much product at first and my hair felt greasy and frizzy. I used less and my hair didn't feel greasy anymore but was still ridiculously frizzy. Would not recommend to anyone. I wish I had bought the light gel instead.

My niece raves about this product and her hair looks great. She has big natural waves and curls with a tendency to frizz. I bought this for my daughter, who has very tight, dry, frizzy curls that need a lot of moisture. I found this product too heavy and sticky, difficult to work through her hair, but the biggest reason I didn't like it was the SMELL. It reminds me of a port-a-potty air freshener -- honestly. Really awful smell, but maybe it's just me. I know many people love this product, but it wasn't a good match for us!

I like the concept, it does do a great job with some scrunching but my hair is mostly wavy and by mid day it weighs it down. The smell is fresh.

Not what I expected.  Heavy cream and did like the smell.It does hold curls, but you have to ""break"" the cast for a softer look.I like other Deva products, such as the Low-Poo shampoo and the One Condition No-Poo Decadence and the Mister-Right.  They do a great job and they smell pleasant.

I have curly/wavy hair (just enough curl past wavy). It's long and can by very very frizzy. When I go get my hair cut, the stylists always want to try to use a diffuser on it, and my hair always ends up looking very clown-ish and they end up using a straightening iron. This cream is the best stuff I have ever used. I switched to no shampoo (only very occasional no-silicon shampoo close to the scalp and then all other times I use all no-silicon conditioners) which helps too. No-poo and low-poo methods are recommended by DevaCurl. But this cream is AWESOME. I just use a little pea-sized amount, rub it through my hair when wet, and let air dry and it looks great. Has a nice sort of fruity smell- not overpowering. You *can* use too much, but after my hair dries the frizz has decreased, and my hair looks very natural. It isn't crispy and the curls are soft. If you want more hold, you should try this brand's ultra defining gel. This one is for a more loose natural look with plenty of movement in the hair. Love this stuff.

First time using this product, I wasn't sure how long it'd last. I use it pretty much everyday and have at least half of it left and I ordered this July 31, 2015 (so, almost 8 months). A little bit goes a long way. I use this after using their no-poo and one condition products in the shower, spray on Set It Free, then scrunch this Styling Cream into my curls, focusing on the ends/not my scalp so that it doesn't weigh down my curls. I then use a little bit of their Light Defining Gel to scrunch everything into place. My hair isn't sticky or overly crunchy as long as I don't use too much of anything.I've used this product on my 2nd day hair to give it a bit of a boost and I honestly don't see much of a difference but it does make my hair smell GREAT! The less you touch your hair after styling while using this product, you'll find that it really helps control frizz!

When I initially converted to CG, I used only gel. I had curl, but my hair was so damaged that I wasn't getting the curls I remembered having when I was younger. I bought this product after reading the reviews, and I LOVE it. After scrunching out the excess water with a tee shirt, I apply a moderate amount of this then follow up with a generous amount of gel. Using too much of this will result in a slightly greasy look, so be careful. This product bundles my curls nicely and makes 'em shine, while the gel adds protein and sets my curls in place. (For gel, I either use the Angel or Aussie Instant Freeze, if I need a harder hold.) I highly recommend this product in conjunction with gel, especially if you are transitioning to natural.

Let me make it clear. THIS IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN. I was recommended this brand by my hairdresser who also has curly hair. I wanted the va-va-voom hair without the witch-frizz. This is it! Yes, it is a little pricier than drugstore but it is so worth it. I have long hair and I only use about two pumps for my whole head. In NY; during summer I scrunch and go (let it air dry) so it gives me voluminous yet a little beachy curls and during winter I scrunch and diffuse and its great. Also, it smells like heaven. I will buy more once I run out.

"DevaCurl Styling Cream, Define and Control, Touchable Hold, 5.1 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I've started using this along with the Deva mousse instead of using the Deva gel.  The gel was kind of making my hair heavy and dull.  This works better for me  - especially for 2nd and 3rd day hair.  I live in Colorado and have long, spiral curls and keep trying different Deva products. The styling cream is a keeper.  Don't have to use a ton, either.  Usually 3 pumps worked in right out of the shower; mousse about 20 minutes afterwards.

I really like this new curling cream from DevaCurl.  After years of blowdrying I finally decided to embrace my natural curl.  However, the road to finding the right products has been long and disappointing at times.  I use this after spraying in a leave in conditioner.  I use about the size of a quarter or a bit more and work it through my hair using a large tooth comb to be sure that all the hair is coated.  I then dry with the diffuser.  I like this cream better than gels because it doesn't give my hair that crunch.

I actually really like this cream underneath a gel for hold. The smell is great, and it's super lightweight. Not sure if I would buy again, but I'd probably come back to it if I wasn't finding anything else I liked better (since it's pretty pricey).
"
"DevaCurl Styling Cream, Define and Control, Touchable Hold, 5.1 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I had high hopes for this product based on other reviews and I really wanted to love it. However, I was highly disappointed.  I have very coarse, curly, and relatively thick hair. This cream left my hair with a very weird texture and seemed to make my hair bigger after a few hours which I certainly don't need. My hair also seemed to tangle more easily after I applied it and it did not control my frizz AT ALL. The other thing I did not like is the fragrance. I am not picky about scents, but this had a very strong smell that I didn't like. I have tried so many products for curly hair and this was one of the worst. For being pretty expensive, this product was a huge disappointment.

I have shoulder length corkscrew curls and this product works wonders for my hair! I used to use the anGEL but didn't like how ""crunchy"" it would leave my hair with the gel casts and I felt that it was drying my hair out too much (might have just been me being paranoid). I tried the Styling Cream on a whim and fell in love. It doesn't make my hair have the ""crunchy"" feel and keeps my frizz at bay for hours (I'm a nurse in the ICU and I don't have frizz after a twelve hour shift). I apply it the same why that I applied the anGEL with my head down, coating the underside and then flipping my hair over while doing a light coat over the sides and scrunching. I also use the spray gel on my roots just to keep it from looking too big and 80's style. Just a light quick few sprays it enough and doesn't have the ""crunchy"" feel either.

I have thick, wavy ""2b"" hair and use this product together with Deva's Set It Free.  The Styling Cream provides hold while the Set It Free adds shine.  Originally, I applied the two separately but now I pre-mix them together in the ratio that is perfect for my hair type.  I scrunch it on when my hair is wet and then literally don't touch my hair for the rest of the day (key for fighting frizz).  Although I still have the occasionally ""bad hair day,"" pretty consistently these products in combination produce soft, shiny waves.  It is sort of funny that between the Styling Cream and the Set It Free, you hair smells like a candy shop for a hot minute, but that quickly dissipates. Four stars instead of five, only because I wish one product did it all and because these products are expensive. That said, Amazon is offering this cream at well below drug store prices and I will repurchase here.

The Deva styling cream is the best leave in conditioner I've ever tried.  After gently towel drying my hair, I put a tiny dab (the first time, I used too much -- my hair felt heavy and sort of greasy so don't use too much) and run it through my hair.  That's all it takes -- great, non-frizzy curls that feel soft.  It's really a wonderful product!

If you have curly hair you know you need product to bring out the bestf of your curls.  DevaCurl Styling Cream is a must have for curly girls.  I have a Boteccili curl type of hair and this product brings out the boing in my curl.  I part my hair in 4 sections and use 1 pump for each section... I either dry with a diffuser or air dry... I get compliments every time!

I don't usually write reviews but this product left me no choice. It's worth every penny. I'm a guy with dry, frizzy, curly hair that I was afraid to grow out. I spent hours researching and well over $100 on ways to keep it hydrated, moisturized, and tame. I ended up with a 5-product regimen that left me scrambling for work in the morning, only to find my hair unruly and back with a vengeance by the noon lunch hour.Deva curl has ended all of that. With a single product, my hair stays styled, hydrated, and healthy throughout the day. DC humidity is no joke, but it has met its match here. My curls bounce, shine, and rock their bad selves all day long. Do your hair a favor and give it this godly nectar.

I love this styling cream so much. I use it in combination with DevaCurl One Condition as a leave in conditioner, and apply it to my hair while it's still soaking wet, then air dry. It leaves my hair so soft and smooth and tames frizz pretty well, but doesn't weigh it down or leave it hard like most gels or products do. Once my hair dries I scrunch it a bit and fluff it up to break it up and it's so soft and fluffy but still controlled. This is my second bottle and I will use this forever!

I really like that Deva now has a cream but I do not like that it only lasts for a short period of time compared to the cost. It didn't hold my hair as well as I would have liked but overall it's great if I use in generously. Unfortunately I ran out quickly within a few weeks, (my hair is mid back length) Too expensive.

I've been using this cream in conjunction with the Devacurl shampoo and conditioner (which I like) and have found this product to be VERY disappointing. I am Caucasian and have moderately tight, spiral curls. While this cream does hold the curl, it does absolutely nothing for the frizz. In fact, my $3 drug store mousse is infinitely better at keeping frizz at bay than this cream. I am extremely disappointed as the product does not do what it claims to.

Curly girls and boys, this styling cream works amazingly well! It's a small bottle, but it goes a long way. I have thick corkscrew and botticelli curls that have too much volume sometimes.My routine consists of smoothing 2-3 pumps of this over my hair immediately after I turn off the water in the shower. I also use DevaCare defining gel to help keep the frizz at bay and prevent fly-aways, but it's the styling cream that helps my curls from turning into a terrible 90s afro.

I have curly frizzy hair. It frizzie's if I do nothing but curls when I use a curling produce.  I have always gotten complements on the health of my hair by my hair dresser, after a little over a month of using this produce she was very worried about me because my hair went from being healthy and manageable  to extremely dry and notted at the ends. She thought that maybe I had life problems and was very stressed out, but the truth was that nothing was different in my life except that I was trying and new shampoo and conditioner and style produce.

I have been using Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Defining Creme for many years and LOVE IT, but they stopped making it in the liter bottle, so I thought I'd give something cheaper a try before I went out and bought the regular bottles in bulk. I have a friend with curly hair who loves DevaCurl products and I thought I'd give it a shot.  Bad idea.First of all, this product smells awful.  It reminds me of something a tween girl would spray all over herself before going to the movies.  And the product itself didn't define my curls or fight frizz at all.  Instead, it left my hair with this terrible aroma and styled in a droopy, waxy coif.  I have extremely tight, curly hair; perhaps this would be better for those ladies who have loose curls or waves.  If you have tight, corkscrew curls, however,  or if you prefer not to make people nauseated every time the breeze blows through your locks, I'd save my money.  Looks like I'll be sticking to my one true hair love, Bumble and Bumble.

My hairdresser suggested it because I get knots under the back of my hair since it's very curly.  I think it helps.  I also use a little when my hair gets frizzy but I don't want to wet it.  It soaks in after a while and tames it, not greasy.

I have thick curly blonde hair, and have written many a review on here for curly-girl products.  I think I've managed to finally tame the beast with Deva-Curl products, and a few amazing haircuts at the Deva-style dry cut salons.  1) never shampoo, 2) use your fingers to comb through with conditioner, never use a comb or brush, 3) flip hair over and apply styling cream to hold curl and maintain moisture, 4) coat curls in silicone-free gel, 5) remove excess moisture with a cotton t-shirt.  Voila! Perfect soft no-frizz curls

I wish they would sell this in a jar or bigger bottles! It's a good styling cream and it smells nice like lemons but the smell doesn't heavily linger in your hair if you're not big on scents. This product isn't very big on MOISTURIZING the hair as much as I would like so I suggest going in with a good leave-in conditioner. Also, do not use on dry hair, it works best on soaking wet hair, at least for me.I will say, it's not entirely worth the money in my opinion only because I know a cheaper styler that does a better job but it is a good product. I could see myself buying it again when my hair gets longer. I currently have a 3C/ 4A TWA.

For the past several years I had been straightening my curly hair even though I prefer the curls. That was because it was mostly unmanageable and frizzy, and would usually start looking strange and lose its bounce by the third week from the products I used.I decided to try the DevaCurl line, and started with the One Conditioner and the Angel gel. It looked alot better than before, but the gel was making my hair dry. I was advised to switch to the leave-in and the styling cream instead of the gel.I have been using it now for several months, and it's looking healthier and healthier.I wash my hair with the low poo, then add the conditioner. I wash some of the conditioner out but leave most of it. I use a paper towel to get rid of the dripping water, or use my hands, then I immediately add in a good chunk of leave-in conditioner. I use the styling cream after and blow dry it with a diffuser (much better curl definition than letting it air-dry). Looks great for at least two days. I sometimes use the mister to put some bounce back into it on the 2nd or 3rd day.I usually don't use gels or products that make my hair feel unnatural, and when I was told to use all these products I was worried it might weigh my curls down or feel gunky, but it doesn't at all. Hope this review helps.

This is a lightweight conditioning creme that helps fight the frizz.  I have boticelli curls that are shoulder length and it gives the conditioning without the weight of a leave in conditioner.  Hair dries fast and doesn't feel slimey.  You can also use it if straightening hair as well.

I usually don't write reviews but, the Deva Curl product line has me over the top in love. I have very curly, frizzy, out of control hair. I have it cut short now so if I don't have a lot of product on it, you could just call me Bozo the clown head. I've used many products throughout the years. Most recently would be the very expensive Loreal salon product line Kerastase. Their products are very expensive and I would have to combine several of them to achieve any kind of control. Just recently my stylist moved to a new salon. Usually, the stylists all have perfectly straight blown out hair or promote blow-outs, the straightening methods, etc. Well, in this salon, all the stylists (except for maybe 1 or 2) had curly hair of varying degree. I mentioned it to my stylist. She thought it was odd, too. Come to find out they all used Deva Curl. They all loved the way it enhanced their natural curl and REALLY, who wants to stand in front of a mirror and blow dry their hair?? We live in South Florida. I had a lesson one day on how to use the product. I use the Low POO shampoo and Low POO conditioner. I only wash once a week or even once every other week. I use the Melt in Moisture conditioner, as a deep conditioner first after I shampoo because curly hair needs moisture. Curly hair is different. Then I use the Low POO conditioner and I don't rinse it all the way out. Then while I'm in the shower and my hair is still dripping wet without wringing it out in any way, I pump 3-4 pumps of the Deva Curl Styling Cream into my hand. I flip my hair over (while soaking wet) and scrunch the product into the ends so that it makes a wet scrunching noise. I don't put it on the roots. This is what I was instructed to do by the stylist who went to Deva Curl seminar by the company. After the product is in your hair you are to wrap your hair with a super absorbent type towel that doesn't promote frizz. Actually, Deva Curl sells this type of towel. They also encourage you to put pins in your hair, not bobby pins, but sort of old fashioned type small metal clips to help set your hair if you have trouble spots. All I can say is that it has worked THE BEST for me. It's the least expensive product I've used in a very very long time. I wet my hair very morning and do the ritual previously explained. Don't get me wrong, nothing is problem free, but this stuff and the other products in this line are FANTASTIC!!

I first tried this in January 2016 and I have been using it ever since! My hair is soft, not crunchy and it smells GREAT! Whenever I hug someone they say, ""You  smell good!""  my hair is almost halfway down my back and I only use two pumps in my hair. Sometimes I will spray a little big sexy hair spray in it, but usually I do not use anything else with it. I won't ever buy anything else!

Okay so I decided to buy this product a week ago. I did not have many expectations because my hair is wavy (not the nice wavy)However I got it because of the amazing reviews by other girls with wavy hair and because I wanna be able to take a shower and just go out instead of spending hours in the bathroom either straightening it or curling it.So the first day it did nothing to my hair, other than leaving it a little stiff, just like all the other curling creams I have tried before.But I didn't give up. I decided to keep using it every morning after showering. Its been a week and my hair is curling!!!!!!!!After a week my hair appears to be healthier, shinier and curls are starting to form.! This thing is amazing! I'm so happy I got it.I don't have any other DevaCurl products, just this one because they are a bit pricey. But this is definitely worth it. I totally recommend it.

This cream works well on my curls if my hair is moisturized. If my hair is dryer than normal it still is a little fizzy even with this cream. I won't buy it again because the smell of it makes me ill. To me it smells like ancient old lady cheap perfume, Using the No-poo ""shampoo"" and conditioner makes the smell worse.

I bought this deva curl cream after seeing all the youtube reviews.  I have wavy frizzy hair. At first it feels good. But after the hair is completely dried up , it feels too scrunchy. Also the hold goes away in less than an hour. Expensive and doesn't do the job. I have switched recently to another brand .

This styling cream is amazing! I was excited when Deva Concepts released this product but was put off by the price relative to the amount of product you get. In the past I have had to be fairly heavy handed with curl creams to get good results so I was certain I would go through a 5 oz. bottle of this in a week. I finally got a chance to try the cream this week because I received a sample. I was (am) blown away. A little of this product goes a very long way. I was able to get two applications for my long, medium density, 3c hair with enough left over for one application for my mother who has medium length fine 4a hair. Here are the pros and cons of this cream:Pros:- Very concentrated; you only need a very small amount to get optimal results.- Leaves hair very soft but has good hold. The first two days I used this (first and second day hair) were very windy. My curls looked fantastic at the end of each day and i was out and about quite a bit.- Imparts a nice shine.- Very moisturizing but does not weigh down the hair. I had great volume on both my first and second day hair.Cons:- The price. While it is a better value if you think of it interms of cost per use (rather than cost per once) since you don't need to use very much, I still think it is slightly overpriced. It is about $7.00 more than their styling gels and while most people will need to use a bit more gel to get similar results as this cream I don't think it quite balances out.

I love DevaCurl. BUT this product is not for me. I bought it with high hopes and was disappointed. I have a lot of hair and is thick 3b/3c curls. The first time I  used it, it has left my hair weight down and stiff. It did not define my curl. So, I decided to give it a second try just in case I was the one seeing things. The second time I used it, same result. And my family and friends noticed! They told me me hair did not look as curly and that it looked stiff and weigh down. Bummer! And I have 2 bottles. What works wonderful for me after getting out of the shower is applying Ouidads ""Moisture Lock Leave in Conditioner"" then spraying Deva Curls ""Set it Free moisture lock"" spray. Results: Amazing Curls!

I did not buy this from Amazon but I want you to know how happy I am with the product. I have short very wavy/curly hair and it works great. Scrunch it in on wet hair and avoid the hair brush. I air dry most days but in a pinch I'll use the hair dryer with a diffuser. My hair is usually hit or miss after drying but 4 days in a row I am happy. I just use a dime size dab.

I ordered the trial set and I am hooked on this styling cream. I am African American with 3c/4a hair type- I basically have corkscrew curls. I use this styling cream along with the light defining gel and my curls are super defined and soft. My wash and go's are taken to the next level with these products. I have no frizz all day, I loosely pineapple my hair at night and when I get up, I literally shake and go. The curls are still super defined after a day. I am planning to purchase the more of the styling cream and gel very soon!!

After 30 years of fighting my curly hair with everything from up dos to relaxers as well as Brazilian and Japanese straitening at the salon, I finally enjoy having curls.My hair dresser first introduced me to this product.  She specializes in curly hair cuts and uses dry hair cuts for curls ( you can find a dry cut specialist in you area by googling ""natural curly website"" and using the ""find a local salon"" tab. For my, slightly past shoulder length, hair I was told to use 2 pumps . I then follow with Devacurl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam to give my curls some extra hold. Between those two products I would say the styling cream is the miracle I've been looking for.

I used a couple other products in the Deva Curl line years ago, before they reformulated... I remember liking No Poo and One Conditioner, but I bought, tried and returned every single other product from the line at Ulta.  I got my hair cut by a Devachan-trained stylist for the first time last week, and he used this cream on my hair, giving amazing results... even overnight!  So, I bought it.  I have had fabulous (3B) curls the past few years using Kinky Curly Curling Custard and a cheap gel (Herbal Essences Set Me Up), but it rarely looks good enough to leave the house as 2nd-day-hair.  With this Deva cream, I can actually go three days and look good... I can run my fingers through my hair and no frizz, just voluminous, clumpy curls... what?!  LOVE IT.

love this cream. works great for my  naturaly curly hair. The no poo and the conditioner on the other hand i did not like and actually made my hair frizzer and puffier (not what we curly heads want.) but I did love the styling cream. Make my hair soft and help give my curls great definition.

Tried a sample of this for 2 days (provided by another company). Scrunched it into my wet hair and let it air dry. I loved how it didn't make my hair crunchy like other products can, nor did my hair look like it was wet all day long. My waves were full and soft. HOWEVER, I couldn't handle the overpowering scent. It was so strong I felt I could taste it. I had to toss the remainder of the sample. I won't use it again.

This product is a must-have in my bathroom cabinet. I can't live without it. After showering and towel drying my hair, I put 1-2 pumps in my hands and scrunch it through my hair.

I love this product in addition to the One Condition. I recently got a deva cut and when my hair was styled it looked the best that it has ever been!!!! I went ahead and purchased the products for home use. I'm on second day hair and it still looks amazing but now it's starting to get more volume. My hair is well tamed and smells amazing too. My curls are perfectly defined and so soft. I have a mixture of 3c and 4a hair.

I've been fighting my coarse, curly hair for decades. Every once in awhile I'll find something I like, and then it's discontinued. More often though, it just stops working like I expect. Is it because companies reformulate? That is always possible. It's also possible that the hair I had in my teens, 20's, and 30's isn't the same from decade to decade and I have to live with that.Currently I have it color treated a dark color, and am growing it out. Kind of like the Mary Louise Parker look (only not with short shorts). I have a good hair day if I leave it curly, maybe once a month. It's so frustrating. I can't seem to find advice for my certain hair, from anyone who HAS this kind of hair. Even the Folica forums are filled with people much younger than myself, with time to mess with their hair endlessly. That's not me. I just need something to put on it and use minimum effort, to ENHANCE and CONTROL what I have.One day I was in an Ulta whose manager treats me like I have a communicable disease and shoplift; praying that the first person to offer help would not be her. At any rate, when I was once again looking for a curly-hair product, I went in that day with not so great hair. You would think this would be the perfect time for someone to see just what they need to work with and make a good recommendation! So here comes MisManager, looking all over at my purse, hands, etc. as she asks me if she can help me? I told her what I need, and she started pointing out products that weren't even appropriate. (She has very very thin, fine hair made bone white, black, and pink, and plastered to her skull....so she showed me products that would work for her). Finally we came to the Deva Curl section and she said, ""They have great shampoo!"" But I'm not looking for shampoo, I need a STYLING CREAM. She pulled out their gel, ""This is great gel!"" (BANG HEAD) Finally I found the styling cream. She chirped happily, ""Oh that's great cream!"" I told her it was hard to find stuff that worked, and she said: (brace for it) ""Well it can't look any worse than it does now!""Her customer service skills were so impressive, that I bought it on the spot. Actually I knew if I did not like it, I could return it (which I expected).There are a lot of nice things about the Deva Curl and you may not discover them until you play with it awhile. There are many ways to use it. Let me caution you about using it as a final touch up on dry or mostly dry hair: you may look like you didn't wash your hair recently. (Use VERY sparingly) Also, if you don't distribute it well enough, you get white dried lumps in your hair. If you work around anyone who has a juvenile mindset, expect to hear about the white things in your hair.I like to put in one squirt (my hair is past shoulder length) and use it as a blowdry cream until my hair is about 3/4 dry, and then squish in another squirt into the ends and shafts, scrunch it in, and let it air dry, for lots of curls. You can do some finger spirals and such to shape them how you want.I also like to put in two squirts and distribute that, and blowdry my hair until finished (with some Milk Shake serum also) with my hands (no brushes, just fingers). the Deva Curl makes the hair smooth and shiny, it's not STRAIGHT But there is just enough shine and definition and wave to look like you didn't even do your hair. (When we all know that if I didn't 'do' my hair I would look like Krusty the Clown)I'm on my second bottle of the Deva Curl, and the price on Amazon is way less than Ulta. So instead of $26 and Cruella DeVille, I can order this for less from the comfort of my home, sitting with my ""couldn't be worse"" hair :--) With use several times a week, I got about 3 months out of this bottle. Realistically, I probably get closer to 2 months now that I'm learning how to work with it more.UPDATE: I put this (one squirt) into my hair and used it as a setting lotion with big rollers...can you believe it works??? Very smooth results.

I got this as a sample and figured maybe it would help my fine, barely wavy hair get a little oomph. That's exactly what it did. It's helped my hair hang on to the little bit of wave that it has, made it hold up a little better through the day. So though I'm no curly-head, I'm a convert.

I have been processing my hair using Japanese straightening techniques for over ten years. However, since I got pregnant a year back I couldn't do any chemical treatment and was left to embrace my unruly curls again. I usually blow dry my hair straight. But since we had plans of going to Hawaii and knowing the humidity factor I was dreading my trip. After some research I came across devacurls and thought of give it a try. Please make note that I have never used any other curling products other than Devacurls. I ended up not going to Hawaii and instead visited India for a family emergency. It wasn't humid this time of the year but I didn't have the luxury to blow dry my hair and straighten every time I washed my hair.So here's my feedback :Pros:It doesn't feel too strong or stickySeems less damaging to my hair ( ha - I chemical treated my hair for ten years)Looks really good when it is first appliedCons:Tends to lose the hold after a couple of hours(Maybe because I have a ton of hair)I intend to combine the product with the gel like another reviewer suggestd

Provides a great level of control to my thick, curly hair. I've put this in while my hair is damp and it locks in plenty of moisture while not giving that greasy feeling you get from some stylers. I've also had success using this on my hair when it's dry so this is a very versatile product. My hair is a foot in length, maybe a bit longer, at the time of writing this review and I find about 2 pumps of this product is enough to give me the result I'm looking for.Another great thing about this product is the smell. It smells like Skittles! Love it, hah!

I use this product after every wash or rather every condition, with the One condition conditioner. Four pumps of the gel and 2 1/2 of this cream on medium length, average thickness hair. I let it dry about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way and then dry with a diffuser while scrunching the curls. turns out perfect every time. I also never comb or brush my hair but use my fingers to detangle with conditioner in the shower. I agree that the smell is not good! like skittles and who wants to smell like that? Mixed with the scents of the other products it seems to tone it down and when dry not so bad but I wish I could have perfect hair without the smell of skittles.

I have tested a variety of curly hair products, the good and the bad. After trying this one i would rate it somewhere in the middle. It defines curls and minimizes frizz, but i felt like it left my hair with a greasy texture that was hard to get out. It's also really easy for it to clump in one place in your hair if you're not careful because it has such a thick consistency. For the price, i'd rather get something else. If it was cheaper i would use this regularly though.

I have fine, grey, wavy hair and this product works amazingly well to give me beautiful spiral curls but I have to put it on while my hair is soaking wet.

A few years ago I had gotten a Deva curl cut and purchased products from a salon. I loved what products did for my hair. I've grown up with curly frizzy hair that's not very coarse but also not very manageable. This gel provides just enough hold for my curls to look great without making my hair super crunchy. The first time I used it I think I used too much but I was able to break apart the curls and they looked great. Having had time to play around with the ratio I've been able to achieve a look that seems effortless. I literally wash my hair with regular shampoo then flip and condition with my hair upside down and after conditioning I scrunch the gel into my hair while it's still soaking wet and upside down. This method seems to work best for me but I also have long hair. Where I live there is not much humidity but it gets extremely hot and even with sweating my hair hasn't frizzed back up and the gel integrity was not compromised. This is a great price for this product, in the salon I paid almost double for a smaller bottle. Will purchase again!

I buy all of them in the large bottles now. Individually they are good products but together they have changed my curls. I am not kidding at all!

I've been using this gel for years as my go-to hair product. With this most recent purchase, after using it, I noticed my hair looked as if...well, as if I hadn't even showered! I thought, maybe I forgot to apply it...? Next time I showered, I used it again...and it looked like I hadn't used any product at all. Complete frizz. I checked the ingredient list in comparison to my empty bottle and...sure enough, some of the ingredients have changed! This gel does not work any more for my hair.

Hair just finished drying, and I just finished the last step in the directions listed on the product bottle... I am still in disbelief.I spontaneously decided to DIY perm my naturally pin-straight Asian hair last week and since have been realizing i am so unprepared to manage curly hair. I bought some cult favorite products (Curl Smoothie, Pantene Curl Gel, etc) before landing on this gel by Devacurl, and none of the others defined and tamed my hair like this. I was convinced that i didn’t properly set some strands of my perm and that they were just going to be demaged and straight. After using this light gel and following the directions (apply evenly to soaking hair, scrunch with a microfiber towel, dry without touching (!!), then upward scrunch the crunchiness away for soft curls. Did all of the following and i can see every wave and Curl i set in my home perm, giving me back hope that i didn’t totally screw up my hair.TBH i used devacurl last bc i thought it would only work on natural curls and bc it’s a salon product and harder to get than drugstore products. I was totallllyyytt wrong and think this is better for artificial curls more than anything!Totally obsessed, i want to marry it.

I hated my curly hair, it would always just turn to fluff within a couple hours of styling. I mean fluffy to the point people would attempt to pet my head. After trying the deva curl product I’m learning to embrace my curls. They are defined and soft, full of movement. I get compliments all the time now, and I’m feeling better about wearing my natural curves. I previously used Shae Moisture, but my curls weren’t nearly as defined. Make sure you leave some of their conditioner in, squeeze the water out of your hair, blot with a microfiber towel then add enough gel that when your hair dries it’s crunchy. Once completely dry scrunch out the product. You are left with soft defined hair all day.Downside: takes forever to dry. Get a diffuser and set aside sometime.

Absoluletly nothing better for your curly hair than Deva Curl products. I use them all and my curls have never looked better! For years I hated my curly hair. It was frizzy, dried out and impossible to work with. I had tried everything out there than said it was for curly hair and I never got the results I wanted with any other product. Deva Curl has made me love and embrace my curls. I now get stopped on the street by people telling me how much they love my curls and how pretty my hair is. Even my hairdresser has become a believer and is using Deva Curl with all her curly haired clients.

Love this product.  I've used numerous curl products throughout my life (including Eufora and Bumble & Bumble) and this is my favorite as far as results.  It creates a defined curl without the ""crispiness"" that some products create.  My ONLY complaint about this line of products is with the smell.  Its not a fragrance that I like, or can even place.  Whereas the Bumble and Bumble is vaguely floral and soft smelling, this is more anise(?) smelling.

The product worked well for the most part.  The front/sides of my hair had a soft curl, the back however was frizzy.  Not crazy about the scent, but it went away after hair dried.  I have very thick hair that has curly, wavy & straight sections.  Drying it naturally took several hours, so this is not something I can use if I need to be somewhere early.  When my hair dried, it still looked somewhat wet and “crunchy”.  Fingering it out softened if it but also pulled some curl out & increased frizz.  I’ll defin use again... hoping it will get better with practice 🤗.  Price is great as I saw this in a salon and it was twice as expensive.

I used this in combinations with Deva curl No-poo cleanser and one conditioner. I love the shampoo and conditioner (doesn't dry out my hair) but I think adding this light gel helps define my curls. I leave my hair wrapped in a towel for around 10 minutes after showering and then use about a quarter size amount of gel, crunching my hair as I work it in. Once my hair is dry, there is no gel residue. I also put in a little bit of matrix biolage hydra-seal leave in cream (after my hair dries) because it helps smooth the little bit of frizz that's left. Before using Deva curl products my hair was questionably wavy. It would be straight in certain areas and wavy/kinky in others. Now I have soft waves throughout. Love, love, love this product line. As far as how long it will last- I shower every other day, have had this since January and still have 3/4 of a bottle left. Smells great too!

A few years ago I had gotten a Deva curl cut and purchased products from a salon. I loved what products did for my hair. I've grown up with curly frizzy hair that's not very coarse but also not very manageable. This gel provides just enough hold for my curls to look great without making my hair super crunchy. The first time I used it I think I used too much but I was able to break apart the curls and they looked great. Having had time to play around with the ratio I've been able to achieve a look that seems effortless. I literally wash my hair with regular shampoo then flip and condition with my hair upside down and after conditioning I scrunch the gel into my hair while it's still soaking wet and upside down. This method seems to work best for me but I also have long hair. Where I live there is not much humidity but it gets extremely hot and even with sweating my hair hasn't frizzed back up and the gel integrity was not compromised. This is a great price for this product, in the salon I paid almost double for a smaller bottle. Will purchase again!

I am a huge fan of DevaCurl products. I have been using DevaCurl for over a year now. It works well for both my long hair and short hair.I started with their travel size of the ""DevaCurl Kit for All Curl Kind"" It includes 3oz bottles of  No-Poo Original, One Condition Original, Styling Cream, Light Defining Gel.I was really shocked at how well this line of products worked on my hair. I buy all of them in the large bottles now. Individually they are good products but together they have changed my curls. I am not kidding at all! My curls are curlier, not crunch, not as frizzy and overall more beautiful than before I used DevaCurl.I have bought this travel sized pack for multiple curly haired friends to try because I know if you just try all the products together you will be sold!

I've been using this gel for years as my go-to hair product. With this most recent purchase, after using it, I noticed my hair looked as if...well, as if I hadn't even showered! I thought, maybe I forgot to apply it...? Next time I showered, I used it again...and it looked like I hadn't used any product at all. Complete frizz. I checked the ingredient list in comparison to my empty bottle and...sure enough, some of the ingredients have changed! This gel does not work any more for my hair. I guess I'll try their other gel, but why, WHY did they have to go and change this formula? Sad!

Hair just finished drying, and I just finished the last step in the directions listed on the product bottle... I am still in disbelief.I spontaneously decided to DIY perm my naturally pin-straight Asian hair last week and since have been realizing i am so unprepared to manage curly hair. I bought some cult favorite products (Curl Smoothie, Pantene Curl Gel, etc) before landing on this gel by Devacurl, and none of the others defined and tamed my hair like this. I was convinced that i didn’t properly set some strands of my perm and that they were just going to be demaged and straight. After using this light gel and following the directions (apply evenly to soaking hair, scrunch with a microfiber towel, dry without touching (!!), then upward scrunch the crunchiness away for soft curls. Did all of the following and i can see every wave and Curl i set in my home perm, giving me back hope that i didn’t totally screw up my hair.TBH i used devacurl last bc i thought it would only work on natural curls and bc it’s a salon product and harder to get than drugstore products. I was totallllyyytt wrong and think this is better for artificial curls more than anything!Totally obsessed, i want to marry it.

I hated my curly hair, it would always just turn to fluff within a couple hours of styling. I mean fluffy to the point people would attempt to pet my head. After trying the deva curl product I’m learning to embrace my curls. They are defined and soft, full of movement. I get compliments all the time now, and I’m feeling better about wearing my natural curves. I previously used Shae Moisture, but my curls weren’t nearly as defined. Make sure you leave some of their conditioner in, squeeze the water out of your hair, blot with a microfiber towel then add enough gel that when your hair dries it’s crunchy. Once completely dry scrunch out the product. You are left with soft defined hair all day.Downside: takes forever to dry. Get a diffuser and set aside sometime.

Absoluletly nothing better for your curly hair than Deva Curl products. I use them all and my curls have never looked better! For years I hated my curly hair. It was frizzy, dried out and impossible to work with. I had tried everything out there than said it was for curly hair and I never got the results I wanted with any other product. Deva Curl has made me love and embrace my curls. I now get stopped on the street by people telling me how much they love my curls and how pretty my hair is. Even my hairdresser has become a believer and is using Deva Curl with all her curly haired clients.

Love this product.  I've used numerous curl products throughout my life (including Eufora and Bumble & Bumble) and this is my favorite as far as results.  It creates a defined curl without the ""crispiness"" that some products create.  My ONLY complaint about this line of products is with the smell.  Its not a fragrance that I like, or can even place.  Whereas the Bumble and Bumble is vaguely floral and soft smelling, this is more anise(?) smelling.

The product worked well for the most part.  The front/sides of my hair had a soft curl, the back however was frizzy.  Not crazy about the scent, but it went away after hair dried.  I have very thick hair that has curly, wavy & straight sections.  Drying it naturally took several hours, so this is not something I can use if I need to be somewhere early.  When my hair dried, it still looked somewhat wet and “crunchy”.  Fingering it out softened if it but also pulled some curl out & increased frizz.  I’ll defin use again... hoping it will get better with practice 🤗.  Price is great as I saw this in a salon and it was twice as expensive.

Still working with this to define my curls. I've been straightening my hair regularly for about 2 years. I am now working on my curls so I'm not the greatest at a good technique. This gel does crunch a lot for me and gets a bit heavy weighing down the curl. I'm using a blow dryer with the curl extension. As I get better with my technique, I would probably be able to have similar results out of this gel than others here. I still think the texture of this gel is very good compare to how other gels feel when you're rubbing it in your hands before applying.

I have naturally wavy hair that I leave natural. This product is nice to have around but I won't be incorporating it into my daily routine. I can achieve the same texture and hold by scrunching and putting my hair in a loose bun on top of my head for 20 mins. It made me feel like I needed to wash my hair every day and I can't do that with how dry my hair tends to be.

My first time using a devacurl product. i like the light hold and my hair doesn’t have those crispy curls after using gel. attached is a picture (my hair is completely dry in the pic) from a humid summer day in northern va and curls are pretty frizz free.  on wet hair i use i.c.o.n. mesh moisturizing styling cream and then add the devacurl light gel. I love the i.c.o.n. mesh, but need a little extra something to prevent frizz.  i’m not crazy for the scent of this gel - i’m not into fruity smells for hair products. also the product is a tad pricey for the amount you get. overall good first experience with devacurl product.  my hair is naturally wavy/curly.

I've been doing Curly Girl for about 3 months now, and just started using this product again.  I didn't like it at first, but I love it now! Maybe my hair was rebelling against the new routine at first (they say that can happen), I don't know, but this gel leaves my hair really, really well defined, yet soft, springy, and voluminous all day long.  My hair is just slightly longer than shoulder length and I only use about a golf ball size glob, total.  I apply it in smaller globs, not all at once.  I also use Curl Keeper (smoothed over like leave-in) before the Angel.  They work really nicely together, imo.I've experimented a lot with different gels and products in the few months I've been doing CG, and nothing seems to nourish my hair, while still giving me a consistently good hair day, quite like this gel. Kinky Curly Curling Custard is the only thing that came close, but I didn't like how soft that left my hair.  I need something with a little texture so my hair doesn't fall flat (I have really fine 3B curls), but not so much crunch that I'm a stringy mess.  The Deva Angel does the trick for me on both accounts.  All I have to do to get a little volume back in throughout the day is rub my roots with my finger tips a little, and poof, I'm back to where I started when I left the house!  I'm so glad I gave this gel a second chance.  I use it in conjunction with the Deva One Conditioner, which I also really like and keep coming back to (even though I keep trying new products).This gel might seem expensive, but I think the quality is well worth it.  I definitely started out thinking products in this price bracket were a splurge, but I'm finding more and more that you really get what you pay for with the Deva products and their natural ingredients.Overall, I highly recommend this product.

I have 3c-4a curls and wanted to give Devacurl a try after hearing other Devacurl product reviews. However, this is NOT the gel for you if you are actually trying to get a ""gelled"" look or replace a medium-hold gel. It is truly a light-hold gel and really did not seem to gave an effect on my hair. Also, it does not mix well with other products. I use Cantu-Leave in Conditioner (which I have loved for years) and combining it with this product caused the conditioner to curdle in my hair (best way to describe it). I also have long hair and felt like I had to use a ton of gel to style my hair. Overall, save your money and try something like TGIN's moisturizing gel.

I have used Deva Curl off and on since 2001. I used to love it. However, something changed in the product when the company has been sold. The products have caused me general hair loss for a few years, and this product in particular has caused me more severe hair loss, particularly in the areas I would use this daily to refresh. Don’t use Deva Curl.After discovering that this may be the reason for my hair loss, I discovered a Facebook group with over 3400 people who have hair loss, scalp issues, and hair breakage all from Deva Curl. I am most definitely not alone.I know it’s Deva Curl because when I stopped the products completely and shampooed with a shampoo with sulfates, the next showers only had a half of the amount of hair loss I had previously been used to.

I have heavy thick hair that wants to curl, but without product, drops to wavy as it dries. Most curl products don't hold well enough for all day curls. I first bought DevaCurl light defining as a lark because it was on a great sale at a salon. It's the best product I've ever owned. I've used it nearly every day for over a year. I very rarely even blow dry and iron my hair straight anymore, which used to be my standard, to avoid the crazy waves. With DevaCurl, I just wet my hair in the shower in the morning, rub the product onto my hair and scrunch the curls, then let it dry, and I have all day curls. It's so much healthier for my hair than the heat, and doesn't dry it out.

I've tried it all and this is the best curly hair product! Rub it in while my hair is still wet and I'm pretty much good to go. While it's not ""crunch free"" like it claims it's by far the least crunchy for the most frizz control. My hair is usually more from then curls but this gel really brought out the curls and the friz is all but gone. Can't recommend enough. I do find myself using a nickel to quarter size amount but I have lots of thick hair that's shoulder length.

Bought this and other DEVA CURL products for my mom who has permed hair. Was visiting her over the holidays, and decided to try it out on my long straight hair. Though my typical Asian hair would not be considered curly (or wavy) by any real curly haired gal, my hair is wavy when it is wet, air dries frizzy, blow dries and brushes out straight, and my dad has wavy-ish hair that has gotten kinky/frizzy as he ages. I thought I could use this product to exploit what waves I have...and it really does work! I didn't use the DEVA shampoo or conditioner, but I followed their techniques (I used this video tutorial on Youtube: Set Your Curls Free For 2011 by WSALONVA)- no wringing or twisting hair during washing/drying, must flip hair over face to dry, scrunching to remove water, and scrunching to apply gel, and using a diffuser on the hairdryer to ""scrunch"" dry.  Because my hair is so long and prone to knots, I made sure to brush my hair prior to washing, so as not to disturb my hard-won waves. But flipping the hair over, scrunching to dry and apply gel really worked wonders! Even for the amount of hair I had, a little quarter sized squirt was all I needed. My hair dried with big bouncy waves that looked like my hair was blown out, and it was soft and shiny without looking product loaded. AMAAAAAZINNNG! And it looked so good the next day that I didn't even have to style my hair. I was unable to replicate the same results with a drugstore brand gel. Unable to say if one could replicate this with a similar salon quality product from another company, but I'm happy not to have to look further. This Amazon price is quite reasonable, and as long as this price is available, I will happily purchase this product. To sum it up: This product really feels and looks natural, while maintaining body.  So if you're a *straight* hair peep- try this. But make sure you use it the correct way.

Deva Curl has saved my liiiife when it comes to my hair. My curls were in quite a funk for a while and DevaCurl has changed that for me.

Pretty disappointing. I saw a girl at a taco place who had the most controlled, beautiful curls I've ever seen. I asked her what product she used, she said ""DevaCurl!"" Now, perhaps I bought the wrong DevaCurl product but this was no better than the 1.00 LA Looks Gel my older brother used way too much of in the 90s. I thought it would tame my wild frizzies toward the top of my head, but no, just exaggerated them. I admit, sometimes, under the perfect amount of not disturbing my hair at all, it will define waves well toward the bottom half of my hair. And for that, I give it more than one star.

Ok, so I have struggled with styling my curls for years, I usually straighten my hair because my hair tangles and breaks much more when curly. I have a weird combination of fine curly spirals that get super dry in the back. I started using this product with a teeny bit of Argon oil (just on my ends) and a diffuser. I have never had such soft touchable curls in my life!!! I did have to play around with the amount and methods of drying... i.e. microfiber towel/t-shirt dry first vs. towel to scrunch out excess product... before I really began to like it. There is also the trial/travel pack which has their No Poo, One Condition, and Set it Free in addition to the gel available if you want to try before you buy the big bottle ;)

My hair is very curly but fine, so I stick with light hold gels typically.  Using this product actually makes my hair worse....frizzy and overly soft and unruly.

I tried the ultra gel, which I hated, so I figured maybe this would be better. I don't like this one either - it leaves my hair feeling icky. Every time I try another gel I keep going back to the Ouidad Climate Control gel, which I like the best. The Ouidad makes my hair a bit crunchy, which is good for making the curls defined and non-frizzy, and then I can squish the crunch out and soften it a bit, leaving my hair feeling normal. The Deva gel leaves this gross ickiness in my hair, like it's dirty and sticky.

I already had a huge bottle of gel, but I got excited when I saw this on amazon so I ordered more. I bought this thinking it was the old formula (the green label with the white swirl shown in the item picture), but the item I received is the new packaging. Devacurl must have changed the gel ever so slightly because my hair doesn’t love the new gel as much - it leaves my hair kind of weighted down and stringy, but I’ve been using it because I haven’t found another that I liked better. I gave it three stars because it’s “eh.” The shipping was quick and the item was packaged well.

I know this sounds like hyperbole, but this gel has literally improved my life for the better. With thick curly hair, I am always worried about frizz.

I love the way this looks on my daughter's tight curls.  While I may not love the scent, it doesn't bother me one bit.  The important part is how nice it makes my daughter's hair while taking the frizz away.  I highly recommend this product!

I love to be in a bind for time...no worries...just use this product and leave the house.  It is a perfect gel and is light enough to scrunch and not be able to tell you ran out of the house.

I was skeptical to use a light hold since my curls get looser towards the end of the day, but this is still lightweight with hold. I love that my morning curls don't look crispy also.

Hair started coming out more in the shower after only a handful of use. It also made my hair tangled, which it never is. I should have started with the smaller bottle. I'm not sure I can return it now. I did more research discovering many others who have experienced hairloss due to devacurl.

This is the product that really made my hair look incredible. I have 2b, not very thick hair, and this works very well to define my waves. I haven’t used any other hair products before this one, so I can’t compare it to anything else. I’m just so grateful that my hair isnt a disgusting frizzy mop anymore. Also the scent is INCREDIBLE.

Definitely a value for your money and doesn't leave your hair as stiff as the extra control. The scent is amazing as well.

This product does define your curls...but the cost is it dries hair to the point the knots get unmanageable and hair breaks into pieces. Not worth it

I haven’t used any other deva curl products but this one. I have been skeptical since this is a more costly brand. However since I’ve been using just this gel...people have noticed. The following morning coworkers noticed my hair was “curlier” vs. straggly. I def can see a difference myself’

Want perfect curls? Here ya go. This gel freaked me out at first because you have to let it dry (airdry or with hair dryer) completely. When it's completely dry, it looks stiff AF -BUT!! Just crush up your curls to break the gel cast and maybe give your scalp a quick massage to shake the curls out a bit and VOILA! Beautiful curls every time.
"
"DevaCurl Light Defining Styling Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Combined with Deva curl no poo and conditioner this product really does enhance natural curls.  My hair is fine, naturally wavy, and there is a lot of it. With these products I have lots of soft curls which last for days. The only down side is that the gel has to be applied to sopping wet hair. Supposedly you can then press out the excess with a microfiber cloth or soft t shirt, but I haven't figured out how to do that successfully without flattening out the curl.
"
"DevaCurl Light Defining Styling Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Pretty great hold and not crunchy like most gels! I mix it with the DevaCurl styling cream, about 25% of the gel to 75% of the cream and I get a really nice hold with super shiny, soft curls. I LOVE the smell.... honestly an amazing scent for hair products.

I fell in love with this gel after the first time I used it! My hair used to be naturally very curly, but started to become more on the wavy side. However, the FL humidity had me searching for better products to bring back my curly hair. This gel brought back my curls in a natural way and hydrated my hair. Good bye straightener and hello Deva curl!!!

Great product however I just repurchased it after finishing my last bottle and the dispenser doesn't work. I even tried it with my old dispenser. Same problem. I don't know if they changed the formulation and the product is now thicker or what but it's really annoying to have to unscrew the top each time and pour it out by hand.

I have naturally curly hair and have tried everything from mousse to gel and back again. Gels left my hair stiff and wet looking. Mousse needed to be used in just the right amount (too little= frizz, too much= greasy looking) and had a hard time lasting all day. I found a curly hair specialist on Yelp and after my haircut she used this product. Yay!!! This gel is amazing! I was worried when she went to use a gel but this stuff is great! It doesn't make my hair slimy, stiff or greasy but controls frizz and lasts all day. I also love that I can still play with my hair some without a disaster.

Love this hair gel. I've had it for about a month now and have used it for severe al different hair styles on wet and dry hair. It helps it stay straight if I straighten it or stay curly if I go to bed with wet hair. My hair stays soft and in shape all day and this gel doesn't dry it out.

I have been using this and other products by DEVA because I have curly hair and it does the job to keep the curls while keeping out the frizzies.  Anyone with curly hair knows how frizzies ruin everything.  I would recommend this to anyone with curls. For years I did everything to deny my curls...even perms to straighten it.  Several years ago I learned of these products and started using them.  Now, I am a curly girl who gets compliments,even from my male friends.

It felt sticky and viscous when I applied it, but the results were spectacular: plentiful and fluffy curls that held up well for several days, including a day humid with rain.

This product rates right alongside every other styling product. It won't make you suddenly have curly hair if you don't already but it does lightly hold, like it says. What I've found that works very well is just a simple heat protection spray and hairspray. The heat protection spray eliminates frizz.

Love it!  No crunch at all. I have very wavy hair and not really curly corkscrew type. I used this all by itself after washing and conditioning with L’Oréal Ever Curl and then “ plopped it” into a T-shirt for a half hour and finishing off with diffuser. I always do that last part so I’d have to say the deva curl made the difference here. Very pretty definition and I like the “dry” consistency of this gel. Some gels are so moisturizing they act almost like a detangler when you run it through your sopping wet hair. This had the opposite texture. It feels like it’s clumping your hair instead and almost felt like you couldn’t tell if you put enough on bc there is no after feel of product like I am used to. Anyway, I’m happy with this and the photo is taken after sleeping on it all night. That’s how awesome the hold is. I didn’t do anything to it this morning except put a pin in the front.

This gel, along with the rest of the Deva Curl line works magic on my hair. Before I had a baby my hair was curly with many ringlets, springy curls etc. After baby my hair changed and I couldn't hold the curl anymore. My hair would end up straight, wavy and curly and look a mess. This product line has given me consistent curly hair with very little straight and wavy spots. Do not brush your hair between washings! You must remoisten a little in the am and twist it a little to refresh curl. Then spray the stray hair. Again do not brush, comb or pick it.

I waited a LONG time before I purchased this gel. I have been using No Poo and One Condition for some time, successfully. I tried a variety of less pricey gels and most recently was liking Garnier Wonder Waves (which seems to be discontinued and is selling for at high price points - which it never did before - on Amazon).Like so many product lines, Deva Curl says its products are most effective when used together (I mean, what else are they going say?!)  My hair is a mix of fine waves & curls and it's very particular - I think it'd be classified 2B or ""cherub"".  Heavy gels make my hair look too sticky or weighted down so I figured the light hold would be the best option.When I first tried it, I would say it made my hair ""fluffy."" I wasn't shooting for - or expecting a ""fluffy"" look. Subsequent uses simply made my hair flat. Bad flat. I've seen in the last couple years since I've been doing the whole curly girl thing just how great & curly my hair CAN look - I mean I know it's possible now, at least sometimes! So to have this pricey gel that's supposed to be so great combined with its friends, No Poo and One Condition, produce such lackluster results is very disappointing. I'm not sure who this gel is for, but decidedly not for me.

Took a lot longer than expected to arrive, but I like this light gel for my 2c/3a curls. I scrunch it up into my wet hair, dry with a t shirt then diffuse, also looks good sans blowdrying it but my hair will stay wet all day if I don't lol.

Best gel out there for a curly girl

Have tried many different products and I like this one the best. I like it better than Deva's Ultra Defining Gel.  This one gives good hold without making your hair stiff, sticky or gummy or weighting it down.  Hair still feels soft after I ""scrunch"" it out.

Very light on your hair. Wish I had bought the more heavy duty defining gel but this still works well. Definitely cheaper than buying at the salon!

I absolutely love this gel! It's not very heavy at all so it doesn't weigh your curls down. It does hold my curly, frizzy hair very well. It reduces my frizz quite a bit and leaves my curls soft and defined. I highly recommend this product!
"
"DevaCurl Light Defining Styling Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I love this gel.  My hair is long and needs a lot of gel to get the curls/waves have any definition.  I usually use the size of a walnut on each ""side"" of my hair after towel drying it, scrunch it, and then use a little more once the hair dries a little.  NOT crunchy, soft, and provides defintion.

"DevaCurl Light Defining Styling Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I used this on a recommendation from my hair stylist to bring out my natural curl. It’s the easiest to use and I love it!

When I first started using this product, I was concerned by how ""stringy"" and flat my hair looked after application. I was concerned it was too heavy of a product for my fine hair.  After it dried and I ""uncrunched"" the stringy look, it was fabulous!  Great control while not leavin behind the stiffness that other gels have done.

I apply this to my fresh-out-of-the-shower damp hair and allow it to air dry. It takes my matted poodle mane of a bird's nest and turns it into shiny diva-licious goddess curls.

You can throw those crusts to the curb!

"DevaCurl Light Defining Styling Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
I bought this after reading an article on the best products for those of us with curly hair.  This was listed in it along with a picture of a before and after. Of course the curls in the after were amazing.I kind of was skeptical reading one lady's review of how this shocked them.  In fact I thought to myself, yeah right.The first time I used it, it did shock me.  It was like a little static electricity zing. It hasn't happened since but I stopped thinking that reviewer had last her mind.All in all, it does a good job of keeping my hair frizz free, and it does define my curls much better than regular mouse or gel, it just doesn't define them as much as I like.I still prefer Miss Jessie's pillow soft curls and will go back to buying that from now on.

Tames my curly curls and frizzies in the high humidity of the Gulf Coast without the heavy weight, greasiness, or still hair feeling of other products. Immediately after a brief towel dry and comb out, I apply one pump, working t through my hair  from the underneath first, then the sides and top. Before drying, using dryer with diffuser, I apply a half pump working the ends up. It styles nicely and my hair looks great. I've also totally dried and straightened my hair either with a round brush and even full flatiron work. Product leaves my hair frizz free and makes styling really easy.

"
"DevaCurl Light Defining Styling Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
Tried No Poo, One Condition and the Angel Gel.  The shampoo and conditioner do cause your curls to 'behave' differently.  The curls are definitely more defined but I didn't have great success with the gel on my short naturally curly hair.  I generally let my hair dry after applying the product on and then lightly lift my curls with my fingers at the scalp to give it a bit more volume.  In doing so it always results in frizz on the top of my hair.  I have tried applying some conditioner and then some gel with poor results.  I am not a fan of this product and after trying it seven or eight times will relegate it to the back of my cabinet.

I really love this gel!  I hate to sound like a commercial, but even if you don't invest in the shampoo/conditioner Deva products, I would just get this gel.  It doesn't make your hair crunchy, but gives a lot of definition and so much shine!  Careful, don't towel dry your hair before you put the gel in, towels break apart your curls and add to frizz.  Just use an old t-shirt and scrunch upwards on the curls, it has made such a difference for me!

This is the best because it doesn't make your hair hard and crunchy. Instead soft, curly, bouncy etc. It also just rinses out with water. This product is not sold at very many hair salons so it is best to order it on amazon. It came promptly.

I'm new to this line of products so feeling my way through it.  Trial and error.  This product keeps my hair feeling soft, but does not come close enough to controlling the frizz.  It is a ""light defining gel"".  I feel that is an accurate description.  Folks who tend to frizz are going to need something a bit stronger.

I have naturally very curly, thick hair. My hair dresser recommended this product and I've happily used it ever since. The curls are soft and manageable. The trick is to not skimp. I had long, thick, curly hair (mid-back), I use the product right out of the shower. Be sure to squeeze excess water out of your hair, maybe scrunch lightly with a towel (sorry, won't spend the money on hair only micro-cotton towels). I just pull my hair into to parts, then one full pump depression, get on both hands and work through the length. Another half pump or so just for the front, and top. Just use your fingers to make sure it is evenly distributed through out(I usually brushing my hair out before getting it wet). Using fingers instead of a comb (even wide tooth) usually keeps the curls big & loose. I just push into the style, maybe scrunch it a time or two as it dries and I'm good to go.

"DevaCurl Light Defining Styling Hair Gel, 32 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","
This product was a big dissapointment. I have very thin, frizzy hair and while it did activate my curls it’s very drying for my hair and leaves it feeling dirty. Worst of all it leaves white flaky residue in my hair similar to hairspray, so I have to wash my hair after each use. Anyone that has curly hair knows not to over wash it as its naturally dry.  I’ve gotten better results from Bed Head products at a fraction of the price.

I wanted to like this, because I'm very happy with the rest of the DEVA line. But it doesn't do anything for my hair. Well, it does do something: it dries it out, makes the curls separate and look dead. I know other people who love this, so it must be hair-type dependent. I (obviously) have curly hair. It tends to do well with products that add moisture. My hair is fairly thin for curly hair.

This leaves my curls soft and flexible but not frizzy. It's the best gel that i've ever used for this, to keep my hair curly versus blowing it out. It is amazing and I've ordered it again already to keep at another home. I would NOT want to be without it from now on. I hope they do not discontinue it as so many companies do. They get something that works and sells and then discontinue. So please don't do that 'Curly Girl'!!!

Purchased after reading ""Curly Girl The Handbook"" by Deva Curl, and I now only use DEVA products in my long curly hair.Using as directed, this truly does hold my curls for several days without feeling 'crunchy'.  My hair stays soft and my curls stay well-defined without getting frizzy.  This does not weigh my hair down - volume stays nice & full.I 'reactivate' on day 2 & 3 by spritzing with water

It is VERY important to apply this product to the hair when it is soaking wet. I applied it in the shower after rinsing out the One Conditioner. I finger parted the hair into about four-five sections AND parted the front of my hair to the side I wanted my part on; and then made sure I saturated and scrunched each section as directed on the bottle. ONCE out the shower, I scrunched the heat damaged areas more and clamped them up with hair clips while the rest of the hair hung free. I diffused my hair on warm/high until it was 85% dry (focusing on the roots and the ends). I then unclasp the heat damaged areas and diffused (try not to scrunch or make that area frizzy). My curls were super defining, not crunchy, and have volume for days! My hair type is 3C/4A with heat damage to the front.

Perhaps I don't know how to use this product properly, however I do not like. Shipping and product came quickly and I am happy with that. I have been using this for several weeks now and I just don't like it. I figured that I am pretty versed in doing my hair.I moved to florida and have been unhappy with how my hair has been lately. I really had high hopes for this product, but it will probably go in the product graveyard under my sink.I feel like this does not have enough hold (even added the curl boost and volumizer for additional hold). It weighs down my hair and makes my hair feel...well gritty. My hair tangles really bad with the product and leaves it flat and lifeless. Tried blow drying and air drying.I find that there are curly hair products for everyone but not all products are for everyone...this one just isn't for me :(

I've tried a few of the other DevaCurl products(Set It Free spray and the foam), but usually need to switch up my products every few months. This has worked well for me, though some days the humidity is too much for even this. Most of the time, it helps give a little bounce and a moderate hold to my curls. I may try the stronger gel in the future, but was wary of it weighing my hair down too much.

This was part of my foray into Deva Curl products...I'm in love with almost all of them.  I started out as an S curl, but since using these products, my hair is getting curlier (I'm sure it's tired of all the Brazilian blowouts I was getting).  This gel is great, but doesn't quite give as much support as I need.  It works great for one day, so I'll use if I know I'm going to wash my hair again that night, but otherwise, it doesn't hold up well enough for ""2nd day hair"".

This is yet another great product from Deva Concepts. My stylist taught me how to use it, and I haven't had any issues with it being sticky or too crunchy. The key is to scrunch it into your hair while it's still pretty wet: you want it to make that squelching noise. I let my hair air-dry without touching it (this is key!) and then re-scrunch when it's dry to break the ""gel cast."" This lets loose soft curls.I don't actually follow the directions to the letter on this; I prefer not to run my fingers through my hair, as it tends to break up the curls and make my hair much frizzier. I just rub the gel between my hands to evenly distribute, then scrunch the ends toward my scalp. This leaves me with big, soft ringlets. It's really made a big difference in my hair. Plus, it smells fantastic!

I have very fine, curly hair and most products either weigh down my hair so much it has trouble keeping its curl or dry it out so much it gets frizzy. Before DevaCurl I had the most luck with Redken Fresh Curl shampoo, conditioner and curl boost spray as well as L'Oreal Leave-In Conditioner for curls, but even that combo would dry it out a bit too much.My stylist recommended the DevaCurl product line & I am so grateful. It is very moisturizing without being heavy & even the most frizz-prone bits of my hair have spiraled into perfect curls. I tried using some DevaCurl combined with the above-mentioned other brand products I already used & that was an improvement, but once I switched to exclusively DevaCurl stuff every aspect of my hair & curls improved. No, Deva Concepts does not pay me. :)Seriously, this stuff works wonders! My curls are very happy with me now.

Love this gel for my curly hair. I haven't found anything even close to it. It disappears and makes your hair seem natural, but continues to hold your curls and keep frizz down.

These products are way overpriced.  You can find more inexpensive products that do the same.  It's all about knowing the process of handling curls.  The no crunch is true for this product and my wavy hair keeps a nice shape however it's still frizzy and actually very drying.  My hair is not smooth or shiny at all.  I have to use other products in addition to get that affect.  Considering how expensive it is, it's not worth it.

I have longer curling hair that is thin. I live in a hot, humid climate and my hair is also frizzy.Deva Curl Angell Hyper-Allergic Conditioning Gel really helps my hair keep its curl, and also helps battle back the frizzies on humid days.If I want to use hot rollers, it is great at adding a bit of extra hold so that the additional curl from hot rollers will stay even longer in my hair.I only use a small amount of this product. I use it on towel-dried, damp hair after I have combed it out starting at the ends. It doesn't take much, so I find it very cost-effective.Highly recommended!~~>> ""I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather. Not screaming like the passengers in his cab."" <<

Like all of you, I've spent a gazillion dollars on hair products that never worked.  Hesitantly I purchased the Deva Curl line (the smallest size) because I figured, ""yeah, another gimmick.""  Let me tell you I absolutely LOVE this line and will never go back to even the most expensive products I've used from the salon!  My hair is VERY curly & tends to be frizzy and wirey.  After the first application I saw a tremendous difference!  I've used Deva Curl for a month now, and I get compliments on my hair all the time!  It looks healthy & not frizzy.  My curls are beautiful, smooth & defined.  Trust me - if you have curly or wavey hair this is the product for you!

I've been a hairdresser for over ten years, and when DevaCurl hit the market it changed the game! This Light Defining Gel is light enough to not weigh down soft, fine waves and strong enough to keep tighter curls in check. I'd start with a smaller amount and gradually add more product, depending on hairs length and thickness.

i bought the trial set to try for my 2kids curls.we absolutely luv the anGEL& when we can't afford the whole set,we can manage just fine with this.their dad is half black&im half Alaskan native so neither of us could use our products for our 2curly headed kids.our oldest has thick thick corse curls &the youngest has fine springs curls &this is the only product we've found that can be used on both curls(altho the oldest has shorter hair cause he's a boy&when he grows it out we need a heavier hold but when its short it works just fine)as long as the youngest dosnt go to sleep for an hour or 2 after her gets washed(perefer it to be done in the morning vs nite because it takes awhile 4their hair2 fully dry w/ or w/out products) it dosnt frizz or flaten like it used to with other curl lines &it don't look crunchy or too oily either.healthy shiny&springy all day long(naps included!)

someone recommended this product to me so I had to try it out and I love it for my 2 year old's hair.  She has cute little curly hair that when dry it is just below her shoulders. Smells great and doesn't leave her hair crunchy has a nice soft hold to it and controls the friz. This bottle is going to last a long time (we got the 12oz). I have thick wavy long hair and this didn't work on scrunching my waves but I figured it wouldn't because my hair is so long and thick. We will definitely order this again when our bottle runs out :)

I have very thin shoulder length 2c/3a hair. I love the Light Defining Gel. It doesn't weight my hair down and produces the best curls I have ever had.My routine to achieve frizz free curls in FL humidity:1. Co wash with As I Am Coconut Cowash2. Use Shea Moisture Conditioner (any kind is fine) and rinse it completely out3. Use Renpure Whipped Coconut Leave In on the ends4. Rake a pea size amount of Cantu Moisturizing Curl Activator through hair and scrunch5. Mix 2 to 3 pumps of Deva Light Defining Gel with 1 pump it Deva MirrorCurls and glaze the top then the bottom of my hair with this mix.6. Take my microfiber towel and scrunch scrunch scrunch and scrunch.7. Let air dry or diffuse on a low setting if I'm in a rush.Simple quick and easy. No frizz

Nice product.  Works pretty good on my very fine wavy hair.  The only thing I don’t like is it makes it so my Hair is stuck together and I can’t run my fingers through it.

I decided to try out the Light defining gel before ordering the Ultra defining gel. Some people prefer one or the other. I can say this gel did not suit well with my hair. For me, it controlled frizz well as long as I didn't touch my hair while it air dried. Seemed to get frizzy when I defused my hair though. Aside from that it felt like it dried my hair out a lot. I would do a deep conditioning treatment and my hair would feel great. Then I'd put this gel on in the shower and instantly it felt like the moisture left. The only way I can describe the texture is if I had washed my hair with alcohol....kinda squeaky and not flexible. I will continue buying deva curl products and trying out what works for me but Im disappointed I didn't just try out the ultra defining gel and saved the money on this product.

I recently learned from my hair stylist that Amazon sellers are not certified to be selling salon products. After learning this, I realized that the product I purchased must have been a fake! It smelled a bit different and I have been struggling with white flakes in my 3b hair, but mainly on my scalp for a while. I was itchy and my scalp was dry. I thought for the longest time that something was wrong with my scalp, but it was the product. I have been purchasing from Amazon for a while and never thought about the validity of what I was buying. Since I purchased the same shampoo from the salon I go to (who is certified), my scalp has significantly improved. Much, much less flakes and itching! (I do live in a dry, hot climate, so some itching from sweating isn't abnormal). Though it is more expensive than what you can get from Amazon, at least you will know that what you are getting is real! Please save yourself the time and money and just purchase the real thing from an actual salon! Your curls and scalp will thank you!

It smells different, and it makes your hair feel different. My hair was listless and dry on the ends after using this. When ordering new products from the DevaCurl website and after one use my hair was back to life. Don't waste your time or money on this product. Pay a little extra to get the real deal.

So, I thought the first time I used it, it did not perform as advertised with my curls (I have Wavy/Medium Curls) and I thought it was because I had just left coconut oil in my hair for about 3 days.  But when I used it the second time, it did the same thing, which many of you are saying; it left my hair looking very dry and frizz all over.  It almost looks like over processed burnt hair.  Normally my curls are very shinny and bouncy.  I don't know about the reviewer that said, she watch a video on how to use; this is not rocket science is Shampoo or No Poo and Condish, she also recommended buying a cream to compliment, wait... I already spent $50 and now I have to buy a cream to make it do what it is supposed to do??? Nah! It does not really smell like anything and I do think like others, I got a used set.Update 4/18/18 - My apologies; there is a science to using this shampoo and conditioner.  First your hair has to get used to it, or get rid of all other build up before it works.  You must apply, and scrunch as it is on, then do the same with the conditioner, finger brushing the hair with head upside down, then rinse with coldest water you can stand.  Never rinse curly hair with Warm or hot water unless you like the Puff Frizz head look. :)- I think it is still too heavy for my hair type and it leaves it a bit weigh down.  I rinse and rinse but still not as bouncy as I would like.  It does leave my hair very soft and moisturize. It may be best for really curly hair, not wavy/curly like mine.  I have gotten better results with the Redkken No Frizz set, I also buy it here on Amazon!

This line has literally saved my curls in every way! I have the thickest, and most course hair in the world! And before I found DevaCurl O was struggling to find the right shampoo and conditioners for my type of hair and scalp. Most of the time the shampoo would be too heavy and cause loads of build-up on my scalp. I love to air dry my hair and I was never ever able to do that because it would be super dry, frizzy, and poof out so bad it looked horrendous! Deva Curl has changed ALL of that for me! After a week of using DevaCurl Decadance I could see the transformation, my hair was shiney and way more manageable. I could air dry it and scrunch and my hair looked amazing and my curls have never looked so great in all my life! I wish I had found this years ago but Im so glad I have it now! And there is no way I will ever go back to regular shampoo and conditioner ever again!! This gives my hair the hydration it craves as well. The smell is so delicious!

I have wavy/curly hair (s curls) and, before someone recommended DevaCurl products to me, I was always struggling with either curl flattening or big-time fluffball effect. Or frizz. Nothing seemed to leave my hair looking decent. I started with Low-Poo and immediately began to see a difference in the way my hair felt bouncier, yet not fluffy and flyaway. With continued use (and I've been switching between Low-poo and no-poo, with my preference being No-Poo with One Condition Decadence line conditioner and shampoo) my hair is healthier than it's ever been and I don't have to struggle with combing out tangles in the shower. It's really an amazing difference. If you're just switching over to no-sulphate products, give yourself a chance to get used to the feel of them. You'll think that they're not really working, or that they're not washing out, but just trust. You will see the amazing difference if your hair is like mine and everything else leaves it either dry and frizzy or too soft and flyaway (and with the curls flattening within half an hour of being outside).

I can understand the appeal of these products and know they work for so many but I’ve tried this line and the original and both made my hair so dry and frizzy!! The frizz I couldn’t handle. The survey on the devacurl site said to try this line as shrinkage is a problem for me. Since my hair is fine I questioned it but trusted the site and should’ve tried the lighter line maybe. I believe my hair likes a little silicone even if it isn’t the best for moisture retention. I just don’t think I’m a devacurl gurl! I am trying the IGK products now and am liking those a lot better!

So far, this is my favorite cowash ever. When I use regular conditioners to co-wash, my scalp never really seems to get clean, but not with this. It is a dedicated co-wash and not a conditioner used to wash hair (I believe there's a difference). I think it's because it contains cocamidopropyl betaine as an ingredient, which is a cleansing agent. So, it's like a lovely conditioner-shampoo hybrid without the drying effects of shampoo and sulfates.I don't usually like to spend a lot of money on something I'll quickly wash down the drain, but this is worth it to me. It starts my hair off on the right foot, which means I can be pretty sure my final styling results will be good. (If my hair wash is drying, it's almost certain that my final style is going to be frizz city).I'm a coarse-haired curly girl and it works great for me. The protein in it doesn't bother my hair, that I can tell. The scent is light, which I appreciate. And I bought it in 32oz because my hair is so thick, it eats 8oz products as appetizers.

This product is horrible! It left my hair dry and brittle! I was supposed to receive one bottle of NoPoo and one of Conditioner, I received two conditioners so thought I'd try it. Horrible results. This is the first product I've ever returned other than if something was broken.

FINALLY a product that works on my hair that isn't outlandishly priced.I have Moana type of hair; thick, some curls tighter than others, and almost as long, and just A LOT of it.  I only have to use 3-5 pumps each showering so these bottles will last for quite some time.  If you have hair like mine, I recommend not washing the conditioner out of your roots since it will go a long way in assisting the dry, frizz that seems to never be tameable in that area when using after-shower products.  If you leave the conditioner in your hair for 10 minutes before rinsing, you will see and feel a MASSIVE difference in the health of your hair. These have a fresh, subtle scent as well.

I'm very upset, I had to update my review. These aren't authentic I only use devacurl and it make my hair soft and takes away my frizz. I've used this product twice, it dries my hair out and leaves it naughty. The texture of how it leaves my hair is like i just dyed it too many times, that damaged feeling. I just want to return them but I opened them already 😢

Well I love devacurl. But I'm going back to my old product. My stylist recommended this one and the first one I bought was really good and this time my hair is much drier and feels strung out. My ends are at their frizziest. I just wish there was some kind of recourse since I'm now out 60 dollars for a fake product.

I tried a sample of the DevaCurl cleanse and I fell in love with what it did for my hair. This was a legitimate product and I am very happy with the purchase. The only issue I had was that the conditioner in mine leaked a little bit as I’ve read in other reviews. It wasn’t a lot but I felt the packaging from Amazon could definitely be better.

The only thing better for my families curls is ... Nothing. I have been using Devacurl products for years and was happy to see this new item. If you are a one condition and no poo user who still needs moisture, they made this product for you. (And me).I also use this for my kids. Ages 4 and 6.

I’ve gotten the Deva Curl One Codition Original, and I loved it, my hair loved it, it was incredible. And when I saw the Decadance on here for cheaper I thought I’d try it. Immediately when I opened it I thought it kinda smelled like a cheap conditioner, but I thought maybe that’s how it was supposed to be. There was also no difference in the cleanser and the deap conditioner. They smelled the same, felt the same, and I’m sure are the same. I’ve been using it for about a month and a half, and my hair has lost its curl, just waves, and is frizzing pretty bad. I used the little bit left I could scrape out of my old bottle and my hair is happy and is curling again. If you do end up buying, just beware of fakes so you don’t have to be a sad customer who spent almost $70 on what’s probably Pantene :(

I did not get the right product as pictured, when I purchased as you can see there is an aqua cap advertised but I received the lime green cap.. unfortunately the product inside is different. I have ordered this product straight from DevaCurl and the green cap and aqua cap bottle is a totally different product even though it reads the same.. I am not sure if the aqua cap is a new formula but that’s the one I wanted. When I received the product I thought oh maybe it’s just old packaging, but upon using it I realized the formula is different. How can this be resolved?

Love it !!!! I never heard there I different types of shampoos by mild level and this no pop is perfect . I don’t miss the fact that it doesn’t lather even though it says to use a good amount I use the size of a quarter (I have this short hair ) and it perfect . You don’t feel a lather but it feels like you are using a very moisturizing conditioner .

Great new summery smell -- only buy if you like the smell of coconut! I have been a DevaCurl devotee for years now, and I found this new formula to be really enjoyable -- very nourishing with a great, lasting smell. Has the same de-tangling properties as the other formula. Nice thick texture -- feels great on my locks. Love it!

I stayed out with the original no-poo and conditioner Fromm DevaCurl and Inloved it! I went to Sephora and saw this new decadence line and wanted to try it since my hair is dry and the woman helping said it would probably be better for me since my hair is prone to dryness. I LOVE what this Duo does for my hair. I have 3b-4a curls and this does a great job with allowing my hair to have slip when detangling in the shower, and for my hair to clump after getting out. On top of mositerizing my curls, the shampoo leaves a refreshing feeling in my scalp and both products are very light which is plus! I’m very satisfied with this combo! I would give this product 5 stars and I recommend it to all of my dry, textured hair persons!

Last year I began on the Devacurl kick! I got the devacut and was gifted a bunch of leave in and no poo. I did like how my hair felt and smoothed during wash day...but there were things I was over looking and thinking it was me. I have had a terribly itchy scalp despite frequent black castor oil scalp applications..I figured it was something else I was using. My edges began looking thin and I again assumed it was my edge control. No. I came across the many youtube videos describing others experiences and the companies lack of explanation or help. I WENT HOME AND THREW OUT MY NO POO IMMEDIATELY! I hopped in the shower, used a clarifying shampoo, my old conditioner (that I was told was too heavy for my hair at the devacurl hair salon) and my scalp magically is feeling much better.....a few itches here and there but not constant. No improvement on my edges yet, I am working on changing my entire wash day routine. DONT DO IT!

My daughter ordered this cleanser first and recommended that I try it. Although we both have long hair, mine is thicker and drier. I only have to wash it about every three days. She washes hers daily. I was mighty skeptical at first- it felt like trying to wash my hair with straight up conditioner. It was strange not to lather up and I fully expected my hair to not look, feel or smell clean. But I applied a generous amount, scrubbed my scalp vigorously and worked it though my hair for about 3 minutes. I then let it sit several minutes while I showered. SURPRISE!!! My hair looks, feels and smells clean, and is much better behaved than when I used traditional shampoo. LOVE IT!!!

I have waist length 3c Curls and just recently had my hair highlighted with bleach and some color.  This left my hair parched for moisture, but using this system every other day, with a co-wash and occasional conditioner leave in, my hair is soft, shiny and manageable!!! I have had the shampoo and conditioner for almost 2 months and I still have about 1/3 of the bottle left!!!If you don't have dry or color treated hair, this product should be used in moderation.  Once a week for hydration purposes at most.Must Have!!

I used to straighten my hair every single day because I couldn't deal with my kinky hair and now I hate my hair straight, my curls are so healthy and lushes again!4 stars-  because the bottle came open and unfortunately a huge chunk fell out BUT can't complain this price is unbeatable! Will  definitely  be purchasing again!!

These products are not that moisturizing.  I know so many people who swear by them, but they don’t work that well for me.  When using the line after 2 days my hair is so dry it’s ridiculous.  I have to add some more leave in conditioner to my hair.  This stuff is too pricey to not really work.  Never purchasing again.

This conditioner was terrible.  My hair was frizzy and dry when I used it, it looked awful.  I finally read the ingredients list and saw silicone.  If you’ve ever ready the Curly Girl Handbook, where the Deva products began, it says to avoid silicone if you have curly hair.  Silicone makes curly hair dry and dead.  I was so disappointed in this Decadence conditioner because I thought it would replace the Deva Care conditioner, which was discontinued.  I’ve since moved to a different product line altogether since the Deva company don’t know what their customers need anymore.  It’s too bad because I’ve been a loyal customer for a decade and hate the idea of moving on.

I have been using Deva Curl for over a year now and I love it!! First, let me say that I do not wear my hair curly. Actually, I straighten my hair on a regular basis but I have thick, coarse, dry hair and this has been the only product that I have found to help tame it down. My hair is always soft and manageable with this product and I would highly recommend it.

My hair salon stylist recommended DevaCurl to me. I have very curly hair and ever since I started using this product I can see how my hair has improved. I now have a thicker mane and my curls are just jumping with volume and strength. Ever since I started using DevaCurl I now have the hair gel, hair mousse, and DevaVurls shampoo.

I've used this for years.  I love it.  It smooths over and through your hair rather than lathers and foams around it, which is very different from traditional shampoos.  Hair gets clean without getting dry or weighed down by buildup.  The few times I've had to use a different shampoo, my hair felt gross and was hard to comb through even after using a conditioner. I have naturally curly, medium thickness hair and this is the best shampoo I've found for it.

I like it. Can’t use all the time as need  to have my hair shaft breathe.  I’ve bought the gel for clarifying as well before. I do like it but since I do need to use a lot of it to really have it work on my thick curly hair, I stopped using as is just too expensive and there are so many covwashes that work just as good I just can’t justify the $. Same with clarifier, leave in etc. the only thing I pay the $ for is their diffuser for blow drying attachment. ,,,, and still that’s a splurge for me as it’s a piece of plastic, with an incredibly high mark up.

Conditioner was a hot mess.  Looked like it exploded within the package.  Cap was not on and as you can see I lost a good portion of the conditioner.  Was not expecting this for the amount of money I spent.  Not sure if it was just a fluke or what.  Over all I do love these products.  My hair has never looked better.

I have being using diva curl for over a year and love how it works so well on my curls. When I first started using it I could tell a difference right away, my curls were more defined and bouncy. I also use the diva curl gel. I could tell right away that this is not the real thing. It doesnt smell the same and it actually lathers. Real DC doesnt leather. I took a chance ordering it on amazon but I will stick to purchasing else where.

I have moderately dense curly coiled  hair and this product does not work well for me.  I have to use  a lot of product just to work it through my hair and it does not  cut through product build up effectively.

This is NOT my conditioner. This is lotion or something. I never thought it would happen to me, but I will be demanding my money back. I use this regularly. The consistency is completely different, it smells NOTHING like the real thing, and literally feels like I’m putting water in my hair. I don’t give a damn what they say, this ain’t devacurl conditioner. Period.

I have been using this duo for a while now. From all Deva Curl duos, this is the best one for my hair, for it is the most moisturizing of their hair products line. I also like that this is the last fragrant of all Deva lines. The downside is that the No-poo feels like it does not clean scalp as much as a regular shampoo or even as their No-Poo Original.

Let me start by saying that I having been using deva curl products for years. I have super tight curls and love how healthy my curls look after using Deva curl.  However, I am not a big fan of this particular deva product. I wanted to switch it up and try something different( I normally use the the classic no-poo shampoo and one conditioner) so I tried this Decadence set. It doesn’t seem to give my curls the shine and healthy look that I was hoping for. It may work for other curls.. just not mine.

I'm not a fan of their styling products (not enough hold) but their no poo cleanser is the best! I've used devacurl no poo and conditioner before with mixed results but their decadence line made me a full time believer!

Good conditioner - one annoying part is that it feels impossible to rinse off your skin with our water type. (Well water)Answer- put it in, wring it out, put hair up in a rubber band, and don't let the conditioned hair touch your skin.I do love what it does to our family's hair- great curls...

I buy this for my neice who has very curly hair. She loves it!!!!!!! It helps condition & keep the curls beautiful as well as smelling great. Perfect product at a great price.

My daughters hair is a nightmare. It’s frizzy but curly and it’s frightening to try to deal with. This literally takes her semi-Afro and turns it into sleek curls....if only the accompanying hair cream from them had actually arrived.

Highly anticipated using both products since 1) I have 3c hair, and 2) my hair took so well to the original No Poo and One Condition.... I've washed my hair 3 times since receiving these products (tried to give it a 2nd and 3rd chance), and my hair is not responding well at all... 1) I have to use wayyy more of this product compared to the original. 2) The first use was by far the worst dectangle I've had in 8 years of being natural (the 2nd and 3rd weren't so bad). 3) Unlike the original One Condition, I was not able to use this conditioner throughout the week as a 'curl refresher'; it left my hair feeling like there was a film left on it. ....I gave it 2 stars bc I do like the scent, but my hair has not enjoyed the Decadence products at all :(

Pretty sure this is either diluted or a knock off. It barely smells and absolutely doesn’t work. I use this product regularly on my daughter, and this version from shine on beauty is definitely not the real deal. I didn’t open it until the other bottle ran out and now I am out of the return window. Not happy.

Did not receive the decadence shampoo. I got the regular ""original no poo"" shampoo instead. It's not that I dont like that kind... but I paid more to get the decadence.... oh well I guess. It stinks but my hair feels amazing.

Unfortunately, this is not what it claims to be. It has no smell (Devs Curl products have a strong smell) and it really does nothing for your hair. Don’t by this product!

I like how the product is a little cheaper than in the store... but, when i got the product the bottle wasnt even filled to the top with conditioner and the cleanse. Why isnt it filled to the top. Its alot thats not even filling up the empty bottle space..... Im not mad im just disappointed...

Im giving this a 1 because i cant give a 0 star. I used this product for 5 months. Over those 5 months I started to notice some extra hair in the tub, then a little more. Suddenly one day I take a shower I had handfuls of my hair. Multiple handfuls. Im devastated as i now have bald spots. I advised looking twice and really research before using this.

I purchased this on a recommendation and am very happy I did. I have thick, curly, frizzy hair. The shampoo and conditioner left my hair clean, so soft, and smelling great. The duo were shipped on time, as described (1 shampoo and 1 conditioner) and double wrapped. As a matter of fact, I am going to buy another set from this same seller!

A mi en lo personal no me funciono este shampoo! Ya había comprado este shampoo en ulta, pero la fragancia era diferente , y aparte le daba brillo en el cabello a mi hija ! Pero cómo es caro decidí comprarlo aquí . Lamentablemente no le cae bien a mi hija y ya no lo puedo regresar y aparte es bien grande he invertí mucho dinero .

My hair is somewhere between 2B and 2C and this product works very well for me. This shampoo itself detangles my hair, which never happened with any other shampoo.  Sometimes hair masks don't detangle my hair.I've purchased a set of shampoo and conditioner twice already and I am very happy with both.

I'm addicted. I had a bad problem with my scalp breaking out with normal shampoo and conditioner. Ever since I've been using this, no problem at all. I thought it would make my hair greasy, or oily.. NO! I love it. My hair is soft! Def worth the money I spent!

I've been experimenting with different curly hair products for the last few months.  This is a winner.  I ordered the largest size.  My hair is a 2c or 3a and can frizz a bit on top if I'm not careful.  The Decadence is heavier on the conditioner.

I made sure that I bought the decadence Devacurl duo, well I got was the devacurl original instead of the one I purchase and have been using for quite some time now.  The Deva curl Original are ok products, not the best thing in the world  for my super curly hair really.  Im just disappointed that I didn't  get the products that I know I paid for.

This would be 5 stars (I really do love this product), but I got 2 bottles of one condition instead of one bottle of no poo and one of one condition. Which wiuld be fine, except I am out of no poo and will now have to get some ordered or go pick it up at ulta for a much higher price. I guess I will not need to order any conditioners for a while.

My curls are so defined and maintain their shape now. They are so soft and bouncy! I use the coconut supercream after towel drying. Stick with it, you won’t see results after the first use but over a few washes, your hair starts to maintain its natural oils. So worth the money!

I ordered in March 2017 from the seller czbm and just pulled out of my linen closet to use. The product is fake- doesn’t have the same smell or consistency of authentic devacurl and the label is a bad dupe. Fake is on the left in each photo.

First of all, I have coarse wiry non-color treated red hair that is probably 2a in terms of waviness. It tends to be dry and it damages easily with or without heat styling. I've been struggling to find the right shampoo and conditioner for my hair that reduces the damage and makes it a little softer for some time. Prior to this shampoo I'd been using Pureology Hydrate shampoo and conditioner for about a year as my hair feels as though it's been color treated but it didn't seem to help all that much.While this product is made for women with curly hair, I decided to try it on mine, hoping it would help keep my ends from getting crispy dry and that it might ease some of the wiriness. Lucky for me it has really made a difference! My hair has a little more weight using this shampoo, but for the texture of my hair, that's certainly not a bad thing. It's also emphasized my slight waves and has given them more definition when I air dry (and even more if I diffuse). I've noticed a significant difference in the way the ends of my hair feel over the month that I've been using it. It takes longer to blow out my hair straight due to the added product in my hair and I have noticed that I use less product overall with it. The one that I've been sticking to is Kerastase Touche Finale-- it's really just enough.It also smells wonderful, so wonderful that my fiance uses it on his <1"" stick straight hair. The pumps work great, and the size of the bottles/duo shipment gives you some value on a fairly expensive product (it's nowhere near as expensive as Pureology though, so I'm laughing to the bank). If your hair is anything like mine, I'd highly recommend it.

I've always been happy with DevaCurl products and this one didn't disappoint. However, I do not have oily hair and I wash my hair 2-3 times a week, so if you wash it more often, you still might get dry hair.

I use this product on my 2 year old mixed child's hair. He has very tight corkscrew curls (when properly cared for!), which if not washed daily get extremely dry and frizzy. Deva curl is AMAZING. I have found a certain way that I use the cleanser and conditioner for the maximum corkscrew curl-age from top to bottom! I shampoo it and let it sit for about 5 minutes while he finishes up playing in the tub. Then I don't quite rinse it all the way and add in the conditioner and again, let it sit for another 5 minutes. By the time I'm ready to rinse (again, don't quite rinse it all out) I can run my fingers all the way through. I'm super picky about his hair and Deva Curl Decadence is WELL worth the money (I'm also a single mom...so tight budget!)

I've experienced hair loss And noticed more flakes in my hair  since using this product. I'm not so sure this product works for all hair types and the sad thing is I heard such good things about it & it was super expensive I feel the need to use it until it's gone.

I started wearing my hair curly in March of 2015.  Since that time I've become a bit of a product junkie, not by choice, and had several BAD hair days!  After trying product after product, I was becoming a bit disappointed.  Then a friend told me about DevaCurl.  I was a little hesitant to invest in it due to the price tag.  After buying a ""starter kit"" at ULTA, I was hooked!!  The cost to buy a 32oz of the No-Poo and One Condition together is about $30 less from this seller.  Also, I find that using the no-poo 1 time per month works much better, it can be slightly drying if I use it too often.  I don't need to use as much product or leave-in when I use the One Condition by itself on most of my wash days.  My hair retains more moisture and the natural oils from my hair keep it hydrated.

I love deva no-poo and it's been a huge game-changer for my hair, but this stuff smells terrible. Kind of like baby powder/dove bar. I get that some people like that, but if you're not into those scents I don't recommend that you use this stuff. I had to add rose geranium oil to my bottle in order to counteract some of the smell. Otherwise it works about like the original stuff did, and gets the job done. I wouldn't say that it does a better job by any means, and I will be purchasing the original formula for my next bottle even though it costs more.

Its fine. Other reviewers have commented on the scent. It's a bit odd but I didn't mind it. The scent of regular no poo is odd too in a totally different way but after years of using it I don't mind it. I will go back to regular no poo though because my hair feels more conditioned with it.

I rec'vd the set of No-Poo and Conditioner.  I like it.  The scent is light and clean.  The formula does seem to glide through my often very tangled 3C curls and offers good de-tangling as well.  I am not a giant fan of the price for this, but it is a very good product that will not build-up on your hair.  It seems to give my curls a good start for the styling process, and a good foundation does allow my curls to last 4 to 5 days between washings.  That said, if you use it only 4 to 5 times per month, I suppose the price dissipates as it will last me well over one year.  Depending on the amount you use per wash/condition, it may last a longer or shorter amount of time for you.

I've used the Deva Curl and Deva Care for years- Love them! At first I wasn't in love with this, it almost seemed to leave a coating on my hair and I felt like it was getting oily... I'm not sure what has changed, but I really like it now. It leaves your hair smooth and untangled. Smells great too. I wouldn't say the results are significantly different than the other 2 formulas for me though.

I was so excited to try this line. I have dark, thick, frizzy, curly hair. Been using this product for only a week and I won't be continuing, my hair doesn't get clean and is oily and gross by the end of the day.Smells good and the conditioner is great but the shampoo not so much. Love the scarf after I figured out how to use it. Which is why I gave it at least 2 stars.

Kind to hair and health, this shampoo does not contain all those terrible additives that threaten our health--parabens, phthalates, etc.  Be aware that it does not suds and froth as typical shampoos do, but that is the healthy result of the lack of nasty additives.

As someone who suffered with frizzy hair, I'm ashamed of myself for taking so long to take the Deva plunge.I wasn't sure what products to get, so I grabbed these and the difference was immediately noticeable after just the first use. Now that I've been using it regularly the changes in my hair have amazed me, and it's nice to have curly hair instead of a frizzy mess.

I've used the original DevaCurl No-Poo product and thought I would order this kind as it's supposed to be more moisturizing.  Well, it works fine....but IT STINKS!  The scent of this product is reminiscent of old lady's perfume!  It's too expensive not to use and it does last a while so I'm stuck with it but I won't order Decadence ever again.  The original No-Poo smells so fabulous, along with all the other Deva Curl line, but they really bombed on this one.

Ordered with amazon and got exactly the same product I got from DevaCurl directly for a much better price.  I love them to death! Just to test it out I used this on my normal wash day. But for my mid-week wash I used the regular versions of the One Condition and No-Poo. My hair instantly felt drier than it did after using the Decadence versions a few day prior. This stuff really does work. I have 4a,b, and some C hair. I use coconut oil and the regular styling cream and my hair is extra happy all week long. I actually have not had a need to put any oil directly on my scalp as of late. Just and fyi.

The product did detangle my hair and left it very soft. However, the downside to this product, is that I had to use more than I typically would with the original DevaCurl One Condition and Cleanser. I am definitely not a fan of the fragrance which reminds of downy fabric softner!

Items arrived with masking tape (the yellow tape) over the top of pump dispenser. Product had leaked on both the shampoo and conditioner bottles.  The shampoo smells identical to what I purchased in salon, but conditioner feels and smells different. My hair is now frizzy and dry - with salon purchased product (same product) my hair was not frizzy, was hydrated, and felt soft. Amazon customer svc is amazing and did refund my money, but please know the conditioner is a fake - not original Deva Curl Decadence you purchase in salon!

Less drying than the original, but doesn't leave my hair gunked up or weighed down like some other no-poo/co-wash products I've tried. I love it! I use it on average about 1x/week and it's just cleansing enough that I feel clean, yet not so astringent that my scalp overcompensates or feels dry/itchy over the next few days. I have medium- to low-porosity hair that tends towards a dry scalp with dry hair in my native CA climate. 10/10 will continue to use it!

I love this stuff and won't use anything else. I have oily, slightly wavy, fine hair that I wash daily because I work out daily. I have to scrub my scalp like with a regular shampoo to keep it from looking stringy after my hair is dry but it gets my hair clean! The most miraculous thing I've noticed since I started using this shampoo a year ago is that I no longer get split ends - and I blow dry my hair straight almost every day! Even my stylist, who sells Aveda products, comments on how healthy my hair is since I've started using this shampoo!

Have used No-Poo for a very long time. This formula seems to be even more moisturizing for my long, thick, 3C hair. I miss the peppermint smell/feel of the original, though. This is a bit more floral/fruity.

If you're doing the Curly Girl Method, there's no better place to start than here. I thought that I could get away with doing cowashes with just any conditioner (and some people can - when done right!) but my buildup was crazy. I finally gave in and bought No-Poo and with only a quarter-sized amount my hair feels cleaner than it ever was with shampoos that contain sulfate.

I use to love Deva Curl & was using it for over a year. Then I started to have clumps of hair coming out & after months of trying to figure out what was causing it, I went on vacation & decided not to pack this but took other travel size products. Low & behold, the very first time I used a regular shampoo, I stopped losing hair & it has been growing back nicely ever since. So even if it works for a while, beware of potential hair loss.

I'm am a Devacurl devotee and have been using the original no-poo and one c for years on my 3b curls. My hair is loving the decadence line. Once I cleanse and condition, I use the conditioner as a leave-in/styling cream along with the ultra defining gel.  The result is bouncy, shiny curls.  I really love the smell too.

I love this product. Heard about it leaving too much buildup or it not making hair feel clean,I'd say if your hair feels that way it's cause you don't have dry hair. Decadence is perfect for my hair . No poo leaves hair feeling clean and one condition leaves hair easy to detangle and so soft and my curls come out much bouncier from root to ends . Big difference from the very first use. I absolutely love it !

There is no way this could have been a Devacurl product, I've been using one condition and I love it (as I do all devacurl products) but I ordered this because it is suppose to be more moisturizing...not! This made my hair feel like straw and would not get the tangles out, it didn't even smell anything like devacurl products, I returned the product and will not order from this company ever again!

I really wanted to like this product and I'm sorry to say it just doesn't work for me.  Quite frankly, I absolutely hate it and can't wait to be done with it.  My hair feels so dry and is so frizzy which is exactly what I thought this product would prevent.  I suppose I shouldn't have strayed from things that were working for me to begin with.  Lesson learned.  I'm glad other people have found this to be a good product but I was extremely disappointed and will not be purchasing it again!  The first picture (in the tan sweater) is before I used this shampoo.  My curls are tight and smooth the way that I like them.  The second picture(in the blue shirt) is using the shampoo.  My curls are stringy and frizzy!  I will go back to my drug store brand shampoo/conditioner for certain!

I really wanted to try this. I am a Deva Curl fan and hoped this would be better during the dry winter. Unfortunately, I recieved Deva Curl No-Poo and One Conditions. NOT DECADENCE. I had to return it and then had no shampoo and conditioner. Very disappointing and a waste of time.

Smells like the weird hair products I used growing up that were greasy or thick and never did anything for curls or dry hair. But I've gotten compliments on the smell!! It seems to work just as well as the regular deep condition and no poo for tight curls but those smell better, like lime and stuff. I love Deva curl but this smell reminds me of bad hair times, sorry! Just wanted to be honest and wonder if anyone else had the same Stop correcting ""experience"". Cant describe the smell either. Its not 'botanical' or anything. Overall though, great product really.

This shampoo is the bomb! I have tried zillions of shampoos to help calm my curly, coarse, frizzy hair. The shop gal told me this has more moisturizing and conditioning than the regular Deva no poo shampoo. She was right. I could tell in the shower there was going to be a difference. I am not exaggerating - my hair feels like silk. You will not be disappointed.

Originally I received the Devacurl Decadence No-Poo and One condition in a curly hair holiday kit. It was my 1st time trying their products. I definitely love love love the No-poo cleanser. My scalp felt so clean after using this but my hair still felt moisturized, not stripped at all, but not weighed down either as I have fine hair. The One condition from this line is good also. But I don't really care for the smell and after trying the original one condition, I like that one better. It smells like candy but not overpowering and has  more moisture than the Decadence One Condition. It is still a really good product and I will definitely continue to use it in my hair routine. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the smell of the One condition but the No-Poo cleanser smells great.

I REALLY wanted to like this product, but unfortunately, it's now high on my list of worst products ever used on my natural hair.  I purchased it a couple of months ago, but wanted to finish my other product before trying this.  I have used it twice and it dries my hair out and leaves it very frizzy.  I will not use it again or make another purchase.  Apparently, I've made a $50+ donation.

I would love to give this 5 stars but unfortunately I can't! This stuff is horrible!!! I thought it would be nourishing and all it did was make my hair feel extra dry. The conditioner was no good either! Anything that makes your fingers or hands feel dry is no good! Not worth the money or the hype ☹️️

This shampoo is great! I like how it cleans my hair without the lather. If you put a generous amount on your hair and focus on the scalp for about 5 minutes you will notice that the cleaning process is easier. The matching conditioner is great for detangling and if you want to deep condition. I put more on my ends so they can get full moisture without frizzing.

Ordered the original no poo and got the decadence so gave it a try. Do not like the smell but much worse, it completely dried out my scalp. I started to get dandruff and an itchy scalp. As soon as I switched back to the original, it went away. Nothing decadent about dandruff.

You know for the decadence line, I expected more but my hair was reaaaal dry after I washed this stuff. My next wash day is Thursday, so I'm gonna try again but if not I'm returning it.Update: so I used a little bit more and it wasn't as dry but it was still dry. HOWEVER, omg I put my conditioner right after and my hair has never been so soft and easy to detangle in the shower. There was NO dryness everything was just smoooooth.Now let me explain my routine a little. I do not use shampoo, instead I cleanse with apple cider vinegar/water(1/2 of both)/2 drops of peppermint oil. I have a problem scalp and nearly ALL shampoos dry out my scalp and only SOME give my hair the moisture it needs. There has only been one shampoo (Shea Moisture Deep Cleanse) that has delivered both moisture and controlled scalp for me. I do my cleanse twice, to last me 4-5 days (I can probably go longer) then follow up with my conditioner(SM JBCO). When I got this no poo it was my deep conditioning day and my conditioner did not deliver the amount of moisture it usually does which was concerning and seemed obvious to me it was the no poo. I now see that it was simply because I didn't put enough (need at least 25 pumps tbh).Also note I asked Devacurl if Amazon was a Verified Vendor of their products and they said no. This also means the one I've recieved could either be expired/bootleg/watered-down. Sooooo I will be buying the no poo decadence from Deva Curl themselves and see if I get better results.Update: I'm back babies, after having washed my hair twice with the no poo decadence from my local Ulta (veeified vendor). I have noticed, very little difference. I do only use 16-18 pumps with this one though. Could mean I got a watered down one or could mean after using around 36 oz of no poo my hair has become more manageable, which I agree. So I would say user discretion. At Ulta it was around $47.48 (tax included).

This is the absolute BEST for my dry, curly, color-treated hair. I use it year-round -- only occasionally substituting it with an Argan conditioner or deep conditioner -- but it's the best in winter when everything gets really dry. I use a cotton (not terry) hair towel that I purchased here on Amazon to scrunch and pat my hair after using it. I hang my head upside-down and gently pat and scrunch upwards to take the wetness out of my hair. Then, let it air dry with some leave-in conditioner and/or a small amount of Argan oil. I also occasionally put an extra dab of the One Condition in the lengths of my hair after rinsing and gently wringing as a leave-in conditioner. I highly recommend this stuff, especially if you've already used the original One Condition but need a little more moisture. I probably wouldn't recommend this to people with fine hair. It might weigh it down too much. Just remember to use it sparingly. It doesn't take much.

Although I have wavy, not curly hair, I have enough hair for two heads and there is enough frizz and unruliness to make me want to try something different. I have mostly used shampoos for dry and frizzy hair. They were better than the alternative, but still left me with a lot of extra effort to look presentable. I bought a small bottle of each the cleanser and the conditioner. I first used the cleanser alone and I thought my hair texture (especially around the scalp) improved significantly.However, there is a learning curve with this product: it does not sud because it does not contain surfactants (chemicals that clean by stripping the surface), so this means if you’re used to conventional shampoo, it will be difficult to figure the cleanser distribution over your hair. I have long (below mid back), abundant hair, so I needed a copious amount (“generous” as the label states is a gross understatement).I suspect it will take many uses of this cleanser and the accompanying conditioner to use it to its best advantage but so far I am encouraged by what I am noticing. Frizz is there, but the texture is improving.I liked that the scent is not overpowering.

Even as a seasoned CO washer and curly girl, this No-Poo took some adjustment. I've used Deva products in the past and always felt that they dried my hair out more than I liked (and to be fair I like A LOT of slip) so I mainly stayed away from them. But, like so many other sad curly girls, I was forced to experiment with other brands when Tresemme discontinued their Naturals line (why they did that I'll never know, but I *will* hold it against them until the day I die) so I decided to try out Deva's new Decadence line, hoping it would make my hair happier than their ""normal"" line.The first few times I used it I was not impressed. My hair still felt drier than I wanted, but I thought maybe I just needed the matching conditioner - after all, the label does suggest that if your hair is very thirsty, you'll want to follow it up with a conditioner. But I was lazy and didn't want to drop another $20 on a 12 oz bottle of conditioner that I might not even like, so I kept using the No-Poo on its own. Well lo and behold, after about a week of near daily No-Poo washing, my hair actually started to feel soft again!There was definitely an adjustment period, both for my expectations AND for my hair, but I'm quite happy with the No-Poo now. I finally ordered the One Condition Decadence but that's a different review :) If you're not loving the No-Poo, my advice is to: a) keep using it - don't give up on it after one or two washings, b) experiment with not rinsing as thoroughly!!! This made a huge difference for me, c) try a conditioner afterwards (ideally the One Condition, but whatever works for YOU), or d) maybe it truly isn't for you. (Not necessarily in that order!)Hair, and especially curly hair, is a finicky thing!

This was absolutely NOT Deva Curl in the bottle.  The No-Poo May have been, but the One Condition smelled like alcohol or another chemical.  Hoping it did not damage my hair.  I washed it out as soon as I noticed something didn’t smell right, but broke out itching anywhere it touched.  I guess they were hoping I didn’t notice after smelling the No-Poo. I ignored reviews about it not being authentic assuming it was people from Deva Curl trying to deter people from buying it elsewhere, but I can say now they were right.  So disappointed.

My hair feels great after using this and the conditioner straight out of the shower.  Even before applying any products after washing my hair got more curl definition ad less frizz than with other products like SheaMoisture and Aunt Carols Daughter.  It also doesn't leave my hair feeling dehydrated after washing and air drying so I can wash it more often which is nice since I work in manufacturing and can sweat a lot.

I've used sulfate-free shampoos before, but as soon as you apply this, you know it's different. It doesn't ""lather"" when you apply it and you use the water to move the product throughout your hair. The most amazing thing about this product is that it doesn't feel like it's stripping your hair. After rinsing, my hair felt more moisturized and softer than before I started. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars for me, is that I don't feel my hair is completely clean, but I have incredibly thick hair and I may not be using it 100% correctly. Love the product overall!

Switching to a sulfate-free and silicone free routine has completely transformed my hair into defined curls instead of just a frizzy mess.  I use decadence no poo and conditioner with the ultra defining gel and once a week I deep condition.  I would recommend looking up the curly girl method for styling tips or going to a curly hair salon for a tutorial as its how we use the products that make or break the results.

I really like this product. it is creamy, glides through hair easily, smells great, and really leaves my hair clean without drying it out like regular shampoo. I was instructed by my stylist to apply it and wash my scalp, then just run my fingers through my hair so not to tangle up my curls and rinse. It works great. Of course, I still must condition after.

I have been trying the CG method for over a year but had minimal results. My hair has been more manageable but my curl had not returned. After doing some research I discovered I have low porosity hair. This was a recommended product for low porosity hair and I have definitely noticed a difference. After three months of using this I actually was able to let my hair air dry and leave the house! No curling needed!

I was very hesitant to switch away from the original No-Poo cleanser since I had been using it for over 7 years or so, but I was unable to find the 1 liter bottle available.  I have no regrets at all!  This cleanser has a much milder fragrance than the original no-poo.  It leaves my hair feeling very soft and moisturized.  My hair is fine, and it did not weigh it down for me.  I will be sticking with this cleanser from now on.

I have fizzy curly hair. I went on a mission to see if I could find a product that would allow me to just air dry naturally and not be a slave to the flat iron on weekends.

I don’t even wanna give this one star! Reading the reviews i was hesitant on buying these but i did anyway, HUGE mistake. these products must be expired or watered down... i compared smell to my other bottles & it smelled the same and the consistency was the same. But when rinsing out of my hair my hair was a GIANT frizz ball and i’ve used deva curl for the past 3 years i’ve never gotten these results. I put a deep conditioner in my hair and i will sleep with it in tonight hopefully my hair isn’t frizzy when i rinse it out! don’t buy. just buy from ulta.

This is great for dry hair even if it’s fine- makes my daughters hair so beautiful - I don’t rinse it out only put it on her ends and it keeps her curls in tact! The line is great- I use it on my hair too- but it’s better on her curly fine hair- and I use it every day and only wash 2 times a week with the low poo or no poo- great product for mixed hair

This is not real devacurl. I purchased from the ctual devacurl website and then purchased from here. The smells are much lighter from this seller than they are from devacurl. The first purchase I made from this seller seemed great but then they start replacing the good stuff with the bad. If you have curly hair always buy from devacurl so you KNOW the product is real!

I can not get enough of the DevaCurl Decadence line. I love this line so much more than the original. It has helped my hair bounce back and my hair looks so much healthier now since I've switched. I will say the No-Poo and Conditioner feels thin in consistency, but they both have great slip. The No-Poo also cleanses my hair without stripping it. I use these products 1-2 times a week, depending on the weather / scalp needs.

This Deva Curl No Poo Cleanser is amazing!  I love it  I love that I am not putting harsh things on my hair and it is still clean!!  I personally don't even need a conditioner because the cleanser also conditions my hair.  If I just scrunch it in, my hair has a nice curl to it.  This has a very nice smell of peppermint.  Overall, I am very impressed with it and have used nothing besides this since I bought it!  Very happy with it!!

I LOVE this set. I have 4a/4b hair and after using these products I have less frizz and more defined curls. I detangled and styled with my Denman brush, and I love the results. To make these products ""work"" for you, you have to find the right combo of products. I would suggest trying other products in the line. The scarf is HUGE. Very pretty and very soft! It didn't fall off my head while sleeping on a satin pillowcase. I will be ordering this set again! (My items arrived arrived wrapped in plastic inside a bubble mailer. At first I was disappointed because it looked like it could easily spill out, but I was pleasantly surprised as to how in tact everything was!)

Found this product in Ulta and then did some research. All the reviews were good so I bought the .No Poo shampoo and One Conditioner. So far it has really helped me keep my hair softer and not so frizzy.  Definitely get a micro fiber towel to dry your hair after washing - it also helps with the frizz.  I never use a regular towel anymore.

I've stood by this shampoo for a couple years now and it hasn't failed me yet! The coconut version is new, I got it because it was cheaper than the older, non-coconut version in the same size, and it was pretty much exactly the same. Feels good, smells nice, keeps my hair clean without stripping it of all the oils it needs to be healthy and stay in nice curls. Would recommend, especially if you have curly hair!

The conditioner works nice but the shampoo was not all that. The hair didn't really feel clean. I wouldn't suggest it, not worth the price.

Like a watered down WEN, my hair is dried out!  I bought this thinking it was half price of WEN.  Now I had to order the WEN, thick creamy conditioner.  It has watered down, thin conditioning treatment.  Curls are ok.

I have soft and fine curls and have been using Deva No Poo for quite a while very successfully. Not only does it cleanse my hair well, but it also nicely softens it so I don't need to use conditioner.Based on predominantly good comments on Amazon of Decadence line I purchased No Poo Decadence and have to say that it is nowhere near the quality of the original No Poo. Wish I didn't spend money on it. Will go back to the original product.

Excellent products for those with extra curly hair.  This brand has varying products for different types of hair, from wavy to very curly.  Makes stubborn curls behave and leaves hair healthy looking and conditioned. The price point was excellent as well.The products arrived on time with no damage.  Very pleased and will be ordering again.

Love the decadence for my 2B/C 3A curls. Doesn't weigh my hair down, but keeps it from getting tacky.The bottles I received had the cream spilled out of the pump part of both bottles, so shipment could be better

This was a life saver for my daughter(and me). I know longer have to hear that she hates her hair. She has very thick, coarse curly hair. It is so worth every penny. Her hair looks great. Will buy again. Plz don't ever stop making this stuff. The entire line is amazing

I often order the no-poo and conditioner at the same time. No problem with the no-poo but this last shipment the conditioner arrived with a funky smell. I think it must be old because I had an old travel sized one I had stored away and when I used it it had the same rancid smell as my recent shipment via Amazon. Not sure how to tell where it was shipped from but now I’m leery to order it again.

Glad I bought it! It works better on my curls than the regular Devacurl No-Poo. I don't even need to use the Devacurl conditioner because it's so creamy that it cleans and moisturizes my hair all in one. Will not go back to the regular Devacurl No-Poo.

My absolute favorite shampoo! I'm a product junkie so you can only imagine how many shampoos i've tired. I always tend to get organic products because my curly hair is already extremely dry so I try to avoid all the chemicals. This is the only cleanser I've used that doesn't dry my hair and you can instantly feel how smooth your hair gets when you rinse it out. Will definitely repurchase!

Made my curls 10x better and I was using Mixed Chicks products before this. I used both products with the Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner for shiny defined curls (3b/3c hair) that lasted me the whole week before I need to wash again. Worth the price.

I have been using Deva Curl products for a while now and love them but I do not care for the Decadence product.  It has left my hair flat.  I typically have wavy hair that I blow dry with a diffuser and with the regular Deva Curl I comes out curly, the Decadence product has been leaving it too flat and it's barely wavy.  Seeing these products cost a lot, it's usually worth it, but now I'm out $64.00 and will have to go back and order the regular.

Decadence is giving this white girl with short curly hair the moisture her hair has been craving. I ,have been using most of the Deva line product for several years but what a difference the Decadence is making.  I want to stress I do have short hair, usually between ear and chin length, and I am a white female.  The only reason why I stress this is because I read and read reviews and did not find one from anyone like me.  I also watched videos and did not find any like me for Decadence.  All though, I learned a LOT from all the reviews and tons from the videos and thank all of you-I have changed some of my process's due to your great input!

I love DevaCurl products - they have totally transformed my wavy/frizzy hair into beautiful soft wavy curls. Using the DevaCurl method, not only does my hair look better, but it has grown more in the last six months of using the product than in the last six years of trying to grow out my hair. My hair no longer breaks with brushing (since I no longer brush but instead use my fingers and wide comb if necessary in the shower.)My one-star review is not for the product, but for the seller. As another buyer indicated, they received only one bottle, not the ""duo"" as stated in the advertisement. I recommend buying from another Amazon seller, an Ulta Beauty supply, or your local Deva Curl salon.  The seller claimed they could not find my order number, so Amazon will have to take the hit for my product return rather than the shady seller.

I have been using these products every other week since my October purchase.  I have two years of cozily 4a curl growth, am 51 , and have about 5% greying hair.  I have notice substantial moisture retention and strength in my hair.  I use the styling cream from the same line, and I finally have curl definition that shows the beauty of my coils.  I have been on a healthy hair growth journey for close to four years.  I have used lots of products in my lifetime, and I have found these products, along with two other ones, that will help my hair thrive in good health.

Update- I have a friend that loves this product. She was disappointed with my review of it. She told me to watch the You tube video of how to use it. I thought she was crazy. But, I humored her and watched the video. She also gave me her devacurl styling product. BIG difference. I always scrunch my hair when I'm done conditioning- but the staying cream seriously is the kicker with this. My curls are defined but not crispy at all. Just defined curls. If you buy this shampoo and conditioner spend the extra $15 to get the cream or the gel. I'm telling you, it makes a difference. I canceled my return on this product.This is not a good product. I have very curly hair and it has made it more frizzy than ever. It's basically like washing your hair with cheap body lotion. It doesn't smell very good and isn't worth the money at all. I'm in the process of returning it.

I'm a long time DevaCurl user with thick, 3c curls.  I decided to try this new decadence line and prefer this conditioner to the original.  Worth a try if you are already a fan of One Condition.  It does seem a bit heavier, so it may not be as desirable for anyone using it as a leave-in whose hair goes limp with a heavy product.

I have never written a review before but feel so strongly about this that I have no choice. I saw other reviewers warnings about this not being an authentic product. There were so many other reviews that were positive that I hoped it was just a bad batch. However, I was wrong.... oh so wrong.It arrived on time as promised. I was a little leary based on the reviews so I opened both bottles and they didn’t smell bad so I ran up and showered and used them. I used them both and got out of the shower and realized my hair smelled like I had just gotten a perm! I thought maybe it was just me but the smell kept getting stronger and stronger. I used some hair gel because my hair is curly and was going to let it dry naturally. I went downstairs to get some work done and my mom yelled out “why do I smell perm products?” I about died as not only did my hair smell bad my scalp was starting to tingle.I immediately had my mom help me wash my hair again and I scrubbed and scrubbed. It’s been 30 minutes and my scalp is still tingling and I feel like I still smell like perm. I’m going to have to was my hair again tonight in hopes that this doesn’t make my hair fall out.

I bought this a while back before my salon bought Deva Curl product ran out because my hair was doing great.  My curls were soft, bouncy, and not frizzy.  Now that I am using this one purchased on Amazon, I have been feeling my hair extremely dry, brittle, tangled, and it is not soft.

BUYER BEWARE. If you take your chances and buy anyhow, check the package as soon as it is delivered.As soon as I opened the Amazon box there was a strong spicy incense type scent. I assumed that it was from wherever it was packed and ignored it.45 days after delivery I finally finished my last bottle of Deva No Poo Shampoo (purchased at Ulta & great to the last drop!), so this morning I opened this shampoo and was immediately hit with the same spicy scent - strong enough to trigger my asthma (I have issues with perfumes).I decided this scent wasn't for me, but needed to wash my hair so I put it on anyhow and immediately had a weird tingling sensation, like when using peppermint oil, but there was no peppermint scent or cool sensation.... just the tingling. I immediately rinsed it out and did a clarifying treatment (left-over Ouidad product I had). 6 hours later and there is still a spot on my scalp that feels sunburned.I only took the chance because it stated the manufacturer was DevaCurl and was being fulfilled by Amazon.

I was willing to pay a premium for a really excellent hair product. But, this isn't it. My hair does not like these products at all. They are so thick and hard to even get out of the pump. They are difficult to distribute throughout my thick hair. And even after I finish with both of them, I feel like there is a sticky residue left behind. I'm accustomed to conditioner washing to prevent shampoo friction, so it's not the lack of suds that is the problem for me. I just don't know why this didn't work for me.

I do love the smell and texture of both the no-poo and conditioner. However, my hair continued to shed, and eventually started coming out at an alarming rate. It wasn't until I went out of town for a week and forgot my DevaCurl products and was forced to buy a dupe that I realized, hmmm, is it possible the DevaCurl was making my hair fall out? I've been using the dupe product (RenPure cleansing conditioner) for about six weeks now and my hair loss has been drastically reduced. I am losing only about 1/3 of the hair I was losing before, and I no longer have to pull loose hairs from my head during the day. I will say that for about four weeks I was doing castor oil masks on my scalp and hair a few times a week to help regrowth, so maybe that's what has slowed my hair loss. I haven't done any castor oil masks in two weeks and my hair loss is still at an all time low. I noticed that my hair is much softer now when I touch it, whereas when I was using the DevaCurl products my hair felt very dry and brittle.

Buyers NEED to scroll down and read the description!  The picture and top of page description are deceiving. The product actually being sold is called DevaCare NOT DevaCurl. They are made by the same company, but DevaCare is for colored hair and is fortified with more Vitamin C. The product description further down on the page states this, but the picture and top of the page description/heading leads you to believe that you're purchasing the DevaCurl product that you can buy at the salon.

This is NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT! The shampoo usually leaves my hair feeling so soft before I even put the conditioner in, but this one had my hair feeling so dry, and brittle, literally felt like straw!! My hair started coming out, EVERY time I'd run fingers through it or comb/brush it while wet to detangle, so much of my hair was coming out that it looked like I cut! This product is terrible, don't waste your money or your hairs health. Just order from DEVA CURL !!

Many people have complained about this product is a fake, but it is not. If you read the label carefully it says Deva Care which is for chemically treated and/or colored hair. If you go to the Deva Curl website you will read about the two different products - Deva Curl and Deva Care. The color difference between the two is from the orange peel extract that is added to the shampoo and conditioner for chemically treated and/or colored hair. I love this product and will continue to order it.

I don't have curly hair, but I do live in a super dry climate and my semi-wavy hair is always frizzy and fried looking.  It helps not to shampoo every day, but my fine, thin hair starts looking oily and flat very quickly.  So I decided to try this NO-Poo approach and have found it to be very helpful for keeping my problem hair in good, shiny condition.  It gives my hair a clean and moisturized appearance without the harsh detergents that are so damaging.I highly recommend this product to anyone who has fragile hair, even if their hair is not actually curly.

I don’t have curly hair, but heard this was a great gentle shampoo for daily use so I decided to try it. My hair is a lot softer after making the switch! My hair tends to get oily fast, this non lathering shampoo makes it feel clean and soft without stripping it, and the conditioner is nice too. All smells pretty good although I get a whiff of sunscreen when conditioning every now and then. After switching to this product, I got a trim and stopped using a hair dryer, now I only use a soft t-shirt, my hair is growing in faster, and thicker. Highly recommend it! The book, “The Curly Girl Methid” is what got me into this new healthy hair regimen.

My go to hair washing duo. Other shampoos left my hair frizzy, and my scalp itchy. I tried No-poo once, and I have never gone back. I know they are expensive, but I can't go back to other shampoos now that I have tried it. My hair has never looked better, and I no longer have bad hair days.

I have wavy hair and after using this product for a while I've been getting so many compliments on my hair, something that's never happened before! This shampoo enhances my hairs natural ""wavyness"" and makes it look like I've spent a lot of time on it when really I've just rolled out of bed. It also smells great and will last you forever if you buy the large bottles!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have used DevaCurl for years and was really glad to find it for such a great price. However, when I received the bottles some of the No-Poo and Conditioner had oozed out inside the plastic bag they are shipped in and when I removed the bag to clean the bottles off I immediately noticed that they did not smell AT ALL like the shampoo and conditioner. I still had some in my old bottles in my shower so I compared... and the consistency, smell, color, and feel was all wrong. I am 99% sure that what I was sold was not really DevaCurl No-Poo and One Conditioner. Returned.

If I could give this product 6 stars I would!!! I’ve been searching for a brand that compliments my curls perfectly for years, one that I wouldn’t need to put any product in my hair after the shower to tame the frizz and get the curls to look right. With DevaCurl I just hopped out of the shower and let my hair dry naturally, it’s frizz free and my curls look stunning!! I’m very pleased and will buy this brand from now on!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I think the deva curl shampoo and conditioner is making my hair fall out!! Every time I shower I little have a hand full of hair come out of my brush and when I run my fingers through my hair even more hair comes out! And I haven’t worn my hair down curly in a little while but I swear it feels thinner. I asked My stylist about it and she said you lose 100 strands of hair a day and if I only wash once a week then it’s 700 coming out at once but I don’t believe it. And I’ve been reading a lot of reviews about deva curl making hair fall out. I’m stopping this product immediately and I wish I could return it.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I've been using Devacurl forever and I love it, so I have nothing bad to say about the product. However, the packaging in this shipment didn't have any air bubble buffering in the box. The box itself and other items in the box, were not damaged. Unfortunately the duo pumps were damaged and a good bit of product is in the package and box. If this wasn't something I needed immediately, I would go through the hassle of returning it and reordering. I understand that sometimes things go wrong in the shipping process. I am just disappointed that I paid for the large bottles and so much is wasted and there is no way to contact the seller.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
The fact that I use this product on my 3 year old and bought the big bottles just for her hair is why this makes me upset. I of course am guilty of not reading the reviews because I thought it was fine due to the manufacturer name being devacurl. I just bought them...there was no distinct scent when I  pumped the shampoo in my hand but as soon as it hit her wet hair it was a very strong incense smell. I immediately had my mom look up the reviews and now I am very upset that someone would make fake product using their name and labels. Very disappointed momma here!! Hopefully the return process is easy so I can get my money back and go buy the real stuff at ulta.

I love, love, love the DevaCurl line. I use their No-Poo, their conditioner, their Ultra Defining gel, and their styling pomade. The No-Poo and the conditioner have a nice floral smell (in my opinion), and they both have a nice creamy texture. I was using Redken before I switched to DevaCurl, and I was really disappointed with how loose my curls seemed to be. Once I switched to DevaCurl, my curls bounced up so amazingly well that even my stylist commented that my hair seemed to be getting curlier every time she saw me. I highly recommend the DevaCurl line to anybody - curly hair or straight. My mother has straight hair, but she switched to DevaCurl because it wasn't as harsh on her hair as regular shampoo. She loves the fact that she can go several days now without her hair becoming super greasy. When I purchased this set, the bottles did come with a pump on each bottle (no regular caps), but I think it depends on which seller you buy it from.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Because this product doesn’t have all the chemicals in it that you were supposed to avoid if you have curly hair is probably doing more good than I know. However I see zero difference when it comes to moisture in my hair using this product. As soon as I am done with it I will not be buying it again.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I've been using this product for months.  This must be my third purchase from this seller and I will continue to buy here and use.  This shampoo makes my hair really clean, soft and manageable. I have wavy, course hair that tends to poof out during humid weather etc.  This Shampoo helps my hair with the humidity and just keeps it clean until I want to wash it again.  This may sound bad but with this shampoo, I could probably go a week without having to wash my hair, though I don't...  Shampoo works great and smells great.  I love it!!!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This is fake Deva Curl. I was using it for months with terrible results on my hair before learning that fake Deva Curl is rampant on Amazon. I switched to a new set of products I ordered directly from Deva Curl and my hair is back to normal within days. I have no question this is fake Deva Curl. I have been using unknown ingredients on my body for months and that is alarming.

DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
In an effort to remove chemicals from my daily routine (and help my wavy hair) I found the DC product line & have continued to reorder. I have less hair breakage/loss when shampooing & my color doesn't wash out like with other shampoos (even the sulfite free stuff I used to use). Since this stuff doesn't dry out my scalp, my skin doesn't over-produce oil anymore so I don't get greasy at the roots like I used to after a day. I really can't say enough good things about this product & highly recommend it to anyone with color-treated hair or a dry-slash-oily scalp. Happy customer here.

My girlfriend is an advocate for WEN but wanted to work another product into her hair care routine. She is growing out her natural color and is trying to get her hair as healthy as possible. This product came recommended by a friend and my girlfriend loves it. It gives her hair a noticeable shimmer and I happen to like the scent so win/win. You also get a very large quantity.This product is a little pricey by my standards but I am assured that this is a great value for the price. The girlfriend loves it and assures me she will buy it again when it runs out.

I have struggled with my ever changing curls for DECADES. I had gotten to the point where I'd just let my hair fall limp and then put it in a bun. Every. Single. Day. It was so damaged and lifeless.  I just had no hope for having nice hair again. Finding this shampoo and conditioner has been a godsend. My curls have never been softer, healthier or more consistent. I just couldn't be more pleased. The smell of the shampoo is wonderful and I use the One Condition as a leave in.

This is not the real product. My daughter turned me on to DevaCurl by gifting me a set she bought from her hairdresser. This product doesn't smell or work the same. Will only purchase from salon from now on.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I LOVE this stuff!! I have been using WEN and it is great stuff too. I wanted to try this brand because it is a bit cheaper and has great reviews.  I won't be going back to WEN!! My hair is thin and the curls aren't really tight, just soft. This stuff made my curls curlier, spiral and calm!! I don't love the smell but I have had a few people comment on how good my hair smells. To me it smells a bit like chemicals, but not bad kinda like when you get a perm? This is the best my curls have been and i love it. I also use Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Gel and it is great together!!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I bought this shampoo and conditioner by accident.  I didn't understand that DevaCare is for color treated hair, and I meant to buy the regular DevaCurl products with the green label.  However, the products both work just fine for my dry, curly hair.  I don't find them to be too heavy or anything like that.  My only complaint about these products is their smell.  They smell like a rotten creamsicle.  Then again, I'm 7 months pregnant, I'm very sensitive to smells.  I love the way the regular DevaCurl products smell, so I'm disappointed that these are so different.  On the positive side, the shampoo smell doesn't linger, especially after I put product in my hair.  Smell aside, I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is soft and hydrated.
"

I bought smaller  product just to try it out to see if it was as good as I had heard. The first day I couldn't see the difference but the second day it was amazing. It smells great ! I am a huge fan of great smelling hair.  When I got the bottles I was a little disappointed in the size for the price, but the product was so great I bought the 32 oz large bottles of the shampoo and conditioner. absolutely love this product and highly recommend it for anyone with curly hair.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
5 Stars for the product - 0 Stars for the Seller.The product in general is a great product! I highly recommend it. However, the items purchased from this seller are questionable. The shampoo was fine. The conditioner appeared to be an opened item and was extremely watered down. It was so runny, I could hardly hold it in my hands. I've purchased this product from a salon and beauty supply store so I know what it should be like - not runny, but thick. Upon opening and dispensing for the first time, the product was already loaded and ready to go, unlike the newly packaged shampoo which took about 5 pumps before anything came out.I'd look elsewhere to buy this item - just to be sure I get what I actually paid for.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I can't wait until this bottle of shampoo is gone. I bought the wrong stuff, clearly, as I too, prefer my shampoo to lather. I recently got some new (and different) Deva Curl stuff from the Deva Curl company and it's much, much better - including the conditioner.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This is listed as DevaCurl one condition and no poo and is pictured as being the original, but it's actually DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition Decadence. Anyone with curly hair knows that the shampoo type can make a huge difference, and the Decadence is much more moisturizing which means if you don't have super dry hair, it makes your hair incredibly greasy. I requested a replacement item thinking maybe they had just sent the incorrect item, but the replacement was the same, so it's actually the product description that is wrong.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love this shampoo and conditioner set. I've used it now for almost a year and my hair has never felt heather. I have naturally wavy hair, and no matter what I did, I'd end up with a giant fluffy mess. This product has tamed my mane, and my hair has never looked so shiny. I get random people on the street complimenting my hair. That NEVER happened to me before, I feel so proud to have joined the ranks of the good hair day people.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
 The product run out of the bottle and the scent is just awful, like incense or something. Just seems like the seller changed the product inside. I don’t recomend and I’m about to ask Amazon for refund this item. The smells is so strong that dont get out of my hands even after washing a lot.(I dont speak fluent english)
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Beware when you buy these, because mine were fake. In the products I received, both the ""No-Poo"" and the ""One Condition"" had the same smell, which was also really nasty, and they looked and felt the same when they should be different. My hair, which loves the real DevaCurl products hated these and was a frizzy mess. I called DevaCurl and they said the products I got are most likely a knockoff. I thought I was saving money but I was actually wasting it on products that did more harm than good. Do your hair a favor and buy from DevaCurl directly or find an authorized seller.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I am VERY irritated!!! It is my first time trying DevaCurl and it was only just delivered for me. I have natural hair that is very very thick, dry, and needs lots of moisture. I was excited to try the Original product and was instead sent the Low Poo and Delight conditioner. I DO NOT need Low Poo, I purchased Co Wash. and I certainly don’t need a lightweight moisturizer for wavy hair. I wouldn’t be so pissed off if it wasn’t so expensive. Don’t charge me $60 and send me the wrong products that won’t work for my hair.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love these products and I will use nothing else now that I've become so familiar with how to use them and how to style my hair. I highly recommend that before using these, read the Curly Girl book so you know exactly how these products should be used. So many people have commented on how healthy and pretty my hair is. I've even had hairstylists that I don't know come up to me and exclaim on how perfect my curls are so I'm loving my hair. In addition, the devacurl styling products are also very good and when used together.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
My hair always lacked moisture and I was always frizzy. This has helped my hair to be more natural without the frizz. I can wear it curly and down without being self conscious of my big hair.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Love these, I would agree that the packaging seems a little sketchy -- they came in a box with tape over the pumps, and it looked like my conditioner had slightly less liquid in it than the shampoo. They smell ok and were a clean white color, so do seem to be the same product that I have purchased before. I also saw these exact bottles in CVS recently for $41 a piece - this is a great deal on amazon!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
While this didn't 100% work for me, I still gave this 5 stars because it was my fault, not the product's . I meant to order the low-poo since my hair is so oily and that's what I had last time, but I bought this by mistake.This stuff is wonderful for those with curly or wavy hair. My curls have thrived since I switched to this line! The only thing I really have to say about it is if you do have hair that is prone to being really oily, make sure you get the low-poo and not the no-poo.My husband has curly hair, too, and he decided to use this when he ran out of his own products. He uses this now, as well, and he loves it too.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This product is very moisturizing, but not great for wavy hair. I think it would probable work perfectly for someone with coarser, curly hair. But it is too heavy for looser curls or waves. Would recommend buying if your hair is super dry or damaged. But if you don't have the super spirally/kinky curs, this might weigh your hair down and actually take some of the wave out.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"

"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I really didn’t care for this shampoo and conditioner. I’ve used foamless shampoos before and absolutely loved them, so I was really disappointed with this product.  It left white residue on my hair and scalp no matter how much I rinsed and made sure I got everything out.  I could scratch my head and there was a white film in my fingernails- really gross! The package also came damaged with about a quarter of the product spilled all over the box, which was a shame because this was pretty pricy. I ended up buying a different product and have had no issues.  Pretty upset with the wasted money on this.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I don't want to sound dramatic here, but this haircare set changed my life! I've been using DevaCurl for just over a year and it is amazing! My curls look great for a longer period of time and I feel great knowing that I'm not stripping my hair with grocery store products. The fact that the shampoo doesn't lather does take a little getting used to, but now I cringe at the thought of putting ""foaming chemicals"" on my hair. The lathering effect is just that...an effect! It does nothing for your hair.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
DevaCurl Apparently changed their formula since the last time they bought. The shampoo smells like roses and dust. The conditioner smells like lemon floor cleaner. Such a disappointment. I used DevaCurl exclusively until I couldn't afford it anymore and splurged on this and now I smell gross and my hair is falling out. Hooray!

Shampoo & condition duo helped my curls regain their life after years of straightening and coloring. My hair has ways to go but in the short amount of time I’ve used it (since feb) I have seen my curls regaining their shape etc. love it & will continue to purchase.
"

I used to love this product but they changed the formula to a horribly perfumed version and now I get a migraine every time I use it.  I wish they would go back to the orange cream version.  If anyone knows how to get some of the original version, please let me know !!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love the way my hair is soft, curly, never frizzy with these products. I do notice some dander-looking stuff by my scalp (may be the moisture lock spray in the line), and I do find that it looks dirty a bit faster than other shampoos. I normally wash twice a week, with dry shampoo on the last day. For those noticing a lot of build-up, there's a reason that the whole line doesn't contain silicones--don't use sulfate-free shampoo like this and think it'll remove products with a lot of silicone.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love devachan products. I used to use this duo a couple of years ago, but was concerned about the price and switched over to a different brand. I noticed that my hair has been super dry this winter, so I thought I would give devachan another try. Definitely worth the money ! Curls have been super moisturized and glossy lately. You can also leave in the conditioner and or use it when styling your hair.

This is the BEST PRODUCT EVER ESPECIALLY FOR CURLY HAIR! I have been using this product for over a year now. It has completely changed the way I treat my hair. I no longer use regular shampoo or conditioner.  I have defined curly hair. I no longer lose serious amounts of hair while I’m in the shower! I love the scent, the way my hair looks and feels! I have nothing but praises for this product and it’s line of products! It’s worth the money. You will not be disappointed! I promise, I even have received COMPLEMENTS FROM MEN!

I love these products so much! I've tried so many different products for curly hair over the years and by far these are the best.The 'No Poo' is great as both a cleanser and a conditioner, i honestly don't really need to use the one condition i think i just do out of habit from years of that Shampoo + Conditioner routine. In saying that i also totally love the one condition too. Both products leave my hair smelling lovely and feeling super soft but without turning my curls into a frizzy mess!I tend to use as little as poss so the bottles end up lasting me a long time and i think its better for my hair too.Wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to anyone with curls.

This product is perfect for my botticelli curls.  My curls have come alive.  It is important ot use the product correctly.  I swear by my Curly Girl Handbook with DVD.  For less than $10 you can earn to care and style your hair the way it was meant to be.  I use to fight with my curls to straighten them out to look like every one else.  Now I get so many compliments and remarks about my sassy, sexy curls!  I LOVE MY HAIR FINALLY!!!!!!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love this product and it seems to be the only hair care products that don't make my hair straight or wavy. I have naturally curly hair and I was looking for a product that would maintain those curls without me having to use gels or moose. This product did that and I absolutely love it! It also smells very good which is always a plus. The only downside that I find with this product is that it doesn't seem to make my hair very soft. I have VERY dry hair and these products don't seem to maintain the moisture in my hair, although my hair is very curly. I easily fixed this by applying some Moroccan oil after showering, so this really isn't that big of a problem. I definitely recommend this product for people who want naturally curly hair.
"

I am a guy with naturally curly hair. I do not like spending time on my hair or using any products other than shampoo and conditioner and I prefer using all natural. People always tell me my hair is my best feature and I really like this product. It does keep the curls and helps me be as absolutely lazy with my hair as I like to be. I literally don't even use a brush or a comb ever. I just wash and shake and let the curls do their thing. This is a great product for that.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This didn't work well on my hair. I felt like my hair was so much drier and more fragile after switching to DevaCurl. It made my hair look curlier, for sure, but a drier and frizzier curl than it was before. My ends are also in worse shape after my switch. I'm swapping back to the Tigi Bed Head Resurrection shampoo/conditioner duo. They're not specifically curly hair products, but they keep hair much more moisturized and healthy looking.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Mid-2014, beginning with No-Poo and One Condition samples and discovering a hairdresser who specializes in curly hair,* my hair waved and curled without frizz for the first time since I began puberty. Furthermore, my grey hair, obviously a different texture than my remaining black coffee-colored hair, isn't out of control anymore.  This packaging, Devacurl Original Kit with No-Poo and One Condition, 32 fl. oz., was the best buy I could find at the time of my initial purchase in March of 2015. Since I've been exclusively using these two products to clean/prepare for about three years, and my hair remains healthy and happy, today is a good time for an honest and complete review.When I began using Devacurl, my un-processed hair was just past my shoulders. Now, it's about halfway down my back. I was surprised to read reviews from people whose 32 oz. bottles didn't last that long.  (Of course, the conditioner is going a little faster, and I have always wondered why manufacturers don't make conditioner bottles a little bigger...!)I press down on the No-Poo pump most of the way a single time, lean over, and work the No-Poo through wet hair, starting at my scalp and going through my long hair. One pump's worth is all I need. (Scrunching all of my hair on top of my head as in shampoo TV commercials just tangles it.)  Without suds, I'm rinsing by feel, and my hair is quickly rinsed without any slimy residue. My hair is already beginning to curl.  I press on the One Conditioner pump a single time, working it through my hair the same way and paying extra attention to the lightest gray, which is around my face.  It sits for a few minutes, and then I rinse it out.  My hair feels soft and smooth.  These two 32-oz bottles (No-Poo and One, one each) are just emptying now, two years and five months later.The only product I use post-Devacurl is a cheap, homemade curling gel made by boiling flax seeds (a friend of mine found the procedure online and I've modified it to suit me) and adding a few drops of essential lavender because I like how it smells. If I need to run out, I've got some of the gel watered down in a spray bottle, which I keep in the fridge so that I can spritz my hair on my way out the door. Instant recoil.This past week, both a stranger in the local coffee shop and the file clerk in my attorney's office surprised me with compliments on my curly hair. I'd just left my house that morning without doing a thing beyond removing the ponytail scrunchie in which I sleep. (Running late that day, I'd even forgotten the flax seed gel spritz mentioned above.)I began using salon-quality products before Amazon.com, before Internet was available to the general public, and before specialty stores open only to hairdressers opened their door to all. That's a lot of time to try out a lot of shampoos and conditioners.  I have tried cheap products, mid-range products, and products that cost half a day's pay.Bottom line: I have found Devacurl to be the most affordable and the BEST product I have ever used._____*Yes, there are such specialists, and the lady we found in New Haven County, CT charges approximately what my friends pay at other, non-specializing salons. She is worth every penny. The other ladies in her salon, before I decided that only she will ever touch my hair, have only used Devacurl products on my hair. Furthermore, when I tell them that the only product I use is the homemade hair gel, they tell me that it's what their grandmas used.

Love love love this product! I have 3b curls. Lots of volume with a variety of different sized curls but not quite coily. Because I tend to have seborrheic dermatitis flare ups, I am not one of the people that can skip washing my hairOtherwise I get a lot of build up and flaking. This has worked the best for my hair and scalp by a long shot. Its soothing on my head and smells great! Leaves my hair feeling moisturized. I have tried the decadence line as well but it didn't do much for me. I did not find it moisturized more. Every curly head is different so it might work for someone else but I would definitely recommend this to someone with hair dryness or scalp issues.

I bought these as a recommendation from my hairstylist friend who swore this stuff would ease my frizzy/frail hair problems. and boy was she right!!! I have been using these for a few months now and my hair has never felt so healthy! My hair is naturally very fine/thin but now it feels way strong and nourished. I couldn't be any happier with this and will buy again and again.

Love this product.  Great for my hair and worked really well on my baby's curly hair, too.  Only problem, the shampoo majorly leaked in transit.  I know these things happen, but it was a bummer.

DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Great products. I won't continue to use them because I've found other products more suitable for me, but I definitely recommend this for anyone starting their curly girl method. The difference on my hair is amazing! I pair these up with the ultra-defining gel. As a 2B type, I was recommended the ArcAngel, but that product was not for me. The light defining gel worked just fine and it was very light, but I personally need more to get definition to say; which is why I switched gels. I may continue to use the ultra defining gel, because I love it so much! I leave most of the conditioner on post shower and scrunch in the gel as I go. On days 2 and 3 the hair tends to still look great if I use the pineapple technique for going to bed. If anything goes wrong, I recommend using the Mist-er Right or watered down conditioner to get your waves to wake up from their slumber.

LOVE these products. My curls are so healthy and full of life since switching to Deva Curl vs other brands I've used like Tresemme or Pantene. The large bottles last me about 8 months, and it's definitely worth the price for the quality (and I'm a server so I can't usually afford to splurge on expensive hair and beauty products.)

This product was recommended to me by a few moms of little girls with curly hair after I had asked what can I do to detangle my daughter's hair.  It was totally matted, no shine or body to it, no curls, just a total mess.  I received this product and first used it on myself.  I have straight hair, but it needs help too.  It worked great on me ... BUT, it worked miracles on my daughter.  Not only did her hair shine, NO knots, but I have never seen her curls look the way they did.  I did put a little conditioner in her hair as leave in as well.  I thought the smell was like Dove bar soap, which isn't bad ... and the smell diminishes once hair is dry.  I cannot say enough about this shampoo and conditioner.  My daughter's hair is very coarse, very dry, very knotty ... and this product is truly a miracle.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
One of the reasons that I bought the Deva no poo original formula was because of the Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil ingredient. It felt wonderful on the scalp when my hair dresser used it in the salon. Well, I can't smell or feel the peppermint in this no-poo original at all, it does not exits.  It's a pity.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
It has changed my life and my hair of course. If you have any type of curly hair, STOP using soaps that make a lot of foam because it dries up your hair making it frizzy. Look at the ingredients too. This made my hair so smooth and nourished. Also, read the instructions to get it right.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Do Not Buy!! Used on 3 different heads of curls and this product made them all feel dry and brittle after the wash. The conditioner did not help. Waste of money.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I couldn't believe it when I washed my hair the very first time, my hair looked and felt like it just got a cold gallon of water when it was lost in the desert. My hair was very dry and frizzy. It was impossible for me to ever leave my hair out and natural after all the years of flat ironing (shudders). This gave me such a confidence boost that I started recommending this along with ANgel to any one who had no love for their curly hair. These products has me looking at people with straight hair like ""what the heck did I ever see in straightening???"". Now I get people looking at ME and wishing they had my hair. I WAS born with it and it's definitely not maybelline.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love love love love the no poo and the conditioner . I relaxed my hair last year with a mild cold relaxer so my hair is halve curly (3b/3c) and halve Relaxed. I v been Using these duo for a month along with ultra defining gel plus a weekly silicone free deep conditioner and my curls are back and my hair is unbelievably soft and bouncy . great product and I strongly recommend 😊
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
After I shampoo my hair and rinsing it thoroughly. I put the conditioner in my hair and I don't wash it out I either can style my hair or let my hair dry.  my hair is gorgeous curly or flat ironed it's a great product.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have been converted!! I've been using normal shampoo and conditioners all my life and could never understand why my hair was so frizzy and curls so flat. Now my curls are soft with minimal frizz (I would say none but the second day gets a little tricky which is not this products fault; I just haven't learned how to take care of them yet). I've told everyone I know about these products because I love them so much!!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love how soft it makes my hair! I was using Kinky Curly( and I still love it), but it makes my hair too crunchy. But definitely will be repurchasing DevaCurl! Oh and by the way if you have any coupons please email me some because it is a little expensive!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This stuff is amazing. I got a sample of DevaCurl in a Birchbox long ago, but didn't receive enough to determine if it was really any good. I've recently decided to move towards the ""no-poo"" movement, mostly because I have very long, fine, wavy, dry, colored, difficult to manage hair and washing it is a pain in the you-know-what. I also wanted a healthier, sustainable hair care option. I wash my hair once a week. Enter: DevaCare. I decided to try this instead of DevaCurl because my hair is more wavy and is also colored. Plus, the combo pack with the conditioner was a steal. I can tell these bottles will last me months. I use so little product compared to previous brands, and it goes so far. Especially the conditioner!!  The smell is lightly reminiscent of orange, but not overpowering. It rinses out easily and leaves my hair feeling so soft. I don't have tangles after the shower anymore!!! I was worried these would leave my hair slightly oily since they're so moisturizing, but I can still go a week after washing without any problems - maybe just a little dry shampoo now and then. If you're thinking about switching...do it! You'll be so pleased. I do recommend washing less often than normal if you are a frequent washer. This shampoo/conditioner will allow you to do that, but you have to let your hair adjust to it which may take a couple of weeks (shorter for me because I already washed so infrequently). Buy some!!:)
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love this stuff! My hair smells good, my curls are bouncy, I am so glad I purchased.EDIT 9.12.16 - I have to edit my review, this leaves product buildup in my hair like no other - probably due to the lack of shampoo. Even though the curls are bouncy, I feel the buildup on my scalp isn't worth it.

I have purchased this product from devacurl website. But since its available on amazon i made this  purchase and i regret it.It seems to be different.My hair looks dry n frizzy and i have a lot of hairfall.I suggest you make the purchase on the devacurl website.Definitely its not same.
"

I recently reviewed the decadence DevaCare , I got this one and that one mixed up . Decadence conditioner is a little heavy for my fine hair , this one is perfect . Please read other review , Sorry  I tried to go back and edit but I was not able to . The other product is good but a little heavy for fine hair.  This one is the one I use , for the rest of my curly headed life. Absolutely LOVE IT !!

This is the only ""shampoo"" and conditioner set I can use with my curls. This is a great deal, too. I've found that the pumps that come with these are hard to use, sometimes the head (the part you press down on) doesn't pop away from the rest of it so you just can't use it. I purchased two pumps from Ulta for very cheap and I use those instead of dealing with the pumps on these.You might be tempted to use a LOT of the conditioner if you're used to traditional conditioners that have silicone products in them. These don't have silicone (better for your curls!) so they won't give you that ""greasy"" sort of feeling that you'd otherwise get. We've been conditioned (no pun intended) to equate that greasy feeling with the conditioner ""nourishing"" your hair...but that's not what it's doing (at least not because of that greasy feeling). One Condition doesn't have silicone in it so it doesn't build up on your scalp. Cover your hair in it and you're good to go, adding more will not get you the greasy feeling you're used to. You'll readjust to how a conditioner SHOULD feel on your curls soon enough, don't worry :)For after the shower, squeeze off excess water from your hair and wrap a cotton t-shirt around it (terrycloth = frizz) and squeeze your curls, trying to keep their shape together. I highly recommend spraying in Deva Curl's Set It Free, scrunching in their Styling Cream, and using a small bit of their Light Defining Gel to finish off your curls. Try not to touch them too much while your hair is drying!!! When dry, you'll want to scrunch them up to your scalp to kind of ""release"" the curls and maybe flip your head and shake them out to get some more volume going. The less you touch, the less frizz you'll have!

Love this product. Leaves my curls feeling hydrated and manageable. No more frizz. I use with the styling gel and I don’t feel the need to always throw my hair in a bun because it isn’t cooperating. It does have a strong scent, but I like it.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have curly hair and have had lots of frizz lately so I started on a search for a product line that would take away the frizz and leave me with well defined curls. This is it finally! After trying 4 other brands I found it! The No-poo can be weird if you have never used it. No suds so how can it clean? It works great! When I used to comb my hair following a wash I would get a small handful of hair in my comb - now just a tiny few! I woul absolutely recommend this product and already have to a fw curly haired girlfriends!

"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I was visiting some friends overnight and used this in the shower. It was astoundingly good for my very long straight  thinning hair. It made it thick and lustrous and smooth. It just felt so good and looked so good. Shampoo and conditioner can do this? I thought it was all hype!  It's advertised for thick and curly hair (hmmm?). It's expensive and I have been strictly a cheapest shampoo in the aisle shopper for years, but I bought this stuff because it was remarkable for three days after washing.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I used to love deva curl products, but suddenly when I started these new bottles my scalp became itchy and sore, and I started losing a lot more hair than normal. I looked up the company to see if ingredients had changed, and I found that many other people are having the same issues after the company changed hands. I hate that I wasted so much money on something that ruined my hair.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
It arrived damaged. The cleanser exploded all over and I lost some of the product. I was still able to use it though, and boy does this make a world of difference for my curls. I won’t use anything else, I’ve tried everything!
"

I used to love this set. In the bringing my hair shiny soft and full of bounce. After 2 years my hair is thinning. I lose big piles of hair every time I shower. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! OVER TIME IT WILL DESTROY YOUR CURLS!!!
"

Absolutely love it !!  And don't forget the detangler ...and gel.  I've been using Deva products for about a year.  I've tried for years (decades) to get these kind of curls !!  AND when I don't want to wash my hair ... just a little water and a comb (or detangler) and you are ready for the day!Really love the compliments I get !!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love the product but after the last conditioner pump wouldn't expand/open/pump - I waited a year to buy it again. I figured the defect would be fixed by now. Nope. Conditioner bottle still doesn't pump - so I have to pull the pump out and pour conditioner on my hand to use. The bottle is heavy so it's not easy - and water gets in and dilutes the conditioner.will wait another year to buy again. Maybe then.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This is the best dia I have ever tried in my hair. I have been using it for two years now and these big bottles last for about ten months. I have long hair but only wash it every three days. It’s with the price!! I buy it once a year and my hair is always soft, shiny and healthy.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This was not good quality Deva Curl product.  I don't know what happened but it is cream color instead of white and came out of the bottle thick.  I have used this shampoo and conditioner for -0 years and I've never seen anything like this.I wish I used this sooner so I could return it.  $50 down the drain!

My husband has very coarse thick curly hair and he wears it shoulder length (usually tied up). He's very low maintenance and he doesn't have the patience to use a lot of products. This is why deva products are great. His hair is healthy, soft and moisturized all with just the shampoo conditioner and cream gel.

Since I started using this product along with other DevaCurl products my hair began to thin out. I originally attributed it to stress from work but for the last couple of months my hair has been falling out almost in clumps. I’ve immediately started using all devacurl products and now the hair loss is not as severe. I now have to find a way to restore my once beautiful head of curls.

I've been using the Deva Curl LOW Poo Original shampoo.  This product- NO POO Original shampoo has a different scent, consistency and smells chemically.  My mistake, but totally different scent, consistency than the LOW Poo Original.Still on the fence about moisturizing and softness
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
If you have curly hair, you will love this! It goes on like a conditioner or cream rinse  because it doesn't get sudsy. And as soon as you rinse it you will feel the difference! It takes a little getting used to but once you do you won't want anything else! As for the conditioner it's okay I usually use Pantene but decided to give this a try . Probably won't buy it again but I will continue to buy the no poo shampoo forever...
"

Deva curl isn’t the same. I noticed it does not wash off the hair products I used in the morning for example the mousse and hairspray. My hair feels hard and stiff. My brush gets stuck in my hair. I loved deva curl when the bottles were $30 but now that the price went up I feel like we are getting jipped. Disappointed. The conditioner isn’t the same. Poor quality.

I absolutely LOVE these products. I had been trying out different sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners since September 2011. I am happy to say these products are now my staple products for cleansing and conditioning my naturally curly hair (curl pattern 3b). Here's why:- they contain healthy ingredients for my naturally curly hair (type 3b),- they smell very refreshing like rosemary or peppermint,- the conditioner has enough slip to easily finger-detangle my curly hair,- the conditioner can be used as a leave-in conditioner,- the conditioner can be used for co-washing,- they cleanse and condition my hair very well,- they are part of the CG (curly girl) method,- they leave my hair clean and well moisturized, and lastly,- they do exactly what they're intended to do!If you are new to being natural, you should definitely try these products as they cater to curly and natural hair types. They are worth the money! Of course, you are going to go through your conditioner faster than your cleanser. I would also recommend using a leave-in conditioner.*For more information, visit my YouTube channel: Dpayne8 [...]

I bought this from my so's prime account in anticipation of using this sooner. I was fully expecting to have moisturized, defined hair when I got this product in the mail. I don't know if this is a different product repackaged as Devacurl, but it dried out my hair horribly!! It feels like straw and I am extremely disappointed. All this money for a horrible product.

I spent my entire life hating my hair. It was big. frizzy. untameable. I constantly had the 'lampshade effect' (flat on top, blown out at the bottom, you fellow curly girls will know what I mean). I have long corkscrew curly hair and I was never satisfied with it. It turns out, that was because I didn't know anything about it.All that changed when I read the Curly Girl book. I started to understand my hair, what makes it different from straight hair and what I'd been doing wrong all my life that made my hair such an unmanageable, unattractive mess. Once I read the book, and understood my hair (and all the ways that it's different from straight hair) I started to love it. So when I found Deva Curl and saw that it's made by the same people who wrote the Curly Girl book, I knew I had to have it.I'll never go back to another product. Immediatly, the very first time, I felt a difference in the texture and softness of my hair. I love the citrusy-mint smell. I love the clean tingly feeliing and most of all, I love how shiny, healthy and bouncy my hair is. Read the book, buy this product. You'll never go back to hating your hair again.

Love this. Weird no suds, but my curly hair is softer and more manageable than it has ever been. Will not go back to suds again. Also I do not use the nopoo every time,just the conditioner. If your hair is curly or dry and damaged try this product. Also very gentle color treated hair. My color lasts a  week longer and the color does not fade with this product. :)

My hair is falling out. I’m shedding a lot. I lose a fist full of hair in every washing and I find strands on my clothes during the day. This is not how my hair was before. It started out lustrous and bouncy but now it’s thin and straggly. There’s a big controversy right now about DevaCurl products. I don’t feel safe using them anymore.

I absolutely love the way my hair looks with the DevaCurl Products.

I began useing this product under the recommendation of my stylist. My first purchase was at her salon, but i began doubting I could afford such prices that were displayed at the establishment. So i searched Amazon, and found this deal.At my salon, one No-Poo and one One-Condition costs $41, both bottles are 12 oz. Here, same products in 32 oz bottles.I'll tell you right now, i'd rather pay $16 more than $66! Plus, i finally have a product that won't make a mess of my curly hair!

I have very dry, curly hair. I've tried everything! I started using this product last week and I love it!! I used to have to use at least three products ie leave in, mousse, serum, etc just to get a semi decent look with frizz control. No all I use is the No Poo cleanser, conditioner and gel. My curls are soft and frizz free. I also bought their towel and clips. Wonderful product, will definitely be buying again! Highly recommend!!

This product is not a true Deva curl product in my opinion. My hair is frizzy and weighed down since I started using this product. I have never dealt with this problem when buying the Deva curl from Ulta or an actual salon. And when I received it half of the conditioner had leaked out all over the packaging. Very disappointed.
"

My entire family loves this product. And the price is far better than purchasing it in a salon. In a salon each bottle is $40, we bought these two for $58 and didn't have to pay sales tax or shipping since we have Prime. That's a great deal!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Great no-sulfate and silicone free products. My husband has thick, straight, course, porous hair and this is the only shampoo/conditioner we've ever found that makes his hair behave itself. ""Conventional"" shampoos make his hair look like straw and stand on end. We originally bought it for me, (I have baby fine, thick, wavy/curly, non-porous hair) but it's too heavy for regular use. I use Acure Organics Moroccan Argan Oil + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo & Conditioner.
"

This came quickly! It was great. I am not a huge fan of the smell of the conditioner (personally, others might!). I may use the regular Deva Curl conditioner next time. however the product works really well. I have really curly hair and have such a hard time finding a conditioner that hydrates well and will detangle-- this works!

"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have a mixture of curly and wavy hair (3a and 2c for the nerds who know). I've been using DevaCurl NoPoo and One Condition for about three months, now, and it has increased the definition, spring and shine of my curls, converting a lot of what used to just be waves to curls. Drying method is super important though -- make sure you hang upside down and scrunch a lot of the water out, then dry with an old t-shirt to maximize your results. I finish with a mixture of B&B Curl Conscious Curl Calming Creme and a little bit of DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel.
"

It's been a little difficult getting use to the ""no poo"" I like a good lather and before this product I used ""lo poo"" and after a couple of weeks using this one I've decided that when its time to buy Deva Care shampoo again I'll go back to lo poo, hands down so much better for me. Great product though!

While nore expensive than other products, I believe worth it! These products have kept my hair in good shape despite regular highlighting and color. They also promote the natural waviness and curl of my hair. I won’t use anything else.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Works well to hold color longer. It takes some getting use to - not having foaming, soapy shampoo, but if you can handle that, this is super gentle on your hair and my fine hair is never weighed down by it. The only thing this is missing, is that I don't feel like it does anything for scalp health. I think it might be worthwhile to use something else a few days a week for that.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
The product (conditioner) smells drastically different than what I've purchased at a salon or Ulta, almost like lime or men's aftershave.  It has also caused skin breakouts on my forehead that I've never experienced.  When I told the seller about this they literally said, ""hope next time you have a better buying experience.""  It won't be thru them, for sure.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Nothing has worked better on my hair. I'm usually in a rush out the door, so an extensive list of hair products is something I would love to avoid. Thankfully, I only use the no poo and one condition. Also, these products do not irritate the scalp whatsoever or leave residue in your hair, so it remains soft yet voluminous all day. I'm waiting for summer when it gets quite humid in San Antonio to see how it holds up, but the odds are that it will. Lastly, I'm saving hella dollars on this than buying any form of drugstore conditioner that my hair will eat up instantly.

Product seems different from the one I purchased from the beauty  supply. Quality is not good
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This might be the best hair-care product I've ever bought just because of price alone. Yeah, it's around 60 bucks but I've been using this stuff for 6 months and the bottle is only half empty. I can get a full year out of these. You could be paying approximately 5 bucks a month for shampoo and conditioner that works so much better than the other brands. You pay probably $10 a month for the regular stuff. This will save you so much money if you use these bottles sparingly (I wash my hair every other day).As far as how well these products work, I am always pleased. My scalp tends to get dry and flakey but my stylist told me to always rinse the conditioner off of my scalp and add some conditioner to the tips of my hair to keep the moisture where it's needed. I feel like how I feel when I come out of the salon every time I wash my hair.This is a must buy.

Great product for my daughter who has extremely thick curly hair.  Don't use too much product as a leave in condition  as it will feel sticky and pasty!  If you use the leave in conditioner make sure the hair is wet and only use a little bit. At least that's my opinion with my daughter's hair! Great product though!

**UPDATE** I really wanted to love this product because I loved the way my hair felt after washing it and I LOVED the smell of all the products BUT!...I lost SO MUCH HAIR using this product.  If you read my review below where I state the loss of my hair, well it continued.  I stopped using the product made my own shampoo using Coconut Milk Cream and a few other oils and tiny bit of baking soda and used Apple Cider Vinegar as my conditioner and a few months later, my hair is slowly growing back and getting longer.I showed my girlfriend at work my hair one morning after washing it and she couldn't believe how much hair I'd lost, she apologized over and over because she introduce it to me but I explained it was not her fault, there may be something in there that just does not agree with my system and makes my hair fall out by the clumps.  Anyway, by accident I came across their salon in my city and met a stylist that asked me to have them look at my hair and allow them to do my hair.  I appreciate the offer but, there is no way, I'm letting this product touch my hair that is slowly growing back.  It doesn't seem to affect my friend and it may not affect yours either but if you start to see a lot of your hair fall-out, stop using it immediately.**Original Review**I originally purchased the travel set and loved the smell and feel of my hair after shampooing and conditioning it.  Also, because you only wash your hair once or twice a week with this product, the travel set lasted me nearly a month and gave me an opportunity to try the No-Poo, Conditioner, Light Defining Gel and Set it Free.Pros:-Paraben, Silicone and Sulfate Free-Love the smell of the product line, fresh hair smell-Compliments on my hair-Specifically designed for curly to wavy hair (mine has both)- The way my hair feels after shampooing, not dry or stripped-The size of the 2 Liter Duo and that Pump they come with-The fact that my hair and scalp still smell good between washesCons:-Glycerin, it doesn't state that it is plant-based so I have to assume it is animal Glycerin-The Cost, pretty expensive-The amount of hair I lose when I wash it (wash it once to twice a week)I've actually had someone say that they could smell my hair when I walked into their office and it smelled really good (same person that turned me on to this product, they have curly hair too). Thanks D! :)However, I'm still trying to get used to not washing my hair every other day; 5 days is the longest I've gone and could not believe my hair and scalp still smelled nice!However, I am now back to washing it every 3-4 days because any longer, the amount of hair I see loosing in the shower terrifies me but I believe it's because I am not combing it the days I don't wash it.  I just spray a little more water and the finishing setter that smells good and scrunch it more to set my curls again.I ordered the gel again and waiting for it to arrive.  I will continue using this until I come close to running out before I make my final decision about making this a permanent part of my routine. :)

I felt that I had to use a lot of the shampoo to get my hair to feel clean, keep that in mind if you are used to shampoos that lather, really liked the conditioner though, both have a pleasant smell!
"

I absolutely ADORE these products. My hair used to be extremely frizzy and unmanageable. I've also died my hair a billion times so it's very damaged. This shampoo and conditioner makes it possible for me to wear my hair curly and it actually look good! I love love love it!

Bought for my curly haired daughter. She is embracing her curls and is in love with DevaCurl products.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Love how creamy DevaCare products are! The DevaCare cleanser and conditioner are so creamy however that I can't dispense the product via the white caps. I always have to unscrew the cap to squeeze out product. This product also has a stronger scent than the DevaCurl products which is a nice fruity scent. My hair color didn't fade as bad with the DevaCare vs DevaCurl product.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Really didn't think the poo and conditioner were necessary.  But they are for me  It really makes a difference in my hair.  I have used wen and sally's one for a while.  This is better for my type hair.  My natural curly hair is graying and chemically colored.  Fine in texture, porous and I have a lot of hair.  If I look at rain it frizzes.

Best for curls without frizz!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
My sister turned me on to DevaCurl products ~3 years ago and I have been using them ever since.  I did have to get used to not having the lather effect when washing my hair as well as not feeling that it was ""squeaky clean"" but no worries. With DevaCurl products, my hair stays clean longer and the curls are more pronounced (which means the frizz has diminished significantly).  I buy the larger sized containers and tend to combine the products as it is more economical to do that.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I was hoping for good things with this cleanser and conditioner but I am extremely disappointed. It has made my hair very dry and it was a total waste of my money. Now I have to spend more money on another shampoo and conditioner. Do not buy this product if you are hoping for a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Was really looking forward to this but the item came broken and the conditioner was spilled everywhere. I like this product but was super disappointed that this happened I can’t even close the top of it all the way so it will keep on spilling. This is pretty expensive so I save for this to help my hair. Be aware of this there has been reviews similar to this before.

Makes my curls razzle dazzle!!  Fairly non-toxic according to the Environmental Working Group's beauty and cosmetic's buying guide.  I can't wash my hair with anything else.  I actually don't think I can live without DevaCurl.  I'm a DevaGuy.  =)

I try to aoid lathering products because I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out or break out. Same goes for my hair and scalp. My hair always feels very clean and dries much smoother with these products that even sulphate free lathering formulas. It's been about a year and a half and I am still hooked. I like the Deva Care just as much as Deva Curl- maybe more, as it seems more hydrating.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have been hooked on DevaCurl for years. It might seem weird to not ""shampoo"" your hair, since this product does  not produce suds, but I swear, your hair will be clean, and your curls will be awesome.One note- you really should not brush/comb curly hair after you get out of the shower. I had a hard time getting this through my head. Then, I started combing my hair while the conditioner was still on my hair in the shower. Then I rinsed it out and did not comb my hair when I got out of the shower. If you do this, your hair will curl much nicer as it dries. Trust me. Don't comb it after you shower. AND don't wrap your hair in a towel. Just squeeze it out really well, and wrap a towel around your shoulder if your hair keeps dripping. Again, your hair will curl better, with much less frizz.Try it....I hope it works for you, too!

My hair is like... completely new hair since I've started using DevaCurl products! My curly hair used to be brittle and frizzy, and I used to HATE wearing it down because I was so embarrassed of how poofy my hair would be. I now use Deva No Poo and One Condition in the shower, and then put a quarter-sized dollop of the Coconut Deva Cream in my palm after I get out of the shower and apply that to my wet hair, and my hair always comes out SO NICELY!! It has such a nice shine and bounce to it :)You can also add more of the coconut Deva cream to dry hair if your hair is still frizzy after it dries.Long story short, Deva Curl has changed my life! I no longer hate wearing my hair down and no longer use my hair straightener to get rid of my curls :)

I love this product but watch the shipping from this supplier. The shampoo had leaked everywhere. Lid was not tight and they were not taped closed. I would have returned it if I wasn’t totally out. Now I only have 3/4 of a bottle of the shampoo.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This is the best smelling shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. The smell is great and it keeps your hair smelling great for several days after washing. I use it whether I am going to go curly or straight because it is just great for gentle cleaning and helping reduce the frizzies.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
The shampoo has a slightly minty smell that I like. It doesn't foam and I'm surprised that I don't miss the foam. I know it's missing all those nasty chemicals that would damage my color-treated hair. It gets my hair clean and leaves it silky even without the conditioner. But I use the conditioner every time I shampoo and it makes my hair manageable and shiny. Great duo.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Thank you for the fast shipping. Exactly what I needed and delivered quickly. This is a ""couldn't live without"" product, always makes my curls soft and manageable. Will buy over and over.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Shampoo doesn't smell that great, but conditioner does. I bleach my hair regularly and I have had many compliments on how healthy and moisturized my hair looks since switching to this shampoo. I haven't noticed a huge difference in my curls though.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
The products arrived and I'll use both, but the bottle of Deva Curl No Poo is actually a mis-labeled bottle of Deva Curl One Condition, so you're actually getting two bottles of One condition. Having used Deva Curl products for years, I know that No Poo has a different smell, color, and consistency than One Condition. The factory where the products were labeled must have produced a substantial amount incorrectly as I've found the same issue at a few beauty supply stores that carry the products as well.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Works great! Tons leaked out in delivery and I messaged amazon and deva curl and never got any $ back.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love devacurl and feel it has made my hair much healthier, but when I received the product, I realized most of the product had spilled from the cap into the plastic package it was wrapped in. I usually don't complain when things like that happen because I understand that these things happen during delivery, but because of how expensive the product is I was rather disappointed. Perhaps instead of packaging the shampoo and conditioner with the pumps in place, they could use regular caps and just include the pumps, that could maybe help it from not spilling out. I will definitely buy this product again, just from a different seller.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I've had my first super curly, pixie cut--sort of like Halle Berry or Toni Braxton  =) since Dec.2014.  This product is easy to use, wonderful scent, best deal is on Amazon.  I payed more at the salon for the 8oz. bottles just to try it out; haven't been disappointed yet.  The hair gel is magical too!  Amazon had the best price for the32oz hair gel also.

The cleanser bottle top was broken.  Only about 1/2 cup was lost.  Decided not to send back.  I love the product.  I am white with long somewhat curly hair.  I color my hair.  This is the only product that does not make my hair feel dry after washing.  Thank you.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
My curly hair has never been prettier. I'll never use another shampoo.  I went on a work trip and decided to not bring the bottles because I didn't have room. There was a visible difference when I didn't use this shampoo.  I couldn't wait to come home !
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Great products.  I started using the DevaCurl products including the shampoo and conditioner, then had a hair appointment/consultation at a salon with a DevaCurl trained stylist and get much better results now with the instruction I received from the stylist than I had prior.  I'd strongly recommend seeing a DevaCurl trained stylist if possible in your area as the use of the products is very different than what I had been doing for my curly hair previously.  The DevaCurl book might be enough if you can't see a stylist locally, but the way they recommend using the products is completely different than how I'd ever styled my hair before.  You shampoo (takes a while to get used to no lather), then apply much more conditioner than I ever had before, barely rinse the conditioner out with cold water (to keep the cuticle of the hair closed), and then apply the styling products with your hair still dripping wet before ""scrunching"" with a microfiber towel or t-shirt fabric.  Also new to this styling regimen, I don't ever brush my hair anymore, and it somehow looks nice with smooth curls and isn't full of dreadlocks.  Anyway - very happy with these products and other DevaCurl styling products I've tried and won't be going back to my old routine anytime soon.

This stuff is amazing.  My curls were popping!! The product arrived right on time, and it was cheaper through amazon.  I purchased it at a department store for almost the same price but it was only 12 fl oz bottles and here I got 32 FL oz.  It has lasted me so much longer. I would recommend buying it.  I know I am!☺️

This product seems to have a different formula than the ones I've received before. The texture and smell are different and the product does not work well with detangling my hair.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have never use this product before and I heard amazing things about it, so I decided to give it a try. However, I am not sure if it is because it may be fake or is just the product but I haven't noticed anything amazing on my hair. The smell is not that strong and my scalp gets itchy.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I'm just now reading the reviews (after I purchased and used the product.) I have heard so many amazing things about DevaCurl so I decided to give it a try.  I read an article about drugstore products and products online not being the ""true"" product because they often times add alcohol to the product to dilute it.  I used this product and ever since, I have a spot on the back of my head that is severely dry and I cannot get it to go away.  I am very disappointed. I see a lot of other customers had product missing and faithful DevaCurl customers do not believe it is the same after they have used it.

I have curly hair naturally, which I've spent most of my life straightening because I hate it.  I've tried to go no-poo before and embrace the curls.  I've tried other brands of no-poo, brands of no sulfates but that still lathered.  I've tried very hard to embrace my curls with no luck.  I've resisted buying Deva Curl because it's just so darn expensive.  I finally broke down and ordered it and committed to really giving it the good old college try.  I've been using it now for a few weeks and I think I've finally found what I need to like my curls.  The frizziness is gone.  I also have kind of half curly, half wavy hair that always just looks like I slept on it.  These products have improved the condition of my hair to such an extent that it's curling more, and actually looks like something someone might do to their hair on purpose.  Letting my curls be is *so much less work* than blowing it out and straightening, and I'm thrilled to finally have found something that will work for me.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Love this product but got two bottles of No-Poo when I ordered one & one conditioner. Didn't notice until after I started using one bottle so it was too late to exchange it.  Double check.  I have ordered this set for years & this is the first time it has happened.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This product works really well, especially if you follow the advice of your Devachan stylist. Smells great, keeps curls bouncy, and will improve hair over time! For best results with this product, you'll have to stop using products with silicones and sulfates.

"

Seemed to be the real deal, and very gentle on hair. Deva conditioners don't have a lot of slip imo, but love the smell and that they don't leave my hair weighted down, even though I do use a little as a leave-in at the end. No poo is no lather, but seems to be just what my scalp wants.

I originally purhcased my DevaCurl products straight from the salon that cuts my hair. I ordered these when I ran out as they were such a good deal. This seller sent me the old formulation of the One Condition, which contains silicones, and all that other crap, and is a much thinner consistency, and has a terrible reeking perfume smell. My hair doesn't behave like it did when I used the legit deva one condition I got from my salon. The no-poo and arc angel is the same though. Wish I could just return the one conditon or get the recent formula sent :(
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Every curly girl should be a Deva Curl girl. I have 3B curls and switched over to Deva Curl about 9 months ago and I have never regretted it. The No Poo shampoo is perfect for the cold/dry weather months in MI and keeps my hair clean but moisturized. The One Condition conditioner is great and I don't need to use as much as I used to with other products since the No Poo shampoo is so moisturizing. In the summer months I switch to the Lo Poo shampoo - still moisturizing but with MI humidity I need something that cleanses but doesn't add as much moisture to my hair as the No Poo. For my daily routine I combine Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner with Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner and then Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel. My hair stays soft and my curls stay perfectly corkscrewed. I wasn't a big fan of Deva Curl's B'Leave In Curl Boost and Volumizer only because it caused me to have white dusty stuff flake off of my hair. Otherwise it held my curls well and made my hair soft, but the white dusty stuff was annoying. If you are a curly girl at your wits end with all of the terrible products out there that do nothing for curly hair, I suggest trying Deva Curl. Get the trial sizes first so you can figure out what works best for your type of hair. As long as there is Deva Curl on the market, I don't think I'll ever use any other products (except for my Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner because that stuff is also great)!

"

This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner for my dry curly hair. The NoPoo is designed to clean dirt but not remove oil, so it keeps hair from drying out, meaning less frizz and more curl. At first, my hair got greasy using it, but it soon djusted and stopped making excess oil because I stopped stripping it of its natural oil. The conditioner is great too.

I love these two products - both the 'non-sudsing' no sulfate good for your hair shampoo and the wonderful conditioner.  My daughter's and I have curly hair, and mine is also dry.  These products leave our hair bouncy, shiny and revitalized.  Thoughtful botanical extracts and no animal testing make it a conscientious product as well.  Love the smell and the DevaCurl concept of not stripping the hair of natural oils needed for healthy locks.....

NEVER GOING BACK TO ANYTHING ELSE! This is THE ultimate product for curly girls/guys. It's so gentle I even use it on my baby. For years I wore my hair curly but this product is the first to actually heal my broken hair and restore it to what it always should have been. Adds the perfect amount of moisture without making my hair greasy. Cleans your scalp without drying it out. I recommend this product to EVERYONE, even people with straight hair. It's wonderful!!!!

There are three other curly heads in the house all with different hair strand thickness and degrees of curliness...product works great an all types.  No oily build up and hair looks amazing.  Smells amazing too!!  For fine hair this product goes a long way, so glad I tried it.

The scent is very natural but since it's the strongest essential oil smell. I can see how some people thought it smelt like a chemical. But it smells so nice to me.

Makes my hair feel broken and brittle

Damaged hair. Has a horrible smell.

DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I've been using deva curl for over a year now and i absolutely love their products! the no-poo and one condition smell awesome, made my curls nicer, and made my hair soft. Even when i bleached my hair it only took 2-3 weeks to get healthy again. Also on the up side for me is their products are vegan friendly ^^I would recommend this to anyone with curly hair, and i'm sure people with straight hair could even use it!

The products seemed authentic, however the pump on the conditioner bottle was nonfunctional so I had to substitute the one from a bottle of ultra defining gel which got messy. Basically, don't throw away functioning pumps when buying these from amazon.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Totally different scent--this is NOT the actual product.  Imposter!  Do not buy this, pay close attention to the label verses the actual product sold in salons.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
My only complaint is that it should have some type of padding around the bottles. When you open the package the product is all over the bottles.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
What I received was a counterfeit product. I compared with the deva curl I purchased at a licensed retailer and this smells and looks different.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I can finally embrace my curly hair! My curls are defined and shiny without being frizzy, crunchy, or weighed down. I'm so happy! I also recommend the styling cream.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I really like DevaCurl no poo and one condition. I have been using Wen for the last 6-10 months and I loved it. But I have noticed that I have a lot of hair coming out in the shower and I feel that my hair is thinning. So I decided to try something else out for a while to see if my concerns are real. Deva Curl is the next best thing. The no poo is gentle on my hair and leaves my hair feeling clean and the one condition leaves it soft and make it easy to finger-comb my hair and get the tangles out before i get out the shower. I love it. And it is much cheaper than the Wen even with having to buy two bottles instead of one. DevaCurl may make me a convert from Wen. The only gripe I have is that it could smell better. I am not in love with the smell but it doesn't stink it just doesn't smell good to me. I definitely recommend trying it out. If you want to try it without the risk you can buy it from Sephora. They take returns of used items up to 60 days after. I always buy new items from them that way if I don't like it I can return it for a refund. Then if I like it I usually end up ordering it from Amazon after that.

it appears that women with curl have more bad hair days, however, I discovered the DivaCurl website and decided to take a chance on trying something different again. I know that I personally have tried every solution to try and make my hair straight. Today, I now embrace my natural curl and have found all Deva hair products to work very well if you go with your natural curl - never to use harsh products or curl/flat irons again.I would highly recommend this product to others that want to show off their natural curls. However, read her book or visit a registered salon before you expect miracles...

DevaCurl works great on my curly hair. It keeps it soft and moisturized and smells wonderful.
"

Great product! The only one that works on my daughter’s curly hair. Well worth the money!
"

Salon size is worth it. I love this product. The conditioner lasted  me about 9 months and the nopoo about 1.5 years

Bottle came with sharpie marks, spilled, wrapped in weird plastic that I've never seen this product come in. Didn't smell right.

These products have made all the difference for my bi-racial daughter and her super curly hair.  It controls frizz and makes her curls defined and bouncy. Her hair is softer and healthier since switching to this brand.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
If you have curly hair you cannot live without DevaCurl. These products keep your curls bouncy and Frizz-Free. Most other items on the market leave curls feeling dry, heavy and full of product while DevaCurl moisturizes and hides split ends and frizz. Being a Curly Girl I couldn't live with out.I hope this helps you make an important decision!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"

Amazing for people with curly hair. Turned my hair from being really dull into hair that has life
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Love this product line.  Am always surprised at how clean my hair feels and the great texture my curls have when using this. Unfortunately it does have a drying affect not in my hair but on my scalp so I don't use in winter. Also wish they would offer a creamier conditioner and a different scent. Not fond of the lemon lime.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Item description says 32 oz shampoo and 32 oz conditioner. I received a 12 oz shampoo and 12 oz conditioner. Reading through some of the other reviews I see that i am not the only one who has had this issue
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
DevaCurl changed my life. Then I found DevaCare, and took it to another level. If you used DevaCurl before, the DevaCare is a richer product with a citrus scent. I never liked the herbal Devacurl scent, so this is an improvement in my book. It smells just like regular shampoo without making my hair feel like a rat's nest. The No Poo provides excellent slip for detangling. I highly recommend a Wet Brush, which you can buy here on Amazon, for detangling. It makes a world of difference, cutting your shower time in half (if you have as much hair as me!). For reference, I am a 2b/2c curly with baby fine strands and very low porosity (I have not dyed my hair in over five years). I recommend the DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel with Queen Helene Royal Curl Cream and Eden All Natural Curl Defining Creme, as well as a little melted coconut oil to seal your ends.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I've been using this product on my bi-racial daughters very curly hair for 2 years.  It never dries her hair out and keeps it healthy and shiny.  I have wavy hair and also us this along with they Angel to keep the curls defined all day. I would recommend DevaCurl products to anyone looking for hair care for curly heads.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have ordered this same product multiple times from this vendor yet each time the product is slightly different. This time the conditioner is so thick it barely comes out of the pump. It almost like a paste.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
quality and good price
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
The product is amazing I know the product! But the packaging is sub par.  There was conditioner and shampoo everywhere when i opened it. And a set of this is 60 freaking dollars. Ridiculous
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
The DevaCurl system is great! I had pretty much given up on my naturally curly hair ever looking good again. It was dry and limp, but DevaCurl works wonders. The DevaCurl process took some getting used to at first (as did the price!), but I honestly believe it's worth it. I've never been willing to spend much on beauty products of any kind, but this system really does work for me, and I will be sticking with it!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Love this shampoo and conditioner, plus it is so much cheaper here than the actual store
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love DevaCurl products.  However, the packaging needs to be better managed.  Both my shampoo and conditioner spilled in the plastic.  Not only did I lose product, but I had to spend time cleaning up the mess.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I made the mistake of ordering deva care. I have only purchased deva curl in the past. When I received it in the mail I thought it was a rip off and was not the product I ordered or remembered buying before...my mistake. I like deva curl alot better. I like the lemongrass smell and the condition has more slippage.  Deva curl does what you need it too but I don't like the smell...it reminds me of orange cream with peppermint maybe. So beware before you buy know that there is a difference between deva curl and deva care.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I've used Lo-Poo w/ B'Leave-in conditioner and they left my hair with much body. These 2 products leave my hair so soft that the curl disappears. What the deal???

"

Great for curly and fine hair because it doesn't weight it down and keeps it from getting dry. Gentle and effective.
"

I have very thick, course curly hair .. and I am trying to learn to enjoy it .. and not straighten it all the time .. Some one told me about these Deva Curl Products and I am amazed at how well they work .. My hair is soft, full of moisture and the curls are so much prettier and more manageable .. I am very happy to have found both of these.. though I hear some people just use the conditioner very successfully .. Note: You do have to get used to shampooing your hair without any suds .. but now I love moving the cream through my hair .. and it cured my dry scalp as well . Yeah. Great product ..
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
this stuff works really well, love the smell of the One conditioner, we actually pit it in a spray bottle mixed with water as a spray leave in, works great when you just want to revive your curls with out washing your hair..

I’ve been using this shampoo for years! Smells great and works even better
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Nice orange smell. Makes curly hair nice and hydrated. Shampoo will only make a little bit of suds if you add a little water to your hands. Rinse it well and it will be good. Only complaint is that it's so thick it's hard for me to grip that giant bottle and squeeze easily.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
My daughter has very thick curly hair and loves these products. They work very well for her, and help reduce frizziness.

My naturally curly hair has never looked better. I will never go back to a traditional shampoo and conditioner.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love the Decatur Duo. The Nopoo cleans my hair well without drying it out and the conditioner adds moisture without weighing my hair down.  I have curly hair but it is not corse so it can be hard to find a good balance between mosturizing without weighing it down.  They both also smell amazing to me.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This shampoo and conditioner set is simply a game changer. When used together, it's a home-run folks. My hair stylist introduced me to this brand and I have been amazed ever since. This set truly does it all. I am so grateful. I no longer get dry scalp, dry knotted areas, or puffy frizz zones. My hair detangles with just my fingers in the shower (crazy) and it curls voluminously when air dried. I simply love this product..... PS I use this in conjunction with Devacurl's ultra defining gel.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"

Love the product so I bought the shampoo and the conditioner.  The price is the same as the store so I thought it would save me trip, but one of the pumps is defective and doesn't work. Conclusion: buy from the store next time so at least I can exchange if necessary. Not happy

Got this not realizing it had gluten.  I loved all the reviews on how natural it is.  Wheat is natural, just bad for my celiacs.  I only rated it a little lower because of reaction to the wheat.

I think this stuff smells horrible, my husband hates it too. And it does not make my curls bouncy and lovely, it makes them limp. I don't know what the draw of this stuff is supposed to be, but it didn't work for me.
"

"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have been using this product for about a month. The fact that it doesn't lather doesn't bother me because my hair feels just as clean after washing it out. It doesn't seem to dry out my hair either. As for the smell of the shampoo.. not great but not terrible either. Kind of reminded me of the smell that hits you when you walk into a salon (slightly). The conditioner does have a nice scent. I have wavy hair and it does seem to help maintain the waves longer. With other shampoos my hair would lose it's wave by the end of the day. I do still put a smoothing balm in my hair because it doesn't take the frizz completely away. A reviewer said to use silicon free products. So, in conclusion- my hair feels healthier (and I've colored it twice this year), my waves are more defined and stay longer but I had to get used to the shampoo smell and there's some frizz (only reasons it doesn't get 5 stars) I don't see myself switching shampoos any time soon!** update: I'm switching to 5 stars because I am (strangely) no longer bothered by the smell of shampoo. It doesn't bother me and I actually like it now. I've been using since November and I still love it. I now also use it in combination with deva curl light defining gel and love the combined effect.

I've tried so many different products for my curls and none of them have been as good as Deva products. Deva products give my curls softness and bounce. The conditioner makes my curls so much easier to style. The shampoo however doesn't quiet clean my hair,after a day my hair feels itchy. I use it in combination with other shampoos. I still use it because the shampoo also makes my hair softer and helps out my curls.
"

"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love what this shampoo does for my curls and scalp.  I have struggled with an itchy scalp for years and the dermatologist couldn't give me an explanation as to why or a solution.  I noticed 2 things immediately after starting this shampoo. First, my scalp no longer itches and second, less hair falls out when I wash it.  Not sure why, but my guess for both would be the harshness of the surfactants in other shampoos.  Also, now I have great curls even on top!  Used to be when I grew my hair out the curls on top would get straightened out by the weight of my hair.  Now they don't do that.  I also use their LIght Defining Gel daily and the cream when it's incredibly humid.  They give my Celtic curls a natural shine and volume.  I have never loved my hair more!For those who've never used a latherless shampoo, it does take some getting used to.  The first time I quit because I couldn't believe it could possibly be getting my hair and scalp clean.  I never thought about the fact that if my hair wasn't clean then my curls wouldn't be so defined all the way to the top!  I'm so glad I gave it a 2nd try and even more glad that I went to their website and chatted with one of their advisors to figure out which products were best for my hair.

"

My low rating has nothing to do with DevaCurl, I absolutely love their products.  However, based on the image and title for this product, I expected to receive the ORIGINAL DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition.  Instead, I received the discontinued line of DevaCare products.  Looking back on the item page, the only place I see ""DevaCare"" listed is in the ""About the Product"" section, despite the DevaCurl Original being shown in both the title and photo of the product. So, if anyone is planning on purchasing this product, please keep in mind that it will be DevaCurl's DEVACARE line, not the original products.On the other hand, anyone thinking of using any of DevaCurl's products, I strongly recommend them! They make my curly hair look and smell great!

My hair is a mixture of all curls. I've struggled to find a good moisturizing shampoo/conditioner. This has worked really well. Only problem I have is that I never know how clean my hair is when I use the no poo, since I'm used to the foam of regular shampoos. My hair is really shiny now and soft. This product has helped a ton with elasticity too!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have been a DevaCurl girl for years and have tried other products targeted for curly hair suggested by friends...but I always go back to DevaCurl (those friends are DevaCurl girls now too). Love the revamped difuser as well. As a user you have to find the correct protocol that works for you. I find that reapplying a bit of ""water downed"" conditioner works well as a leave-in conditioner in combination with the cream or light gel.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This Shampoo and Conditioner is amazing!! It really brings out the curls! The no-poo shampoo takes some getting used to, because it doesn't lather and foam up, but boy does it work! I highly recommend this product!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love this stuff! I asked my hairstylist sister-in-law what products to use on curly hair after being severely disappointed by another brand. She sent me the trial pack and I was so happy, I bought the full-size versions of the No-Poo Cleanser and the One Conditioner right away. The other products in the trial package are great too, but they last much longer. I am mixed-race and have curly hair (type 3B). This stuff works WONDERFULLY on my hair. I do not use any extra shampoo outside of the No-Poo cleaner. It doesn't lather, but it smells really good, it conditions, and I can see that it's cleansing after I rinse. The cleanser and the conditioner both offer good slip for combing your hair out. I suggest using your fingers or a wide-tooth comb while conditioner is on your hair if you have curly hair. Do not comb when it's dry! I apply the conditioner, and sometimes I rinse a little bit and sometimes I just leave it all in. My hair never feels heavy. It feels very light -- like there's nothing in there at all -- and my curls form awesomely! I've constantly had people at work asking me what did I do to my hair or what products I put in my hair because there is a big change in how healthy and nice it looks. I recommend letting your hair air dry and not messing with it. DevaCurl also has a non-sticky curl defining gel and a humidity spray that I use as well. If you have curly hair -- try this! I've tried other products and have been suuuuper disappointed. DevaCurl has been such a breath of fresh air.By the way, they have a very strong, fruity smell. Some people may not be into that. I like it!

While this duo did well on hair performance-wise.  The smell reminded me of rest areas.  Sorry, it did.  I moved onto Canty co-wash.

An awesome duo that I have been using for many years. They are gentle on hair, smell delightful, makes your hair nice, shiny, full of body, and clean without horrible chemicals.

The shampoo is great, low lather, and smells faintly of rosemary.  The conditioner seems very runny and not particularly moisturizing for my curls.  It also has a weird citrus bathroom cleaner smell.

This product is a must in a daily regimen for curly hair.  It helps maintaining curls and is good for your hair.  I'm glad it comes in a large quantity.  DevaCurl products are of good quality.

My hair loved this no-poo but my skin did not. I broke out in a bad rash on my neck from it and had to give it away. Now I'm back to frizzy hair while I wait for my neck to heal.

It was not the same product.  Product was a fake. Did not smell the same.  Different texture. Different packaging.  Different everything. A complete imitation. and a bad one at that.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Great deal on these products.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
The product you will receive is DevaCare and not what is in the picture or title of the posting (DevaCurl). I ordered the duo, but the quality of the product is awful compared to the DevaCurl products. The product is a thick disgusting consistency, has no scent, does not cleanse or condition as well, and did not come with a pump, and because of consistency does not pump even if you use your own pump. You will be disappointed if you're expecting the great DevaCurl quality.

DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
Love how it makes our hair look.... it really brings out the curls in my naturally wavy hair. It works even better on my boyfriend's hair! Lovely smell too-- people are always huffing my hair and complimenting me for the smell. Haha!The only downside is after a few months of using it we are both experiencing dandruff and dry/itchy scalp... when we stopped using this No-Poo it cleared up. I wish they would change the formula to something more gentle and moisturizing.Since then, we do still use this but to stop the dandruff need to do a scalp mask with coconut oil to keep our scalps from drying out.

Best curly hair product ever. I now have ringlets--and no frizz!
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I have been using DevaCurl products for quite some time now and they are great.  I have a mix of 3b and 3c hair type and they give me the necessary amount of moisture without weighting my hair down.  I'm against a long routine so this are great. I wash, condition and use the light gel; and my hair stay frizz free for at least 3 days.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I love it!  DevaCurl products are the BEST things I have ever used on my hair.  Finally, I can let my hair air dry without hating the results!  My curls last longer than ever, are bouncier than ever, feel soft, and smell great.  Unless my hair texture changes drastically, I'm never using another brand of shampoo or conditioner.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I'm already obsessed with this product. I'll never purchase anything else for my curly hair again.
"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
This product was such a disappointment. I am a huge fan of DevaCurl No-Poo, but this is not it. It's a light colored, yellow-ish formula that smells really different than the white, thick formula of the real No-Poo. These products dried my hair out and left it looking ashy, stringy, and frizzy. It made the ends of my hair look fried. I have never tried a DevaCurl conditioner before, but if it made my hair look this bad, I feel like it must be a faulty imitation product as other reviews have suggested. Don't waste your money on these!!!! Go buy the real thing from the website or directly from DevaCurl on Amazon.

I like that it seems to work with my thin curly hair. I can allow it to air dry and it'll look good, not dry and frizzy. I only wish the smell of it was different... It has a very strong chemical-y smell. Other than that not too bad.

Amazing products! I love Deva Curl and the way it smells. I've been using it for years now and it works amazing on my thin curly hair.

Product wasn't as helpful at taming my dry, frizzy curls as I had hoped.  That said, though, it does appear to work better than other products I've tried.  I have to leave a lot of conditioner in (ie not rinse as well) to get noticeable results.

This shampoo does everything it claims it does. Before using the product my curls were frizzy waves and I hated the way they looked without heat styling. After using this shampoo and conditioner combo my waves are closer to curls and look great even when I just let my hair air dry.

I LOVE the DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner, but was highly disappointed when both the bottles arrived having spilled in the packaging. It was a huge mess, and I lost a good deal of the product itself. Previously, I have bought the 12oz bottles from my hair salon. Ordering the bigger bottles online is more cost-effective, but I don't know if it's worth the clean-up or spilled hair products.

The product is fine but the pump on the shampoo doesn't work...at all. That's the second time that's happened with this product. It's ALOT of shampoo and a bit pricey to have a pump that doesn't work.

As I've aged, my hair has gotten very wavy and a bit frizzy.  I tried this product in a sample form and loved it so much that I now use it regularly.  Be warned, the shampoo is not a sudsy foaming shampoo since it has no sulfates.  It takes a bit of getting used to but it's well worth it.  My hair always feels clean, soft and shiny after using.  The conditioner is equally as great.  I use it as both a conditioner and leave-in.  Might be overkill but I condition my hair, as one normally would following the shampooing.  After rinsing and squeezing out excess water, I apply a very small amount to just the ends of my hair and then towel dry as usual.  I allow my hair to air dry naturally and it's soft and shiny with lots of body.  However, if I really want to ""pop"" my curls, I usually add a small amount of the Devacurl Light Defining Gel.

I love the DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition for my hair! I struggled for years jumping from one shampoo brand to another until I was introduced to these products and now I'm absolutely addicted to them because they leave my curls looking well hydrated and shaped!

I have 4a,b, and C hair. I really like what both of these do for my hair. The No-Poo gets my scalp clean and refreshed. And it leaves my hair clean without being dry. The conditioner is awesome. My hair loves it, my skin not so much. I've had to adjusted the way I use it so that it does not cause my skin to break out. But then again too much oil also causes me to break out. I also use their Styling cream. For all of their products, a lot really does go a long way. I cannot cut out my use of oil completely, my scalp still needs a little jojoba oil once a day, but for the most part, I don't need any other extra heavy creams or balms so much. I only break out the SM curling smoothie when I am doing a wet/set type of style. They are awesome, but you will have to try to find out.

The products came in a timely fashion, but one of the bottles came with a broken top. The top was supposed to be a pump top that you turn and the pump pops up, but when I turned the top, the top didn't pop up. It's inconvenient to use the bottle now as I have to open the top each time and product gets wasted.

"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
I absolutely love this product!! Im nineteen and I wish I would have found Devacurl sooner so I wouldn't have damaged my hair with all the heat I used to tame it when I was younger. I have had curly hair all of my life and have never been able to tame it...until now. It's a little weird getting used to the shampoo not lathering but after a few washes you get used to it. I just started using the conditioner and it works wonders also. It's strange because the ""no-poo"" has a conditioner-like texture and thickness, whereas the ""one condition"" is thinner and feels like watery sunscreen. But for how awesome this stuff works, I don't care what it feels like. My hair is soft, frizz free (even in high humidity), and my curls are beautiful. I can even take a shower and go out and let it air dry without having to worry about my hair getting big and crazy. It is pricy but completely worth it. I also use Argan oil and the coconut curl styler after I shower, let it air dry, and it literally looks like I curled my hair!

I have struggled with my curls my whole life. After a friend suggested DevaCurl, I ordered this combo and I will never go back. My hair is softer, more manageable and much less frizzy. I will say my fiance doesn't love the scent, but it doesn't smell bad. Its just not like the typical shampoos/conditions. Either way, I love this product!

"
DevaCurl DUO - One Condition 32oz + No-Poo 32oz,"
First of all, I LOVE DEVACURL. I have very dry, thick curly hair, and I find that Devacurl products are the only thing that can consistently make it soft and shiny and manageable. I am a college student, so expensive haircare products aren't usually prioritized in my budget, but I always make sure to save for my NoPoo and conditioner.On the products themselves: I find that NoPoo does a great job of cleansing my scalp, and doing so while keeping my hair soft. I rarely use traditional shampoo (once a month maybe? Or whenever I'm feeling particularly greasy) because this product works so well. One pump works for my whole head, and that's AWESOME! I could talk for HOURS about how much I love One Condition. One pump to a pump and half is enough for my nearly waist-length curly hair. This summer, I couldn't afford DevaCurl, and I needed 6-7 pumps of drugstore conditioner to get anywhere near the same conditioning effects. It's wonderful for my hair rinsed out, but when I need a little something extra I'll leave it in! So hydrating!! Sometimes I'll treat it like a hair mask, and saturate my hair in it for a few hours. There's nothing this stuff can't do!!!Now, for the reason behind my one star review. Today when I received my order, both bottles leaked a tremendous amount inside the bag they were sealed inside. Thank goodness the bottles were placed inside a bag! They were placed inside a box with two surge protector power strips that I ordered, and it would have been highly unpleasant to have had those ruined by hair products. I'm also disappointed because it seems like a significant amount of product was lost. Both bottles are slightly concave as if they were squeezed tightly and then closed, as well as noticeably less than full. I'm disappointed because it feels like I'm not really getting my money's worth, and I really love this stuff. I guess I'll just have to hope that I can find it in-store somewhere for next time.

I love, love, love this product. I didn't think I'd like a no-poo shampoo but I do & the conditioner is incredible. The smell is nice too. I don't like anything too strong or perfumey & this has a clean, fresh scent. My hair stylist always told me how dry my hair was & that was using RedKen. This has made my hair so soft & manageable. I have Caucasian, naturally curly, wavy, crazy, frizzy hair. It isn't really think but not thin either. Some parts are curlier & some straighter so my hair is a hot mess. Also I do color my hair ever 6 weeks. This really makes my hair feel healthy. Received this really quickly. I think it's a great price & I would def recommend the product & the seller. I bought just the conditioner from a different seller at a cheaper price & it was watered down. This is the real deal. You get what you pay for.

Overall I absolutely love these products. I never knew I could take this frizzy mop on my head until a friend turned me on to these two years ago. Since then I’ve always ordered this particular set of shampoo and conditioner without one problem. However, my last purchase in November left quite a lot to be desired. First, theproduct was all over inside the box. I excused that. Things happen in shipping. However, the smell of the conditioner was awful. Terrible. Unusable. It was in the more recent product packaging as the bottles changed in the last year or so. But really this conditioner was bad. I’ve ordered plenty of times without issue so I’m going to order again right now. It’s a risk but I hate to give up a tried ad true seller without a little forgiveness.I’ll update in the next few days to let you know what I receive.Again, these products are amazing and I actually feel good about my hair when I use them. It’s the one purchase that brings the review down.

I have ordered these products before from Amazon before without problems. But it was always one bottle at a time, not a duo. When I opened my package I noticed that the color of the shampoo and conditioner was different (not white like it should be)  and once I opened the bottle, I realized someone somewhere messed up because it is not the same smell. The bottles were ""taped shut"" with yellow paint tape, which should have been a big red flag.

After one use I saw a difference in my curls, and after about three uses I saw significant difference in my curls. They form in exactly the way they look when I use my wand on the top half of my hair (because it never used to dry curly) and all of my hair dries curly now! It is a little more expensive than most shampoos (compared to Pantene that I was using before) but it is SO worth it to not have to style my hair at all. My curls used to only really form in humid places like the beach, but every day my hair dries exactly as I would have styled it. I dry my hair with a t-shirt to prevent frizz in addition to using Deva Curl and I have perfect curls every day! Definitely worth the investment.

I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls. I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren't any better than their cheaper counterparts. Don't waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products. Head to Target for the same type of shampoo, Frizz-Free stuff, gel & condition without bruising your credit card. My opinion only, but I've found better products for my curly hair at Ross', TJ Max and Marshalls. Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz. It's cheap & it works.

I purchased this in September.  I had previously bought it at a hair salon and at ULTA.  This time it made my hair frizzy and dry.  I just figured that it didn't work for me anymore and started trying new products.  I tried it again today and suddenly realized that it didn't have any scent and neither did the shampoo.  I had a travel size kit that I had purchased at ULTA and never used, so I went and got it and smelled it.  Sure enough, it had that wonderful scent that the real Decadence has.  I smelled them side by side.  What a difference!  Next I compared the consistancy.  I put a little of the travel size product on my forefinger and moistened it under the faucet.  Some conditioner stayed on my finger.  I tried the same thing with the product that I purchased here and the conditioner all washed off!!  No wonder why my hair is so dry!!

Even though this product smells exactly like devacurl products, I believe it is not the real thing or maybe it is a mixture of devacurl and other fillers.

This product was a lot thicker and denser. However, i continued using it thinking that maybe I was imagining things. A week after using it, I noticed that my scalp had become very itchy, and this product leaves buildup unlike the real devacurl products. It also does not dissolve in water as I tried to put it in a spray bottle for refreshing my curls, and it did not dissolve at all.Moral of the story... don't be cheap, and pay for the real thing! #moneywasted

I’m of mixed race with super fine and frizzy tiny curls. I’m 50 years old and have been a product junky for most of my life, with mixed success. But I always wanted my hair to swing, and to hold it’s all-over curl, like it does when wet or freshly washed. I discovered DevaCurl 1 year ago by asking a black customer of mine what she used in her lovely curls. My hair is now perfect every day, even when I wake. When I get a haircut, I no longer need drastic damage cuts, and so my hair is the longest it’s been. The secret is to follow Deva Curls instruction book. 1. No other non-Deva products (this is non-silicone, non oil, so hydration can soak in). 2. Filter on shower head ($25 or so at home improvement stores, easy to self-install). 3. Use a satin pillowcase or head covering at night to stop friction (graceeleyae.com products recommended). 4. I only use 3 DevaCurl products. No-poo, Decadence Conditioner and Arc Gel. According to my hairdresser, I don’t need any of the deep conditioner. After washing and combing, re-wet hair, carefully squeeze out excess water, and soak strands thoroughly with conditioner, DevaCurl says until strands feel like seaweed. Use a microfiber towel or tee shirt to carefully squeeze out excess water. Put copious amounts of gel in. Hair will still be soft, nongreasy, and even comb-able (when wet), in future. 5. Wash hair as little as is necessary. I wash weekly. 6. For daily maintenance, I stand outside of shower, and moisten my hair in the running warm water. Re-squeeze with microfiber towel, finger comb if necessary and reapply more conditioner and gel. First time in my life that strangers stop me in the street daily to complement my hair! Products not cheap, but I’m no longer throwing away unworkable products or paying for Brazilian Blowouts, or relaxers, etc. I wasn’t paid in anyway for this recommendation.

I love this stuff! I've been using Deva Curl for almost 2 years now and I have not loved a conditioner as much as I love this one. If you're thinking of trying out Deva Curl, or if you haven't used Decadence yet, give it a try. This stuff is heaven! I've heard stories about people getting watered down bottles (and this actually happened to me with conditioner once - different seller) but I am completely pleased with this purchase. If the price is scaring you off, one of the large bottles lasts me over 6 months because I only need to use it once or twice a week. I have very thick and long hair that is, or rather was, very prone to getting greasy. Now that I'm using this product line it takes days for my hair to start looking and feeling like it needs a wash, After a few weeks of using Deva Curl I can honestly say that my hair has never been happier!

The perfect prescription for my overly dry curls. When used right this will make your curls silky smooth and soft. Leave most of it in your hair! Use a small amount of ultra defining gel, get the right deva cut. Totally life changing! Curls are awesome!!!This conditioner becomes heavy in the curls after they are hydrated or in humid climates... may want to start with a smaller bottle to make sure it is what you want.

Upgraded to decadence after using the original for years and I am amazed.  After the first use my curls improved ten fold to the point where people noticed. The scent is so much more pleasant my husband can't get enough of it!It's also light enough to be used as a leave in which can be a must in the dry cold winters a mile above sea level. If I need a boost and something thicker I will use Heaven In Hair from the original line.I'll never use anything else on a daily basis again. Can't go wrong with this one if your a Curly Girl!

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I've tried so many conditioning products for my wavy/curly hair and they either flatten the curl or leave my hair looking like a frizz ball. DevaCurl products have saved my hair. I use the decadence line, since it's more moisturizing to my color processed hair, but the no-poo and low-poo are great as well. If you're just switching over to non-sulphate shampoo and condition, it'll take a bit of getting used to the feel. Trust. It IS cleaning your hair, it IS rinsing out, and it's NOT going to leave an excess film (it's just the way it feels, and it leaves your curls protected and luscious). With regular use (and if you don't alternate with sulphate shampoos) you are going to see a major difference. I was never able to comb through my long, curly hair in the shower without a lot of stress, trying to get the conditioner through while working out all the tangles. With this stuff, no tangles. And hair is healthier than it's ever been.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Maybe it was an erroneous purchase on my part, but for context: I have 3a type curls that tend to get moderately dry in the winter. The regular DevaCurl One Conditioner wasn't cutting it so I thought I'd try this. It made my hair way too soft and weighed down.I did manage to find a happy medium: I use the regular DevaCurl One Conditioner and, after my shower, I spray It's a 10 Miracle Leave in Product on my curls before applying my gel.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  I am 3A in curls, with very fine hair.  This does NOT weigh down the curls at all.  It may seem drying at first, because I use a ton of conditioner everyday, but this is the perfect amount, once you get used to it.  I use the Coconut styling cream after using this product, and my curls are nice and bouncy, without being crunchy or frizzy.

After I wash my hair if I want to wear it curly several days in a row by day 3 it is starting to get a little dry despite the styling creams I put in it. So I like to use this on day 3 or 4 to re-moisturize my hair. When I condition my hair before doing the wash and go I always have several people complimenting my curls and asking what I use in my hair.  I also use a small amount sometimes as a leave in conditioner if I am wearing my hair in a bun. It smells good to me. I have no complaints. It came quickly. Was packaged appropriately. None had leaked out during transport. Very happy with my purchase.

Best product for curly hair! I started with curl deva nearly two years magi and haven't use md any other product. The decadence gives a little more moisture without the heaviness of other products.

I’ve used this product for years. There’s no way they did not change the formula. In recent months, I noticed a change in the look and feel of the product. I didn’t think anything of it. However, I wish I had. Deva curl products have ruined my hair. It’s as if they put relaxing chemicals in their products. Some strands of my very curly hair have become completely straight while others have just loosened. It has also changed the texture of my hair. I am mortified. I saw that people were speaking out but didn’t stop using their products because I didn’t see a change in my own hair but I trusted them too much and now my hair is damaged. Even if you haven’t seen a change in your hair, please stop using these products. It’s not worth it to wait and see if it will ruin your hair too.

Love love love Deva curl decadent conditioner! I use it as a leave in conditioner and mine and my daughter's curls are pop pop popin'!!All I do is wash my hair rub this conditioner all over my wet hair. Scruch my hair with my hands and the curls start to form!! I just let it air dry for about an hour to let the conditioner clear and really set in!!Best wash and go and day to day curls💃

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
!!!!!My hair has been falling out (after just one bottle) and matting every single day. It is absolutely horrifying. 4 pics show the gradual damage from color and texture change to severe breakage. All my blood test results came back perfectly normal and there is no other explanation. My hair knots and matts every day and barely curls, the texture of my hair is unrecognisable it feels rough and crunchy. The hair loss is constant and so dramatic. I stopped using DC one year ago now. I had to chop it off. My hair is growing back but my curls and overall fullness are definitely gone. Beware!!

Love love love this product. My daughter has beyond super dry curly hair.seriously I could put so much conditioner on her hair that it would be dripping product and leave it in there without rinsing it and in 2 hours her hair was dry again and FrIzZeD OUT! I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on all  kinds of product that claim to help, however none truly helped her hair. I put this in her not to much and I run my fingers through her hair (which I now can do) her hair is so soft so healthy and so pretty!! She wakes up now with beautiful locks and not frizzy nest. I have even used it on my hair and it wasn't to greasy. I did purchase the curl gel as well and put just a squirt or two in her hair while it's still wet.

If I could rate negative stars I would. The item description(which has since changed) was for a 2 pack of 32 oz bottles. I know it’s a great deal so I ordered it, turns out it’s a lie, was a 2 pack of 3 oz bottles which is NOT a good deal.  I email their customer service and the response is simply....the description was wrong, it has been fixed, thank you.  Needless to say I will NEVER shop with them again.

The price is just too high. I found something I like more than this. Yes to carrots nourishing conditioner. Price is way lower and I like how my hair feels more with it.

I had tried this conditioner as part of a travel/sample kit a month or so ago. The consistency is a light to medium cream which I was thinking could not possibly do anything for detangling on 4a natural hair.  To my surprise this product has great slip and made my detangle process sooo much easier.  It has a pleasant smell - not too strong and rinses easily. I will purchase this again.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I've seen in some reviews that this is not an authorized seller of DevaCurl products. Honestly, I can't tell the difference between this and what I've purchased at Ulta.Either way, this product cleanses, moisturizes and has wonderful slip for detangling my 4a/4b coily hair. I don't find the scent unpleasant or overwhelming. This is the best product I've found for gently cleansing my hair.

I used this product before I got it as a gift From a friend  in a smaller bottle and it was amazing for my hair. This one I ordered from amazon and it’s very different consistency, much thicker and it doesn’t smell the same.I was happy to find a large bottle well priced but I won’t be reordering, It makes my hair heavy and it feels like it’s not rinsed out when it dries. I’ll try to purchase from Ulta or Sephora.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Devacurl is truly amazing, I’ve been using for 2 months and can see so many positive changes including less frizz, more curl definition. I’ve received a lot of compliments since the change. Curly girl method has truly worked for me & I’m very exciting to continue to see what these products can do long term! For the price, the products actually last a while as well. I have half a bottle left after 2 months

Mine was sold by ""Gold Fulfillment"", who shipped me ""No Poo Decadence"" shampoo instead of conditioner. I didn't notice until after I'd opened it and started using it. I initially thought it was my mistake, but I looked back at the order, and I did indeed order the conditioner. Needless to say, I'm pretty annoyed.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I’m sensitive to strong, floral or woody scents so this product was too much for me. It wasn’t as moisturizing for my hair type as some of the other brands I’ve tried. It might be great for other hair types though so if you enjoy strong scents, this might be for you

I recently starting using Deva Curls. Just a few weeks ago I decided to go blonde for the summer. Going blonde= no more curls. Lucky I used the Deva Curls during the process, which lead them to not become damage. So yes I do love this product in every way. I use everything down the their styling products. I totally recommend this to everyone especially my tight curly headed girls!

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have purchased this more than 3x already, I truly love this conditioner. It leaves my hair so moisturized and soft, with a pleasant smell that reminds me of babies lol. I definitely will keep repurchasing this product. I have coily thirsty curls (3c-4a type) and yes it works for me! I use it as a leave in conditioner and I use lots of it. Plus, it’s waaay cheaper here than in stores, literally half the price.

Love DevaCurl, so I thought I'd try their Decadence line. I've noticed my hair seems a bit more curly/less frizzy with this stuff vs their regular forumla, but also everyone LOVES the smell of this stuff vs the regular stuff. My husband, strangers, my cat.Great product + great smell = win win

I use this conditioner plus the shampoo and supercream on my three year old who has super tight ringlet curls. The conditioner leaves her hair nicely moisturized. We’ve been using this for about a year and a half. It’s the best product I’ve found for super curly hair!

I have ordered this product in the past, but I was exceptionally happy with this most recent purchase due to the packaging. In the past, the bottle has come in a large box and sometimes exploded due to shipping and handling. However, this order was nicely packaged in a fitted box! So bravo to the team that packaged this product!Also, to all my curly friends, this conditioner works wonders for my curls! It leaves your curls feeling moisturized and soft!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I am in love with this product!!! along with every other devacurl product out there.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling crazy soft, less frizzy, and ready to curl right out of the shower.  At this moment I use this conditioner along with the coconut super cream I do not shampoo, only maybe once a week, but I condition everyday. My very frizzy kinda awkward curls turn into perfect banana curls, when used along with the super cream.  I can 100% tell a difference in the quality of of my hair when I use a devacurl product and when I don't (when I run out  and forget to order :(  ) An added plus is it smells good to!  I deff would recommend this to anyone with curly hair.  Devacurl's products are amazing and I'm so happy someone introduced me to them.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I leave some of the conditioner in my 3C curls because the cuticle tends to stand up making my hair dry and frizzy. This conditioner is a little lighter, defines and moisturizes very well. It dries a little quicker than some of the thicker conditioners I've used. Smells great! I like DevaCurl but of course not all their products have worked for for my type of hair - I'll be ordering this one again.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
""Decadence"" is my Fall-Winter go to.  It has wonderful moisturizers.  Spring-Summer is back to ""One Condition"" normal, as ""Decadence"" can make your hair too moist in humid conditions.

Smelled strongly of alcohol and was very thin. Not like the decadence I have used in the past. I think this formula is a fake.

We are good with the product, works wonders on my daughters very tight naturally curly hair. Smells great and makes her curls soft without frizz. MyProblem was the packaging. It came with a broken nozzle and was leaking conditioner all over the bag. 😑

Love the product but this is the third or fourth time it has arrived broken! I'm thankful it didn't leak all over this time. I have saved the pump from an old bottle...my saving grace. Will try a different company that cares about packaging...if I remember next order.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Happy to find this on Amazon. I got more product for my money than buying this at the salon. The pump is the best part!I have curly hair and I am a 3C so this product works perfectly for me. I put some of this product in my water bottle, spritz my hair and then coat with this leave in conditioner. No build up,,,thank goodness! At night I do the same thing and also put in a homemade natural Shea butter mixture. Then do a 2 strand twist. The two go together nicely. My hair is nice and curly and soft in the morning. :)Highly reccomend this product.

This is my favorite conditioner. There are three curly heads in my family so this stuff goes quick. I use this conditioner for multiple uses like co-wash and leave in. I have 3c hair type for reference.

I can’t really smell any scent. Or would be nice if it had one. But then not everyone likes the same scents. Anyway, it’s very moisturizing. Works well in my wavy hair.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
So far the best conditioner I've used for my hair. I used to just buy whatever was cheapest cause I figured soap was soap, but since using it my hair feels noticeably stronger. It doesn't quite have the same sleekness, or shininess of some other stuff I was using, but my hair doesn't frizz as easily the best day.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I've used this product for a while now and this is definitely not the real stuff. My hair consistently comes out when I run my fingers through it in the shower, when before it would only be a couple strands. Not ordering this one again.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This is my favorite devacurl products from their line! especially great for 2b / 3c curly hair that tends to dry fast. I like to use this after using olaplex no.3 co wash with my favorite peppermint shampoo.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Deva Curl has the best products! I usually buy at Ulta but it’s cheaper on here. The cap wasn’t on tight so when I received it it had leaked out some but since it’s tightly wrapped in plastic there was no mess. But to be fair I live in Arizona where in gets hotter that 100 degrees so that could have caused the cap to pop.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I'm a big fan of the devacurl products but I don't know how I feel about this conditioner it's a little watery but I'm still giving it a chance. I have really thick curly hair and I feel like it's just not as conditioning as I would like it to be.

I have been using Deva products for about 3-4 years and this is the one product I cannot do without.  I use it alone, or in combination with the supercream for my wavy/curly hair.  Keeps it shiny and manageable.

The controversy with DevaCurl aside, I had grown tired of their products for a while now. My scalp is itchy, my ends are dry (even after a 4-inch cut), and my roots are extremely weighed down from product build-up. Save your money. There are plenty of other, more affordable products (Shea Moisture, Curlsmith, etc.) that are way better for your hair and do what DevaCurl claims to do.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
MY FAVORITE!! I've never been able to operate on a ""wash & go"" style until I was introduced to Deva. This accompanied with gel and cream makes my life simpler! My hair has also never been healthier. Typically when I've reached this length(down my waist) it's so dry and dead it needs cut off and a fresh start. Not now!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
My curly frizzy hair drinks this stuff up.  No, it won't get rid of the frizz.  Nothing but straightening or glue can do that, but it makes my hair feel soft and smooth after a wash.  And, it's sulfate free so it doesn't impact coloring or keratin treatments!

If you could see my hair!  I love how moist this conditioner leaves my hair.  Silky, full of body and ready to be played with.

There have been several reviews that say this product is not an authentic Deva Curl product; however, I compared it directly to product purchased at the same time from Deva Curl and they are the same product.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I really didn't like this product compared to the original One Conditioner. It doesn't feel like it does any long-term benefits for my hair. It works fine for styling, but the original conditioner would leave my hair silky and smooth when I rinse it out. This one doesn't. It also made my hair poof-ier when I don't use any products after showering.I assume all hair is a little different and this stuff just doesn't work for mine. The original is great though. I shouldn't have messed with a good thing but I figured I'd give this a shot. I just wish I had bought a smaller bottle for my trial.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This is not real DevaCurl product. The consistency of it is cheap and not moisturizing whatsoever. My hair felt so dry like hay after using this. Go spend your money on the real deal in stores or on their actual website. I spent too much money on what probably turned out to be $2 suave in a DevaCurl bottle.

DevaCurl One Condition is good but I must say I love this One Condition Decadence. It is very moisturizing for my hair and my hair just drinks it up. The 32 oz bottle is great because the 12 oz bottles only last long enough for 2 washes of my thick, super curly hair (and that's using it sparingly). With this bigger bottle I am able to use as much as I need and it lasts so much longer. I am just now purchasing another bottle after running out last week.

I’ve gone back and forth with this product for years. I can get suckered into something new for curly hair. Every time I come back to this product. The smell is wonderful and conditions exactly how I need it to.

thick and  waxy, does not condition. Rather, made my hair look greasy.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I normally use this product and love it, but this particular one has a weird consistency. It’s so thick that it won’t come out of the bottle. I have to take off the top and shake several times for it to even come out. Not sure if it’s defected or what

This is great for curly hair.  I wouldn't be without it.  I leave a little on the ends to keep my hair moisturized and looking great.  Afterwards I use a gel or other product that seals in the moisture.

I’ve used this product for a while and it never disappoints. My hair is soft and smooth.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Love this Conditioner and my favorite part is that you can use it as a leave in as well. I have very curly 3b hair with a lot of volume and this conditioner controls it and leaves it looking all moisturized. I don't usually have to use any other product on my hair, I just rake the conditioner through and let air dry.It's not heavy either: and the smell is great! Not over powering and you can still get random hints of it throughout he day.I'm always getting compliments on my hair (how it looks and how it smells) when I use this!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This product works great - better than the regular One Condition. The reason I give it only 3 stars is the fragrance. It is so strong that it gave me a migraine and it violates my workplace fragrance-free policy. PLEASE make an unscented version of this product!

"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have never used the official product so I'm not totally sure about the product's authenticity. The smell is odd. The best way I can describe it is creamy. It's tolerable but you don't want it in your hair. I personally though this might be the no-poo and not the conditioner when I first bought it but since my hair has grown longer, my hair responds to it better. When I use it, it is just as a detangler before I shampoo or if I run out of my favorite conditioner. I won't buy again but it may work for someone else.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Expensive and overly rated. Not worth the money.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I really like this curly hair product. The 4-star rating is because of the fragrance- it is way too strong for my liking.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I hate the new Decadence line from Deva Curl. I have used their products for almost a decade.. My go-to choice for YEARS was the discontinued formulations No Poo and One Conditioner for Color treated hair. This new formulation is truly awful. My hair reacted badly to it, it became stressed, unruly- frizzy, and brittle. This has not changed over acclimatization time. This formulation has significantly set my hair condition back to the days of mainstream shampoos and conditioners. Gone was the gentle and lovely EO scents, now mainstream style per-fumy scents that give me an instant headache EVERY time I use it.  The consistence of the products  is thin and watery not the thick lush lovely conditioning my hair received from the discontinued product that left my curls gorgeous.  I am beyond disappointed. So very sad.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I love the product but when I opened the protected plastic that was around the bottle a lot of conditioner had leaked.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I had been a Devacurl one condition original user for a couple of years, but felt like I wanted something heavier just last year. Unfortunately I was reminded why silicone is not a good choice for me. Luckily I found out devacurl came out with new options and decided on this one based on my hair type (not sure it's special number code). I used this right after an experiment with a horribly drying shampoo, and it completely hydrated my hair! It also makes it feel thicker, which I love since I have fine hair. I even tested the hydration by straightening my hair, and it worked really well at keeping my hair quenched and giving my hair body and shine! I love this. And I like the milky smell to it. Will continue to use.

My hair is very curly, thick and dry this is great for my hair. This conditioner is all I use now.

Best slip for detangeling of any product ever!  So moisturizing!  The Decadence line is definitely my Holy Grail!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
For my super dry curly caucasian hair this stuff is a godsend.  I have tried many other [cheaper] alternatives, but always came back to the original deva one conditioner.  Now that the Decadence is around I stopped even trying to find a cheaper alternative - the slip to this conditioner is amazing.  If you are a curlygirl, I would not use this as a leave in - and I can usually leave weekly conditioning oil in my air!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I love the softness of my curls and it smells wonderful!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I'm not in love.  I have thick curly hair and use the One Conditioner. I was hoping this new Decadence would be thicker and silkier, but my curls feel really coarse and are super hard to untangle. In the bottle the smell is great, like a pina colada.  In my hair it smells like a wet dog. I won't be buying this product again.

I've used this product since it came onto the market but it is hard to find locally without driving into the bowels of horrendous traffic and awful national chains. If I could buy it at a locally owned shop, I would but I can't. It's an excellent product for anyone with delicate curly hair.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have for using the original DevaCurl One condition for almost 3 years. So, wanted to give this new product a try. Definitely not as good as the original love. I use one condition as a co-wash and little leave in. But this product is not moisturizing enough for some reason.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I've been using Deva products for years and couldn't be more disappointed. This conditioner is awful. It is nothing like the One Condition Deva. It left my hair dry and frizzy. Results were like using a cheap hotel product. What a waste and disappointment.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
My hair LOVES this stuff.  I've been using DevaCurl products for quite a while, but my hair was really dry and frizzy.  This stuff rocks!  Much better than the regular conditioner.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I think this might have damaged my hair, and without a doubt it didn't help it.  I have thin, apparently fragile hair and after using this one time, I have many broken hairs and frizz all over the place!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This was not an authentic DevaCurl product. The consistency, smell, and performance were way off. I'm very disappointed. Do yourself a favor and buy directly from the company or from a salon/store you can trust.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Been using One Condition for years as a leave in and love it.  Tried this just to change it up but its not as thick.  Not sure why its considered a heavier conditioner, I find it lighter.  Once done with bottle going to switch back to the original.  Still a great product but not as good as One Condition (which smells better too).
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
It is nothing like the One Condition Deva.  My hair looked horrible with it and I am a big big DEVA FAN!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I mistakenly bought decadence. It's completely different than DevaCurl One Condition (without decadence in the name). I am sad. Smells like any generic coconut conditioner and leaves my hair feeling the same. Someone warned me about discounted diva curl as not the real thing... I kind of wonder...
"

I spent the money thinking that this would be the same product that I found at my saloon... but this isn't the same thing. It's not as creamy nor as thick as they claim. My hair started falling extensively the first time I tried it. I tried it a second time to make sure that it wasnt just a bad hair day..: I have used it twice so far and wish I had never wasted my money. If you want the real deal- please go to your  local saloon to buy it.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Love this product! Hair had been over processed with straightening and coloring so it looked like I had a wreaked beach wave. After switching to decadence one condition and no poo wash my hair is at a 3b curl level (check Pinterest for curl levels).  It is worth getting the larger 32oz size as your hair remains hydrated and allows you to go days between full wash. I use this conditioner as a way of refreshing hair between washing pending workouts, etc.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
At first, it worked great for my daughters hair. Helped it grow and all. But with continual use over a wife’s months, her hair started to become dry and brittle. I thought it was something I was doing wrong but once I switched to a new shampoo and conditioner her moisture has started to come back along with the use of hair oil and a new hair care routine. Will never use this stuff again.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Smells deceptively ok in the bottle but when applied to hair is a horribly strong, heavy, fake/ chemical perfume smell. Literally lasted for days - 2-3 days later still smelling it in hair. Not at all like the regular one condition or gel products - those scents are light and don't linger . Can't stand it, even though makes beautiful curls. I called Devacurl and they offer no scent-free versions of any conditioner. Total shame!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Not sure why all the poor reviews. I love this stuff! My hairdresser taught me to keep it in (don't rinse out) and then towel dry my hair (I use a tshirt). My curls are soft, and my hair looks so much healthier. Been a curly girl forever and this is the best product I've used.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I love love love this product. It smells amazing, very lightweight (I have type 3b curly hair so this is good for my cowashing days) and it defines the curls and makes them very soft and touchable.  The only problem is that i have to apply alot of it if I want to use it as a leave in and since this product is more on the expensive side, that is a bit of an issue. But, it is very great to use to detangle in the shower as well.

I have been using DevaCurl conditioner daily for a few years, and when I needed a refill decided to try this one.  It does seem to be more moisturizing; jury is still out on whether it's worth the extra $$ that is being charged for it.One star deducted because the shipping was TERRIBLE.  Despite being billed as Prime shipping, it took 9 days to arrive.  Also arrived with a busted pump.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I don't love their entire line, but I keep coming back to their conditioner. It doesn't provide a lot of slip, so I have to use more than I would of say Biolage (what I've used for years!), but it is a lot more natural so I like that.  After rinsing out with cold water I take my soaking wet hair and apply like a half tsp of coconut oil to my hair and scalp and wrap it with a microfiber twistie turbie. This gives me the best curls!  The coconut oil really helps lock in the moisture but it works best on soaking wet hair!  If I wrap in a towel before applying the oil it just gets frizzy, as it's hydrophobic, the oil is a barrier so if there isn't enough water on the hair, its really just sealing the moisture out instead of in.  Too much coconut oil and you look like a grease ball lol.  I am pretty dry person, It takes a week for my hair to get oily.  So I only wash my hair twice a week.  The coconut routine has helped with my dandruff, but again, it's important to apply it while your scalp is still soaking wet and only a tiny amount, I just use whats on my finger tips.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I’ve been using the DevaCurl products for several years now. I like the way it smells and feels and makes my thick coarse hair soft and with excellent curl definition. I’m the kind of curly girl that almost never actually uses even the No Poo shampoo. I slather on the conditioner, work out the tangles,  don’t rinse it out at all, and let it dry naturally. I’ve tried other hair products that are sulfate free, no parabens or silicones, but DevaCurl is the one I always come back to because it is so reliable. Another plus—it’s cheaper to get through Amazon than to buy it at other salon stores!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This stuff smells like Johnson & Johnson, not Devacurl. It does absolutely nothing for my hair unlike the real Devacurl conditioner. Felt like I was putting body lotion on my hair when I used it.... no thanks.I noticed other reviewers had the same complaints before I purchased but decided to give it a shot since some people seemed to have received the real thing. I have no idea how Amazon continues to sell a product that has 0 quality assurance/is not legitimate, but it's definitely making me rethink other purchases I make on here.Not worth the risk, especially if you're unfamiliar with the product and may not be able to tell if you've received a (terrible) dupe.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
It's so difficult to find SOY FREE hair products that are kind to my natural curls! I never used the original DevaCurl conditioning products for this reason but now I'm so, so happy I'm able to use Deva products because my hair loves it! I have 3a/3b curls and I use this every time I wash. My curls seem revitalized and bouncy. I personally enjoy the smell and will definitely pick up another bottle when this one runs out!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This is a vast improvement to the original One Condition. My hair has pencil sized S curls, coils and tight frizz without product. I use this to condition after cleansing with NoPoo Decadence. Fabulous detangler just using fingers, then run a wide tooth comb through once to remove any shed hair before rinsing. I use this as a curl styler as well, adding another product's styling paste where I have frizzy patches (crown) and for lift. No root clips needed!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I’ve been using deva curl products for around 3 years now and have ordered them from amazon from time to time with no issues. This time however, the conditioner I received is nothing like what I’m used to. This product smells like chemicals and plastic rather than the normal floral scent that the decadence conditioner has. It also is not as thick and rich as the teal product. Finally, when I used it on my hair it made my hair very dry and tangled. I will no longer order any more deva curl products from amazon. Buyer beware!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have struggled to find hair products that actually work with my hair. No need to look any further.  I use this conditioner for all my hair care needs.  I use it as a conditioner but also apply to my hair when wet or dry as a styling cream.  Leaves my curls hydrated, defined and looking good for days! ( I only wash my hair a couple times a week).  This can be heavy for daily use for some so test on your own hair but this has made me love my hair, finally!

KNOCKOFF! Do not buy. Arrived wrapped in three usps bags, broken top and oozing conditioner. Daughter has insane curly hair and was forced to accept and use it. Smells like paint and cardboard. Left her hair heavy, lifeless and gross. Been using Deva Curl decadence for years from Ulta. Read ingredients - not the same, and label not the same as purchased from the store. Contacted amazon for a full refund.

I really like this conditioner. The smell is really strong the first time you use it, but the second time I didn't notice it.I felt like my curls were more moisturized and defined than they've been in a long time.I wash with apple cider vinegar, detangle with this conditioner then leave it in after adding Deva Curl gel and squeezing out the excess.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This stuff is great! I've been using it for over a year now, and I love it!  My hair is much healthier now that I've stopped using all those terrible detergent shampoos and conditioners that just coat your hair instead of bringing out the natural beauty and curl.  No more dry hair for me!  It's silky and soft and shows a beautiful natural curl that I get compliments about.

It is just this year that I started using the Deva Curl products.  And I love them all!  For years I fought my curly hair and tried to beat it into submission.  I don't have to do that anymore.  And my hair is so much softer, and I don't have to put so much time, energy (and curlers) into my hair.  I wash it with No-Poo, use the conditioner and a spray between shampoos.  Easy!  Love it!

Great product at a reasonable price. Has helped with thinning hair. My daughter’s hair started thinning and falling out. This helped keep it from falling out and thickened her hair in just a few weeks.  She said it makes her hair soft, less frizzy and shinier. It also has a light and nice scent. Highly recommend DevaCurl and seller.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Love this product, it’s a must have for my naturally curly hair to stay soft. Only gave it a 3 because i wouldn’t buy from this seller again. it came open and messy. At least it was in a bag so it wasn’t too bad. Could have happened during shipping since there was no packaging in the box to hold it in place. But the plunger doesn’t work either, so that’s annoying too
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
My stylist warned me about purchasing salon quality products from Amazon and I should’ve listened. This is NOT Deva Curl. The product doesn’t even smell the same. I have been using Deva Curl on my thick, naturally curly hair for years- and this is NOT it.DO NOT BUY!! Not even sure what this is- but my hair is hard and breaking off.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have combo hair - it is very curly underneath and straight on the top. I'm overall really happy with the product as I was looking for something to support the curls, however, I still have the frizz. Bummer...So if I could create a conditioner that has the curls retainer of this plus the moisturizer of lets say...Humectress! That would be the 5 star all the way around.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This new line from DevaCurl is fantastic! I have naturally curly hair, and over the years have used every product I could find. Some work, some clearly didn't as evidenced by my either flat, weird hair, or my hair that looked like I stuck my finger in a light socket. DevaCurl products help keep it curly and happy! The new Decadence line is thicker, conditions more than the ""regular"" and smells fabulous. I would say if you have sensitivities to scents, I would try a smaller bottle first, it's very fragrant, and sticks around for a bit. Great stuff!
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have purchased this size directly from Devacurl and at salons. It is always sealed. This came with the foil seal missing and smells different than the bottle I have at home.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I had been wanting to try DevaCurl products for a long time so I finally purchased this conditioner. This product almost seemed like it was watered down. I'm talking I would have to pump like two big handfuls to cover my hair, and my hair is like medium length. I am going to give DevaCurl another try as they are so highly rated, but I'll be buying elsewhere. I truly don't think this product was real, as it really did nothing to help my curls. In fact my hair didn't really feel conditioned at all.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I will never buy another brand for my curly girls’ hair. There is NOTHING on the market that comes even close to how wonderful these products are. Devacurl is worth every single penny. You get what you pay for, so if you’re looking for cheap prices, expect cheap products and results.

I have very fine flat silky lifeless light brown hair naturally and get bleach highlights every four months but I've been getting a perm every six months and this as well as other Deva Curl products have literally kept the perm curly/wavy and has saved it from getting too dry.

This is a LIFE saver for anyone with curly hair. I was advised by a Deva Cut specialist to put this on my wet hair and use my fingers to comb it into my hair, with my head down so my hair doesn’t get too flat on top. I don’t need to rinse it out. Everyone’s hair is different but this conditioner and technique works for me. I have recommended it to all my friends and family with curls.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
THis is NOT the deva curl decadence one conditioner. It is counterfeit. I have been using deva curl products for 5 years so I am familiar with the one condition and this is not it. What is in the bottle does not smell like deva curl one conditioner and does not work at all. It does not detangle my hair. Do not buy from this seller.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This has been my favorite conditioner for my curly hair for 5 years now. It is very conditioning and does not weigh my hair down. It smells fantastic and it is well worth the price because it does not have all the added chemicals that drug store conditioners have. Since it is a green product it has made my hair way healthier and it lasts a long time. My boyfriend has even started using it which is saying something!

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
The packaging was a mess.  And you could tell that someone had filled this bottle with something else.  It wasn’t even fully filled.  The smell is definitely off, I guess you get what you pay for 🙁. Wish I had sorted the reviews by most recent...super bummed!

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
This is an awesome conditioner for dry frizzy curly hair. You can use it as a leave in conditioner or rinse it out to use with other styling products. It has a beautiful fragrance as well. The consistency is fairly light, definitely not heavy. It leaves my unruly curly frizzy hair smooth and easy to style.. This product will definitely encourage your hair to curl so I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STRAIGHT STYLE...  THIS IS MY GO TO CONDITIONER.Very pleased.

High porosity curly haired peeps who need extra moisturizing may find it with the DevaCurl Decadence. The original DevaCurl condition wasn't enough for my thick 3a curls. My hair just soaks up the Decadence and has more sheen with this conditioner.

For kinky curly natural hair this is the best product I have found yet.  Deeply moisturizing and defrizzing.  I even use as a leave in andwatered down in a spritz bottle for retouching. One reviewer mentioned it being more watery than the original Condition One.. that must have been a knock off because this product is VERY thick.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I don't like to spend a lot of money on products, but I splurge for this one. I find it helps with daily control of my frizz and dryness, but isn't quite as thick as I'd like it to be to really stick in, so I need to use quite a bit which gets expensive.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have fine, wavy hair, and I live in a desert climate with extremely dry air. This stuff works to keep my hair moisturized, even in the arid climate. It also doesn't seem to weigh me down too much, although my stylist sometimes likes to leave some in after rinsing. I can't manage to do that without it looking greasy, but if my hair was any thicker it would be fine. Love Deva.

Long time user of DevaCurl products. Also am a regular customer of the salon in NYC. The latest bottle I purchased was a bit off.

I adore this line of product, it makes my unruly curly hair soft, manageable and full of life. However, it also makes my hair fall out in clumps and my scalp sore and tender to the touch after about 6 months of continued use. Immediately upon switching shampoos the hair loss stopped. After much research I discovered it's a common problem amoung users. Not sure if it's due to their formula change or not but I'd rather have frizzy bland hair than be bald.

My hair cannot get enough moisture.  I have fine, super curly, wants-to-be-frizzy, long, dry hair.  It's a commitment, I tell ya!  But my hubby and kids love it, so I won't consider cutting it.  Without this product, I'm not sure I'd have a choice.  My hair just drinks it up happily!  If you don't have super-curly or super-dry hair, this would probably be too much.  But for hair like mine, I use it for most of my cleaning and conditioning (every 2-3 days, with a No-Poo cleansing about once every 2-3 weeks).  I do still use an additional leave-in conditioner (SheaMoisture Strengthen, Grow & Restore Leave-In Conditioner, Jamaican Black Castor Oil) because my hair requires SOOOOOO much moisture and conditioning.  But for many people this would be enough.

"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Decadence is more watery than the other One Condition products (In the past I have used both the green and white label One Conditions and love them both!), so it requires that you use more of the product thereby getting less bang for the buck. Given how expensive these bottles are, this is a definite minus.Also, this conditioner has left me with more frizz than I usually have with the other One Condition conditioners I have used. Think I will go back to using them once this bottle is gone.

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I LOVE Deva products, but this one was not great for my hair type. I am a 2b/2c and I found that both the Decadence No-Poo and One Condition weighed my hair down too much. My Deva stylist agreed and said it was likely because my hair is already plenty moisturized.I would recommend this product to someone who needs more intensive moisturizing than the original DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition can provide.

I wanted to love this product, but it is too moisturizing for my curly hair type.  I have curly hair and this is for SUPER curly hair.  I noticed after using it for several days, my hair wouldn't curl as well after styling which makes me think it is too heavy for my hair type.  Although, I have to say it smells wonderful and feels so good in your hands!!!!  But the the Deva Curl One Condition is more appropriate for my hair type.  I hope they update the One Condition to make it smell more like the decadence!

"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have been a longtime Deva Curl user and have always purchased my products through a salon - and never been disappointed. After seeing all the wonderful reviews here, I decided to order this for the convenience of it and am sorely disappointed. After using this and No Poo Decadence for about 4 weeks, my hair turned dry and brittle. Nothing else changed in my routine other than using this. I kept using them hoping things would get better but they never did. I have since gone back to my salon and purchased product from them and my hair is once again soft and manageable. My stylist said to beware buying these products from non-authorized sellers as the products can be diluted or can be old. I called Deva Curl directly and they confirmed that only authorized sellers have guaranteed products. That means I'm out some cash and just threw away more than half-filled bottles.  :(
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
The very best conditioner for curly girls (and guys, I'm sure). My curls drank this stuff up; it took quite a while for my hair to transform from dry to manageable. It may take a couple of months for your hair to look healthy if you're like me, but be patient, it's worth it.I'm not affiliated in any way with the product line, but I swear by the DevaCut and products.(I used to be loyal to Ouidad, but the expense and finding a trained stylist in my area was a deterrent and frankly, my hair looked better with a professional DevaCut.)NOTE: Use only fingers to ""comb"" through hair, never a tool like a comb or brush, just never, not with curly hair.It's a great product and I like the way it smells. I use it daily, even on non-hair-washing days. After experimenting, I leave a dollop in my hair after running my fingers through roots to ends.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
The decadence seems to leave some sort of buildup I can't wash out and I had to stop using it. The original One Condition is much better. This is coming from someone with very thick 2C high porosity hair.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Unfortunately this is too greasy, leaving my hair WAAAAYYY weighed down. Unless you have really coarse hair that wont go flat under all the moisture this product isn't recommended.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
Disappointing. I thought with a name like Decadence it would be the thickest and most moisturizing of Deva’s conditioners but it is thinner (more liquidy, less creamy) than either the DevaCurl or the DevaCare One Conditioner. Not softening for my 3c curls, no slip at all.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I have extremely thick curly hair that is very prone to becoming a big frizzy mess. Think Rosanna Rosanna Dana from Saturday night live. I have always been in search of the Holy Grail to tame my hair and so far this is the best it's been. My biggest issue with this conditioner and shampoo is the smell. Regular shampoo brands make a point to make them smell wonderful. This smells like some type of sour lemons. My hair winds up smelling like a combination of wet spoiled fruit and dirty hair. Product good but needs a better smell.
"
"DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner, 32oz","
I love this conditioner so far. Granted I've only used it a week, but it does provides my 3C curls the much needed moisture. I used the Deva curl - one conditioner before this and loved it. So far i haven't seen much difference between the two. I leave it on for 3 minutes or so and rinse it lightly, leaving some of it to act as a leave on conditioner. My curls stay hydrated all day. Would totally recommend this product to people with coily/curly hair.

This conditioner does exactly as it describes. It is very moisturizing and it detangles my curls. Lately every time I wash my hair my curls are so incredibly tangled and I didn't know their was a product that could help. This conditioner smells really good and when I follow this up with my Deva curl ultra defining gel the result is beautiful. My curls are soft, bouncy, and layer just right. After I finish my no poo shampoo I currently have my next order will be the decadence shampoo version of this product. This conditioner also does not weight my hair down which many conditioners have done in the best. Great product!!!Jody

I have been using DevaCurl products for several years with no complaints. My hair looks better than it ever has before. I was interested in this new product, and confidently ordered it, assuming that I would love it as much as all the other Deva products I have used. I would **highly** recommend that you see you if you can smell this at a local salon or beauty supply store before you purchase it. I am very unhappy that I spent $30+ on something that smells this awful. I've been trying to figure out how to describe it, and the best I can come up with is that it smells like cheap floral drugstore perfume mixed with musk and salt. It's gag-inducing. I'm going back to the regular One Condition, having chucked $30 in the trash.

I’ve read so many great reviews for Devacurl products and was so excited to finally try some. What a huge disappointment. The smell was pretty awful and it made my hair look terrible. No definition of curls, no volume, just a stringy stretches out mess. The first picture is my hair normally, just using conditioner and gel both from Walmart. I would not recommend this at all, I probably will not even use the rest of what is still in the bottles. Overall a huge let down and not at all worth the money.

This stuff is great for curly hair. Watch “deva curl method” videos to learn how to style. Works best with no heat- let air dry and don’t touch curls. They will keep their shape best that way. I use the gel on the days I wash my hair, and the styling cream in single curls to freshen up the next few days.

I bought this kit because I travel a lot and got tired of lugging my full-sized products with me.

I loved the devacurl curly stuff even though my hair is a mix between wavy and curly. Now that my hair is longer it made sense to try the wavy stuff thinking it would be comparable to the curl stuff. This review is based on MY experience and I know what works and doesn’t work for me is not the same for other people’s hair.  The wavy products did NOTHING for me. My hair was frizzy and not at all defined in anyway. I also broke out on the skin around my hairline (neck and behind ears, not face) that is STILL broken out after a week. My hair looked bad. I returned the products and will go back to the curly line (which also makes my hair a little frizzy still but does make gorgeous curls).

I only used this a handful of times because I realized it was drying my hair out a lot! My hair started feeling like straw after a few washes and I had to deep condition and get some coconut oil in it.The conditioner didn't seem to do much at all.I would recommend the wave maker though. I shower at night and I don't even own a blow dryer, so finding a product that works for me is hard. I am able to towel dry my hair and then run this through very lightly to not weigh my hair down and it helps a lot with the frizz and also defines my waves by morning.I didn't like the gel, as it did give my hair a crunchy look.

My son had sampled another brand for curly hair that was crazy expensive.  I had heard great things about DEVA so I bought this for him to try. He loves it all, especially the styling products.

(1) It made little baby frizzies all over the top of my hair and around my face (2) caused my ends to be EXTREMELY dry and unhealthy looking (3) smelled fine, but nothing that would make me want to buy it. (4) Glad I had this option to purchase small sizes so I could try it out instead of having to buy a full-size product. (5) I won't buy this again!

"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
It worth the $30 that I paid.  The bottles are tiny and I ended up not liking the way it worked in my hair.  The shampoo didn’t lather at all and the conditioner did not make my hair as soft and natural as I thought it would.  I have used many different products throughout the years for my curly hair. This one won’t be a repeat.

"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
I've only used the product once, but I can tell the difference. Once my hair was dry, it felt softer and seemed to have more shine then when I normally wash my hair.

I had heard so many great things about deva curl. I have naturally wavy hair and heard and read that this product can help enhance that. I got the product about 2 weeks ago and have only been able to use it twice, it makes my hair so heavy and greasy looking within a day. I can normally go about 2 days before another wash but with this I was having to wash my hair everyday. And on top of that my hair was falling out a lot more than it normally does.

I really like the products and how they make my hair stand up. The only negative so far is that in haven’t been able to get a lasting wash and go style.

"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
Bought this to try out the products before buying full size. They are easy to travel with, smell great and work great on my semi-curly frequently frizzy hair. Gives nice curl definition and frizz control without weight. Very happy with my purchase. I will buy big size moving forward.

The shampoo and conditioner work well for my hair. The curl cream and gel do not help but make hair frizzy especially when dry

This product very difficult to use. See no visible changes in my natural curly hair. It does not leave it touchable. I'm very dissatisfied.  Very pricey as well.

Pretty immediately after using the LowPoo, I started experiencing itchiness, and after reading a few more testimonials, a lot of people have the same experience. Will no longer use LowPoo. Jury is still out on the other products.

The travel kits are the perfect way to test the products before committing to buying a full sized bottle of something that might not work for you. I'm loving the products and I'm definitely buying the bigger sizes once I can.

These products smell like lemon scented bug spray. Definitely not what I expected from a salon product. I’m glad I bought the trial sizes to experiment before I bought all of their products.

My daughter bought me this kit from sephora. I never write reviews but I am so disappointed in this product. I have wavy curly hair 2c 3a curls. The smell of the shampoo and conditioner is terrible. It reminds me of being sick with the flu for a week and the smell of all the meds seeping out your skin but way stronger. The conditioner didnt even have good slip.  The cream was a little better but not much. For the price these products are just not worth it. If you want a good product the lus brands are awesome. I dont care for the leave in cream but thier shampoo and conditioner are wonderful.

"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
I have 2b-c curls .  My hair is fine and very thick.  Deva Curl products did what they said they'd do--but I didn't get a ""wow"" factor with the results. Also, they are way to pricey $$$$$!!! However, there are so many other products that put them down a few notches.  The other products I tried were so much better and way cheaper too. And did give an OMG- WOW factor. Such as: All About Curls by Zoto (Sally's carries this and it is very reasonably priced).  I LOVE all their All About Curls Products.  Another must have is JesseCurls--these products works wonders and they'll send you as many free samples as you want! And their products are so much more affordable than Deva-Curl.  Go to JesseCurls website and they have how to videos and advice and you can pick out what scents you want your products to be--they have scentless ones too.  Also I cannot live without Uncle Funky's Daughter Curl enhancer (it's speedy but worth every $$). This stuff works miracles!

"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
I feel like the best way to share feedback on this product is through a picture so you can see my hairs texture- it’s course, wavy and suuuuuper frizzzyy!! So I used this travel pack to go to Thailand and I would say, SUCCESS!

"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
I bought the  DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go kits and I love the products. The great news is, if you follow the directions on the bottles, you only have to use a little of each product and the results are great. My curls more pronounced and held in place and my is still soft and bouncy.I highly recommend this product for your natural curls.
"
"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
Nope...didn’t work and I followed the directions to a T.  Why do I always fall for these type of products.  P.s.  there’s enough product for maybe three uses if you have medium length hair.

"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
My hair feels so lightweight and smells amazing!If you use the defining gel, be mindful of how much you use because if you use too much it can feel crunchy.The styling cream is amazing and the no poo and conditioner is great too.The travel size so far has lasted me 2 weeks and it's a great way to see if Deva curl products are right for you!
"
"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
I have loose curls and, in my personal opinion, this product does not work for me.  My curls did not respond to the product as expected, no better than some cheap product I am presently using.  The scent is great, the cleanser and conditioner are good but I just don't like how either the gel and/or the cream worked with my curls. I have a friend who loves the product but she has super spiral curls and they look great!
"
"DevaCurl Curls-on-the-Go Kit, Curly","
This is a great collection of sample sizes to either try--or to use for travel. In my case, I purchased them to try which products work best on my daughter's hair... and then reuse the small sizes for travel. I like the Deva line of products, but you may need to try a few to see which works best for you.

"DevaCurl Heaven-in Hair Moisture Treatment, 16 oz","
After years of blow drying my hair every day into a smooth style, my hair stylist asked me why I didn't want to take advantage of the natural curl and wave in my hair.  I hadn't considered it because I felt that my hair was not really wavy or curly enough.  But I found that wasn't the case after she introduced me to the DevaCurl product line.  These hair care products actually boost natural wave and curl, and I found that I have much curlier hair than I'd previously thought.  So for the past few months, I've been using their shampoo and styling products and have been happy with my new shoulder-length loose tousled curls.But my hair has a tendency to get a bit dry, especially during the summer months, so my stylist recommended DevaCurl's Heaven in Hair Intense Moisture Treatment a few months after switching to my new curly style.It works well, although I don't use it as often (2-3 times a week) as it recommends on the label.  At most, I use it once a week since it's a bit time consuming to do.After washing my hair with their No Poo shampoo, I gently blot dry with a towel and then apply this thick cream throughout my hair and leave it on for about 30 minutes.  For extra conditioning, the instructions recommend putting a plastic cap over your hair, but I haven't found that necessary.  After about 30 minutes, I rinse the Heaven in Hair cream from my hair and then apply whatever styling/volumizing DevaCurl products that I want (I normally use their Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam, Styling Cream, and/or Light Defining Gel).Although this Intense Moisturizing cream feels thick and rich while in my hair, I've found that it rinses out easily without weighing down my curls or leaving any greasy residue.

"DevaCurl Heaven-in Hair Moisture Treatment, 16 oz","
Heaven in hair is amazing! First off I have fine, medium perosity curls. My hair needs a lot of moisture (winter is brutal where I live!) and is sensitive to protein.  My curls range in type from 4A (bangs), 3A in the very back and 3B everywhere else.Now the conditioner...I tried using it as a typical conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes and rinsing but it didn't penetrate deep enough and my hair was still dry/frizzy. Now I use it in the shower after I cowash (2-3 times a week depending on how dry it is/weather, etc). The steam/heat of the shower adds additional benefit too. I apply all over and then scrunch until my hair starts sectioning off naturally. Then I finger twist each section to help train my curls. Leave it on for about 15/20 minuteswhile I shave,etc. Then I rinse out most of it, leaving just a little left on my hair. I lightly scrunch with a towel until my hair isn't dripping anymore but is still really wet, then add leave-in mixed with jojoba oil and comb through.Before Heaven in hair, I had to force my hair to curl, prodding,poking and twisting. Since using this, once I comb it through the curls bounce back back and naturally clump on their own. I get gorgeous natural ringlets! I almost wept the first time it happened!After combing to make sure all the product is evenly distributed,  I follow this with scrunching a few times then diffuse and go. Sometimes I'll scrunch in a bit of gel on the ends after the leave-in too. This process leaves my curls shiny, soft and bouncey!!

DevaCurl Heaven in Hair moisture treatment in one product I try to never run out of!  Once each week I comb out my curls, shampoo my scalp thoroughly, slather my hair with Heaven in Hair Moisture Treatment and cover it with a disposable plastic shower cap.  I leave the product in my hair for 10-30 minutes then rinse out in cool water.  I try to leave a very small amount of the product in my hair for continued moisturizing.  I highly recommend this deep conditioning product for curly hair needs!

My hair is so incredibly dry nothing has ever kept it from frizzing. No my hair is greying and losing all its remaining luster. My stylist advised me to use this as a leave in condition.  At the end of the shower, while my hair is still drenched with water, I take some and work it from the ends up. For the first time in my life, I simply have the softest, shiniest ringlets. I do have to use vinegar or some other clarifying product every 2 washes to get the build up off, but there isn't another product out there -- and I've tried DOZENS -- that gives the results this does. Pity it's so pricey, but for the results, it's worth it.

This product has artificial coloring and can be left in hair??? I don't get why there are dyes in the ingredient list. I don't care if the cream is slightly blue; I want natural ingredients. Also, this is a ""deep conditioner,"" but the instructions say you can use it as a leave in... Which tells me that it's not a true deep conditioner because otherwise it would instruct me to wash it out after 30 minutes max. Real deep conditioners are formulated to pack a big punch and work quickly and leaving them in can actually weaken the hair if not rinsed out soon after application. It works all right, but not much different from a conditioner. I'm much happier with my SheaMoisture protein mask and BrioGeo Don't Despair Repair mask. Both natural and they work wonders. I've never been a big fan of Deva Curl and I doubt I'll be buying any more of their products. Come on, do you expect curlies to fall for this?

This is supposed to be a once a month treatment but for me it’s an every washing conditioner. I was my hair about 2 times a week, just because I’m a head sweater. My hair becomes so wet in heat not a pretty sight. I “wash” the sweat out then condition rinse half way out then condition with the conditioner you are suppose to rinse out, this is my leave in conditioner add gel scrunch to get water out and “plop” it until half dry and air dry

My hair becomes so wet in heat not a pretty sight. I “wash” the sweat out then condition rinse half way out then condition with the conditioner you are suppose to rinse out, this is my leave in conditioner add gel scrunch to get water out and “plop” it until half dry and air dry

I swear by all Deva products. It has allowed me to wear wash & go style with my frizzy curly mess. haha. really though, I have grown my hair out longer than ever before thanks to this great line. It keeps it healthy and strong and I feel better not using the chemicals.

It has an amazing smell and it leaves my hair feeling like silk after using it. I wish it would come in a bigger size. I sometimes use a little bit as a leave in conditioner.  I wish Amazon would tape the lids shut so no product would be waste.

I live and die by this product for deep condition or leave in. It literally transforms my hair/curls. utilizing it while simultaneously putting water with my curls keeps them soft, defined and it does not get crusty or hard once my hair dries. The only thing is I use it for deep condition every week or so. I try to sperad usage so my hair doesnt get dependant and over saturated with using it.

This arrived without the DevaCurl box, the label was applied sloppily, and the contents were coming out of the top (seems it was put in sloppily).  This is not typical of DevaCurl products I have purchased in the stores.

I have really long, thick, coarse, wavy hair and nothing seems to condition enough to tame the frizz. I've been using this twice a week for about a month now and my hair is softer and smoother than ever. I can't say I've seen continued improvement over time so I'm giving four stars, but as a quick initial improvement, I'm happy with it.

not the same consistency as if you buy it in a salon

"DevaCurl Heaven-in Hair Moisture Treatment, 16 oz","
I wasn't really sure if I would need this but I have to say that I cannot live without it.  I wash and condition my hair, rinse with cold water and apply this in the shower before I get out.  I towel my hair dry, or at least so it isn't dripping et and apply some of the Deva Curl gel and I am good to go.  It makes my hair look and feel amazing.  I can't live without it.  This is also the best price option that I could find.

GREAT Product! My daughter has extremely curly hair and a TON of it. This is thick and gets the tangles out with minimal crying.

It hydrates and has a nice smell. I usually leave it for like 15 minutes and it does the job. However, I believe it's better to use a diffuser in combination with the other Deva Curl products to have great curls.

It makes your hair feels smooth and with shine (using extra products of course) but is so flimsy you'll need a lot of product to make that happen so you'll use it 3 times tops.

if you have naturally curly hair and haven't gone to the Devacurl way your are not getting the best out of your hair. I used to use mousse and gel etc... from the stores and get my hair cut like every other person in the world does wet, pulled down and  trimmed. WRONG oh so Wrong!! I know only get my hair cut by a trained Deva Curl professional and never use anything in my hair but Deva products. The Heaven in hair is perfect for my hair. Along with the low poo shampoo. I love, love my curls now... no frizz no tangled ratted mess. Just amazing soft curls!!!

For reference, I have type 3b curly hair and have been on my curly cycle for over 2 years. I used the product twice a week after clarifying my hair for 3 months.This product worked well when I first started using it, making my curls feel super soft and manageable. However, after about a month and a half it started irritating my scalp, making it itchy and uncomfortable to sleep on even if I had just clarified, air dried, braided, and slept on a silk pillow. Build up started to accumulate at roots, which was strange considering I only applied to the ends of my hair and I hadn't changed anything in my routine aside from adding this deep conditioner. Tried to tailor my routine around it with no luck, even reducing its usage to once every week/everything other week. Was sad it didn't work out long term, I was so happy initially ):

DecaCurl is my go to hair care product line but I haven’t really seen a difference in hair moisture while using this. I’ve used this conditioner at leasg 5 times now and nothing noticible has changed in the softness or moisture of my hair. It smells interesting, not horrible, sort of chemical like. I like the consistency of it though.

Wasn't expecting it to arrive so early seeing as I didn't pay for faster shipping. But it did. Ordered it Friday Oct. 21st, and here it is Monday. I already used this product  many times before, however, always had the small jar, so when I saw the 16 once and two at that at such a price, I had to get it.If you were wondering if this deep conditioner is worth it, yes. My Curls love it so very much, and I'm talking type 3a,3b, 3c, and when it comes to my cousin that has type 4a, and 4b hair, the same thing. Her hair sucks it up.For me having low porosity hair, it takes a lot to get in moister, and this, my god it's everything. DevaCurl and their products are everything. These are my staple products for sure. The Price is worth it to me, but I can't speak for anyone else but me. At the end you have to chose for yourself.

This is literally heaven in hair, I recommended this to all of my natural and transitioning friends. I have 3C/4A hair and it immediate moisturizes my hair while applying it. I usually deep condition overnight but I wouldn’t recommend doing that with this product because the hair might become over moistured. All around a great product that has become a staple in my routine.

The first time I was introduced to this was when I got my Devacut. When they applied it, I thought ""wow, they're pretty stingy"". I assumed my fantastic results were solely a product of the styling cream. It's been years and I've spent god knows how much on all these different products... now I humbly return to devacurl. I used a quarter size of HIC DC for each half of my head. This product really helps with definition.  I can see the immediate difference as soon as I get out of the shower.

doesn't really seem to add moisture at all, just the opposite.  I end up with more tangles when I use it than when I use something else.  My hair is not wavy but not really curly either, so I cant have it getting all tangled when I am trying to wash and condition it.  I do love the tingle that you get from the mint in it, that feels awesome, just wished it actually added the moisture it claims.  I use other DevaCurl products and I love them, so I was disappointed this didn't live up to the title.

Please note: The actual product might be FABULOUS, but what I received was not!I asked for this for Christmas and got it! I was incredibly excited. I followed all the instructions very carefully but both times that I used it my hair just felt AWFUL afterwards. It felt dry, knotted, squeaky. Just horrid. Both times I caved and applied my regular Deva conditioner on my hair afterwards just to get some relief! It didn't make any sense to me at all that their regular conditioner was better than this super-awesome deep conditioner.I contacted DevaCurl and learned that Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer of their products!!!! It's extremely likely that what I got was counterfeit, and anyone else who orders here may get the same.Think about it. This size sells for $44 on their website, but it's here for $26? Seems a bit fishy.I'm now going to order ONLY from the DevaCurl website. All of the products I've gotten there have been absolutely amazing and fantastic for my hair!

For me it’s just ok. I haven’t found a great leave in yet. I also hate the smell of devacurl products....

"DevaCurl Heaven-in Hair Moisture Treatment, 16 oz","
So I actually bought this product from an Ulta and loved it! I only swear by two deep conditioners this one and TGIN Honey mask deep conditioner. So when I was moving I decided to order it on Amazon through Prime so I would not miss out on my deep conditioner.... Plus I was getting 16 oz for the price of the 12 oz so why not right? So when I received the product I smelled it. It smelled like the heaven in hair but way lighter...  I decided to use it anyway because I already bought it and did not have time to go to the store. The product works... it just takes a minute to get into the hair. My hair was extremely soft just like the one I bought from Ulta. A week later I decided to go to my local store and buy another one 12 oz for the price above. I opened the bottle and compare it to this one, and realized This product is the water down version. It still works, but I can tell the smell is not the same as the original bottle. Now I read the negative reviews (which everyone should) and realized that most people rarely read 1 star so I decided to put a 5 star because the actual product works on 3b/3c/4a/4b hair. so I think the product is amazing even if its watered down in this case. Like I mentioned earlier I only order it from Amazon because I wanted the prime status. In the future, I will just order from naturallycurly.com or Devacurl.com. Moisturizing Natural hair is already a hard enough process already without someone taking advantage of the products we use.

"DevaCurl Heaven-in Hair Moisture Treatment, 16 oz","
This is NOT the product that I've been buying from Deva for many years. Your product is green and thicker with a stronger smell. The deva heaven in hair product is pearl colored and a little bit runny. You put false product into my order.  I am able to compare the product because I have a previous jar of heaven in hair and I put two teaspoons next to each other. it was obvious that one was green and one was pearl and one had a different texture and one was much stronger smelling. I hope the people that see this review know that they should never buy from you. I'll be returning this product ASAP. Forthwith I will never buy from a supplier again that is not Deva.I will put in a picture of the two products side by side later on.
"
"DevaCurl Heaven-in Hair Moisture Treatment, 16 oz","
I read the reviews before buying this and thought I’d try it since they seemed mixed. That was a huge mistake. I use other DevaCurl products and didn’t have a problem with them so I’m not sure if this was fake or not. It did NOT feel like I was putting any kind of conditioner in my hair. It made my hair extremely tangled and felt like I was trying to comb out the knots with shampoo. The more I put, the worse it got and I ended up using a ton of normal conditioner to try to fix the tangled disgusting mess my hair had become. It was so bad I didn’t even want to try ordering it from the DevaCurl site to see if it was fake. I ended up returning it and ordered a different brand of deep conditioner. I’m not sure if the problem is a sketchy vendor or DevaCurl’s product, but if you really want to try this, I would order another deep conditioner as a backup.

I love this stuff. I use it as a leave-in in the winter when my hair turns to straw with the dryness of the heat being on all the time. I also mix it with heaven in hair once a month for an overnight conditioning and the combo is great for my hair. I use Deva products every day and my curls have changed over time to healthy and bouncy.

My favorite DevaCurl conditioning treatment. It’s expensive. I use it every couple of days and leave a little in upon rinsing.

This product is not what the name reveals.I could not comb through my hair with this product on my hair in the shower - it made more knots than it took out.  Usually with any conditioner your hair feels soft & smooth while the conditioner is in your hair & afterwards - not with this one. I had to use different product to get the knots out of my hair after using this deep conditioner. I am throwing it away.

Nope, nope, nope.  Did NOT get good results form this product AT ALL...  I am a mixed race (Filipino/Black) 'natural' with more ethnic 3c/4a, LOW POROSITY hair.  I bought this based on the YouTube videos I saw of other naturals who really loved this product.  I should also admit that I did read the reviews from some low porosity naturals who complained about the amount of PROTEIN in this product being too high for low-pos like me.  So I was a little hesitant but wanted to give it a try anyway.  I started out with my usual co-washing and conditioning, then followed up with an ACV rinse to make sure I had a 'clean slate' to work with.  I added the DevaCurl Heaven in Hair, covered with a plastic cap and the added my thermal heat cap for 20 minutes as recommended.  Rinsed thoroughly and, OMG...  I could NOT believe my eyes.  All my coils were gone from my hair - ALL OF THEM!  Not one single coil and my hair looked and felt like a GIANT, BLACK COTTON BALL.  It was dry and frizzy and did NOT lay down no matter what I did.  I wash in SHOCK!!!  I could NOT believe how awful my hair turned out.Needless to say, I spent the next few hours BACK in the shower re-washing and re-conditioning and I used my old deep conditioner to get the moisture and coils back in my hair.  Unfortunately I will be returning this product but I want all the low-po's out there to know that this is NOT the product for us.  I'm

The first time I purchased this I purchased the 8 oz. container.  Now I'm purchasing the 16 oz. container.  Save your money and purchase the larger container because trust me you will wish you would have the first time.  It really moisturizes.  I use other DevaCurl products and every once in awhile I use this and sit underneath the dryer.  I have thick wavy/curly hair that is low porosity so that is why I have to sit underneath a hair dryer for about 10+ minutes so it will get into my strands.  I loooove this product.  It smells so good.  I can't really put my finger on it, but the smell reminds me of when I was a little girl and my Mother.  You really don't need to use a lot.  I was advised by DevaCurl to use this product and I'm so happy I did.  You can't and won't go wrong with using this.  Amazon has a great price for this size product.

Maybe this works for healthy hair, but it does nothing for damaged hair - which is mostly why you would want a deep conditioner in the first place.  I finally got tired of living with the dry, crispy, unmanageable hair that results from repeated coloring, and I'm letting my gray hair grow out.  My hair is now healthier than it's been in a long time and it's nice to see my natural curls again, but no matter how I use this, whether as a deep conditioner or as a leave-in, it helps only slightly with curl definition and hydration.  Does nothing to control frizz.  I get much better results with Living Proof leave-in conditioner, and that requires a much smaller amount of product than this does.

If you have fine curly hair like I do please please try this product. It made my curls come alive. Did not make my scalp itch and didn't weight my curls down.  After three days it held my curls perfect. Love It !!!

I use this @ least once a week. I love this product. I have been using no poo shampoo and conditioner for about 2 years. Within a few days my hair was extremely dry. I found this product here and decided to use it. I see a drastic difference in my hair. It stays moisturized for a week. My curls are popping now.

My curls are returning! After damaging and straightening my hair I thought I had lost my curls forever. Strangers are now complimenting my hair again ❤️ I will continue to use Deva Curl products. Can’t wait to see what my hair looks like in 3 months. 😊

My hair responds beautifully when I use the Heaven In Hair.  Big difference in curl pattern and softness when I skip this process.  Highly recommend using this product as specified for gorgeous hair results.  Smells heavenly, too!

BEWARE!! This product is FAKE!!! It came opened and the original product is a thick green conditioner mask, this stuff is white and chunky and smells like NAIR!!! OUTRAGEOUS that Amazon allows for vendors to sale fake products. Super unhappy. I hope someone reaches out and makes this right.

Last summer I bought this mask despite the reviews which said that it was a fake product. I bought it and loved it but it was my first time trying it and I was still wondering if it was authentic.  So since I was running out and I loved the mask, I decided to repurchase but this time from Devacurl's site.  The mask I bought in Devacurl looks the same, feels the same, smells the same and works the same as the one I bought las year in Amazon, so I'm confident to say it is authentic. My baby-fine, low porosity, 2c-3a hair LOVES it so much, it is my very favorite hair mask and believe me when I tell you I've tried them all!

I purchased this in Oct 2017 and only used it a couple of times. It made my hair so completely unmanageable with horrible texture and tangles. I final ordered a sample from the DevaCurl website, and realized that the real stuff actually works! As much as I liked to save a few dollars ordering the products from Amazon, it's not worth the damage from counterfeit products in this case.
"
"DevaCurl Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask, 8oz","
Wow what an expensive product and it doesn't even provide enough moisture or slip to detangle and such little product I ran out after just 5 or 7 washes or so. I much much much prefer Shea moisture masks those come in bigger sizes for way cheaper n many of them are extremely hydrating n provide great slip....I had to use sooo much product to get any hydration and slip and even then not enough. This is probably best for hair that is in excellent condition but curly hair even virgin is dry so really who this is for I can't tell maybe very very fine curly hair but if u have thick curly hair that needs moisture look elsewhere and save your $ as this won't cut it whatsoever.

I love DevaCurl products and they made my hair look and feel amazing.  Unfortunately, I am severely allergic to something in the DevaCurl products.  When I use this product on my hair, it burns my scalp like acid.  Afterwards, my scalp began to break out with a rash and severe itching. I stopped using the product and my scalp has gotten better but not completely healed.  This has resulted in a substantial about of money spent going to the doctor and on prescription for shampoo, pills and creams.  Also, I had the same problem when I purchased from Ulta and when I purchased on Amazon.

This mask smells like a tropical vacation. I kept telling my husband that. So deliciously good! And not strong at all. It has an almost gel-ish/creamy consistency. It goes on smoothly on the hair. The smell is not overpowering once you have it in your hair. I usually leave it on overnight for the extra moisture. When it’s time to rinse is out, it comes off instantly, as if it were never on your hair - no greasy residue. It gives great moisture and shine to my curls. I LOVE!!!’

I just received this today. Initial review after the first use is not good. This went on smoothly, felt really nice, and smelled pretty good. I left it on for about 15 minutes and when I went to wash it out, I noticed that my hair felt like straw. I rinsed and attempted to comb, my hair had knotted horribly from this product. I have really fine, dry, curly hair, so using Devacurls description, this would be the one for me. I will attempt to use again and update if there is a change. All in all, this product did not do what it says it will.

My stylist used this on me and this stuff is simply amazing! (For my kinky-coily natural girls): my hair texture is a mixture of 3c in the front and some 4a/b textures in the back). I like the scent (it’s not too strong)... and although it’s pricey a little goes a long way with this product. The price with this seller is better than any in-store I’ve seen.

I've had curly hair my whole life obviously this product was supposed to be amazing and designed specifically for curly hair. DO NOT buy this stuff. It will make your hair dry and BRITTLE. it is not a curly hair friendly product. I wouldn't recommend it for ANYONE.  Buyer BEWARE

I got this product at the start of my curly journey. This product is marketed as a deep conditioner, but when i used it my hair never felt moisturized. It felt really dry.I always felt as if i needed to condition it again after using it. I did NOT like this product. I folowed the directions and attempted to use it 4 or 5 times because this was supposed to be a great quality product and was not cheap by any means.
"
"DevaCurl Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask, 8oz","
DevaCurl is by far the best leave in curl conditioner I have ever used! This product brings my wild curly hair to life, no frizz, perfect everyday curls!  It smells like I just left the salon and looks like it too! The only thing that I found an issue is it leaves a slight greasy appearance after use. Leaves my curls silky and bouncy! Love this stuff, not to mention the cost on here is so much better than at your typical beauty store.
"
"DevaCurl Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask, 8oz","
This is the best hair mask I have ever used !! I even use it sometimes on a daily basis as a conditioner. Makes your hair silky smooth like butter !! I have fine chemically treated blonde hair and it doesn’t weigh it down !!

I would normally say the price was a little high but it works! I want to get one of the other products from this company. Your hair feels so soft when you use it.
"
"DevaCurl Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask, 8oz","
Deva curl has only been such a satisfaction, but this specific product only caused dry, brittle hair. It was very difficult to de tangle. This caused me to pull out a lot of hair and cause breakage. I really would like to return it but I missed the dead line thinking giving the product time to work would help my hair adjust to it. It has a very strong chemical smell and just layers more on your hair then moisturizes. I end up having to use a large amount of my one conditioner to de tangle  my hair. All in all ruining my hair, wasting my product that I love from deva and preventing me from truly caring for my hair. Very disappointed. Definitely had high expectations.
"
"DevaCurl Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask, 8oz","
This conditioner is  unbelievable and leaves my hair moisturized, soft to the touch. I use it as a deep conditioner and as a leave in on my natural curly hair to keep it moisturized.
"
"DevaCurl Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask, 8oz","
Love this product. The expense is quite much though. Curly haired girls like myself have a LOT of hair and a company that doesn’t prioritize the experience and necessity of larger sized products for the same price just don’t sit well in my mind. The smell is eh, but the product is very nourishing.
"
"DevaCurl Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask, 8oz","
This adds so much moisture to my hair and makes it feel and look so much healthier. I really love it. I apply it in the shower before I start washing my body and so it has time to sit in my hair then wash it out at the end of the shower. It's great. :)

Beware. This product will do the opposite of what it says it does. My hair knotted up so bad after using this that my daughter had to cut giant clumps of knots out of my hair. Made it feel like straw. Do not use anything by DevaCurl. This absolutely will mess up your hair.

My hair LOVES this conditioner. I have tried every deep conditioner you can find in a beauty store and none of them even came close to this one. It leaves my hair so soft and moisturized. It's definitely worth the money. I'm not crazy about the matcha smell but it's not overpowering or anything.

Worked wonders on curls that were dried out from hair coloring.  I finger curled with a dab on each.  My hair :  3b/c,  medium density, moderate porosity.  It will become a staple.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 starts is because it does feel heavy as a leave in, even using a small amount.  Kinda feels like I am wearing a hat.

I used this once and threw it away. My fine curly hair felt damaged for days after I used it. Tangled, dry, less curly. I use some of the Deva Curl products on a regular basis, but this one is horrible. Any drugstore conditioner is 100 times better than this ridiculous ‘‘matcha butter’.

I did not purchase my products from Amazon, I purchased from an authorized retailer, but they aren’t posting my review so I am posting here too. DO NOT buy devacurl products! I have lost probably 1/3 at least of my hair from these products, my hair is damaged, it hardly curls anymore, my scalp was itchy/burning and I had a major dandruff problem while using these products. A simple google search will show you the controversy going on currently with devacurl. Don’t waste your money and don’t risk this happening to you! I believe at one time their products were good and that’s why the reviews are mostly good, but something has changed with their products and they aren’t what they used to be. Their reviews should reflect these changes. There is a current class action lawsuit forming against them for the damage they’ve caused to at least tens of thousands of people. Probably more. Don’t risk it happening to you too!

Before you purchase this product look into the current class action lawsuit against Deva Curl regarding ALL of their products. Save yourself the  heartache, hair loss and damage. Take 5 min to look on YouTube to see what is happening to other users.

Didn’t buy mine from amazon but still wanted to come on here and say this is hands down the BEST thing to ever happen to my hair.

Also the bottle is huge you don’t need much each use.

My hair is dry brittle and damaged because of traveling and using hotel shampoo and conditioner way to long. I purchased this item in the hope it would restore my hair and rewind my bad choices. I opened the bottle and I felt my noise was assaultes by a perfume store. The smell was so overwehemling I had to sit down. My stomach is still upside down from the smell. I have a very sensitive noise when it comes to smell. I wish I knew this product would be like that because I wouldn't have purchased it. The product is a greenish color amlost like a face mask color and consistency. I used the item as instructed. My hair feels amazing! It feels silky smooth with amazing body. Unfortunately i will not buy this item again because of the overwhelming smell. This is such an amazing product but wow I can't get over my migraine from it.

I have always had curly, frizzy hair.  I began using other devacurl products about 3 years ago, however just discovered this butter.  It makes a world of difference!  The product recommends 3 possible ways of using this:  a) shampoo and leave in overnight, rinse in morning; b) shampoo and leave in for up to 20 minutes, then rinse; or c) shampoo and leave in for 3 minutes.  I have found that the first way (overnight) gives the best results in remoisturizing the hair.

I have been a loyal Deva Curl client for five years! I loved their products, techniques, and even get the DevaCut. I used to love how my hair looked and felt with the products. Even when the change of ownership came and their products started to get marked up, I figured it’s still worth it. Then, for the past few months especially, I’ve noticed changes in my hair and scalp. I had been using the same products for years, no-poo shampoo, one condition, styling cream, believe-in, and ultra defining gel or the arc-angel gel. However, my scalp became itchier and itchier, dryer and dryer, and now I have dandruff I can’t get rid of. What’s worse, is my hair! It became dryer and coarser. The worse it got the more products I used and the more I washed it. I tried different techniques and brushing it differently. Always slept with a silk pillowcase AND silk bonnet. Then I figured I should get DevaCurl’s Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask. It just made things worse. My hair shed to new extremes, making my hair look flat and thin, my scalp got worse with dry patches that felt tight and hard. My hair was so dry and coarse even after washing my hair, at the end of the day it was matted. Keep in mind I have 3A/B curls, it takes quite a bit to have it matted. not tangled, MATTED. Which of corse meant I had to wash it more, and brushing through it made it fall out more! My curls werent taking shape like they used to. My curls looked more like matted, dry, haystacks that slightly waved. My scalp became sensitive to brushing, it was a nightmare! I stopped using DevaCurl in just a week and I’ve noticed a huge difference already. My curls haven’t fully recovered, but I’m hopeful they will. I will not buy DevaCurl again unless they address this and change to fix the issue. So disappointed, five years of spending money one overpriced products and this is how they repay me. I honestly just want them to go back to how they used to be.

Don’t waste your money on this. I’ve tried this 3 times on separate occasions & found that when detangling your hair with this, it isn’t great- not much slip. But once you’re done detangling & let it sit in your hair, it’s smooth when you wash it out with running water, but once it’s out of your hair, it’s worse than tangled/wet Barbie doll hair! Finger combing is impossible with this, you have to use a brush, but guaranteed that brush will be filled with your hair. I just spent over 2 hours trying to detangling my 3a/b bra strap length hair & lost a significant amount of hair just trying to detangle with a brush. In comparison, I use Shea butter’s Jamaican castor oil line up & it doesn’t take more than 15 minutes to detangle my hair in the shower. Every time I use this product, I instantly regret it when I detangle my hair. I can’t tell you how close I came to just cry at the sheer frustration I’ve experienced finger combing & brushing my hair in the shower & out the shower with this (you’re just creating more knots). I always have to bring out my trusty “knot today” leave in which instantly provides the slip I need to quickly detangle my hair WITHOUT PULLING HAIR OUT!

My hair did not do well with this product. I have 3B hair type. Soft curls but they go all around (spiral).  I did not feel the softness. I actually felt my hair like dry straw as I was rinsing it out.  Love Deva Curl product but not their conditioners.

So far, i like it. I used this and the seaweed repair together. I just did the same amount of both finger-combed it through my hair and then rinsed out completely. My curls looked more defined and so far I am pleased with the product. I exclusively use DevaCurl products. I use the No Poo, One Condition, B'Leavin, Ultra Hold Gel. And on occasion, when my hair needs it i use the Micellar Cleansing thingy, and now I will be using the Deep Sea Repair and Matcha Butter Conditioning Mask on a regular basis but as needed. I also use the hairspray occasionally and I use the No Poo dry shampoo cleanser.

So I got a really generous sample size of this in my ipsy subscription bag and I fell in love, I don’t have curly hair but I have super long hair that goes down to my behind and this made it so soft and manageable, so ofcourse I wanted to get the full size and I found it here for about $20 cheaper then sephora and Ulta, I don’t know what the deal is I had no issue with sample but this bottle had horrible effects on me, my skin would itch and every time  I used it I would have the most horrible headaches, it took me a little bit of time to figure out that this was causing them, as soon as I stopped using it my headaches went away, I was bummed because it wasn’t cheap and the sample worked so well so I tried it one more time just to be sure and as soon as I did the headache returned!!! Awful

Oh come on now!!!! My hair is now even drier. I bought this because of a tester pack given to me by Sephora and it was lovely. So what’s the deal?

This is the best conditioner for curly hair! Be aware if you’re still using silicones in products in your hair, trying to use silicone free products will result in disatisfaction with this product. The silicones prevent the botanical ingredients from penetrating the hair. Silicones create a plastic coating around your hair. It can be extremely difficult to remove. Some long term users of silicone products have to actually grow out the hair that has been treated with silicones. If you follow the curly girl method then you’ll love this product.

I have very curly, dry, coarse hair that always looked like a pile of straw. I have used DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner for over a year, but my hair was still dry. One day, I discovered this product on Amazon, and decided to give it a try. Even after the first use, my hair was soft and manageable again. I now use Melt Into Moisture at least once a week, and such a difference. I now get many complements on my hair. I love this product!

All this talk about Devacurl products, I expected much more in this moisture hair mask.  Didnt see much of a difference after using 2 times per week for 2 weeks.

This conditioner works its magic on my 3a curls. I leave it in overnight and wrap my hair in my Turbie Twist, and shampoo the next morning while it's still in my hair. When I rinse everything out my hair is renewed! I use it once a month, so even though it's pricey this tub will last me about a year I would guess.

My 9 yr old has combo hair that I have to combat. Lol on wash day it is 4c when shampoo is added. Now I am in love with this conditioner it literally just MELTS INTO THE HAIR SHAFT!!!

I really wanted to love this as a longtime Deva girl with a pro DevaChan haircut and all. While it does moisturize well, it is no good at facilitating detangljng of my very curly (3b type curls), fine, long hair. In other words, it has poor ‘slip.’ Bummer.

Don't buy this if you are expecting miracles. I put this on under a heating cap and my curls completely shrunk up. I had to wash my hair to get them to stretch out again. Perhaps it is made for straighter hair. I have 4C curls. As far as moisture goes, it did look quite moisturized at the beginning of the day. But, at the end of the day my curls were crispy. I ended up getting better results with a regular conditioner and using a mixture of coco, mango and shea butters I warmed up and applied to my hair while they were in liquid form. These usually don't work well, so perhaps the melt into moisture product work as a kind of porosity treatment to allow other products to penetrate. It is impossible to say, however, because I washed my hair twice between these 2 moisture treatments.

Deep condition for sure - however when I leave it in my hair for extra condition - as I always do - it definitely causes a strange buildup and the coconut/ shea butter/matcha butter smell goes rancid/old after a few days. Like my hair smells bad after a few days. Or the next day. Doesn't happen with the heaven in hair... so I will be using up this pot but not buying more.

Not only does this product smell AMAZING it also added a ton of moisture to my hair, leaving it soft and touchable. After using it for a month, I've definitely noticed a difference. My hair feels healthier and more hydrated. The one down side is that it seems to be leaving some build up, as my hair isn't curling as tightly as it used to. I'm going to get the Deva Curl Buildup Buster to see if that helps. Of course, this may just be a side effect of having healthier hair.

I have fine, VERY DRY, curly, delicate, color treated hair and this product made my hair extremely stiff, tangled and matted. I tried twice on clean, wet hair.

It leaves my curly hair extra straw feeling.  There is ZERO slip with this conditioning mask.  At no point was I able to comb my hair with a wide tooth comb.  Not while the mask was on or after rinsing.  My hair felt like it hadn't been moisturized in a year.  My regular conditioner provides 100% more slip and a more moisturized feeling.  I tried using this on two separate occasions, one time after using a clarifying rinse and a second after just using a regular shampoo.  My thinking was it just couldn't handle clarified hair by itself.  I was wrong, my hair felt just as dry even without removing everything from my hair prior to its use.

This is a great moisture mask that helps with detangling while it really moisturizes. Heaven in Hair was okay, but this is much better.

This does the trick.

If I could five this product zero stars, I would. I have been using DC products for one yr and love the products. I have tried melt into moisture, heaven in hair, and the protein mask on soaking wet hair. Fail. In damp hair (low porosity hair tactic). Fail. Sat under a hooded dryer, with a plastic cap, for 30 minutes. Fail. Sooooo, I tried. I really prefer to use the same prpduct line for deep conditioners. But these products made my hair feel dry, brittle, and no slip. I could not detangle my hair at all. I quickly put in Decadence one conditioner. When my hair dried, it was SUPER dry. Felt like it would break off. The next day I immediately clarified my hair using Mielle Organics exfoliating shamppo and then Mielle protein free deep conditioner.  It was excellent! Use on wet hair though, not damp. Since this conditioner ironically stripped my hair of moisture, I will co wash once a week with the decadence one conditioner, wash once a week with decadence no poo, follow up with b'leave in, and then ultra defining gel to elongate my coils (really hydrates my hair). And keep using Mielle Organics protein free deep conditioner.

I've liked other DevaCurl products, but this one wasn't a ""matcha"" for me. See what I did there?I was excited to try it based on past experience and because the terminology ""melt into moisture"" and ""butter"" really spoke to me. I thought it was going to be awesome.It is green with a creamy texture, and I didn't find the scent off-putting or terribly strong. However, I felt I needed a little more of this than I do of other products to get full coverage of my fine, thin, wavy hair.I can usually get a good sense of how a conditioner or mask has performed once I rinse it, and this one didn't rinse out to leave my hair feeling silky. In fact, once I stepped out of the shower to towel-dry it, my hair was actually kind of stiff.I guess my hair looks okay after using this, but I feel like it's anything but moisturized. It honestly feels dry and a little weighed down. I'm going to use what I have and then move on to something else.

I have heard in the past that some people have issues when buying shampoo and conditioner on Amazon because it is not the same product usually found in stores. I've never had that happen, until now. I've used DevaCurl for at least two years now, and regularly purchase it at Sephora. This shampoo and conditioner smells nothing, and I mean nothing, like the exact same DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner I've purchased in the past. When my package arrived, I still had some DevaCurl conditioner remaining from my last bottle, and when smelled side-by-side, the purchase from Amazon smells like a toxic, chemical compound, meanwhile the same exact shampoo from Sephora smells fruity and citrusy. I gave the Amazon product a shot anyways, and my scalp actually felt like it was burning and itching, and I had to wash it out with my boyfriend's shampoo. Buyers beware, I will be ordering from Sephora in the future.

I received the small travel size versions of these as a gift. I was extremely enthusiastic about the prospect of taming my curls and even went to get a professional ""Deva Curl Cut"" at a local salon. My hair has been slightly bouncier after using these products in conjuction with the Arch Angel gel (as recommended by my hair dresser), however, I have not been entirely happy with these larger sized formulas. For whatever reason, my hair began to fall out in an alarmingly obvious amount after the very first use of this product. I actually had an anxiety attack and cried when I noticed my hair would not stop coming out during the shower. I waited a few days and showered again using these products and although not as much hair came out, I have noticed that my hair since using Deva Curl (travel size and this product) has resulted in my hair feeling extremely thin. When I quickly throw my hair into a pony tail I have such obvious ""bald spots"" and I find my hair is not as full or thick as it was. I am not entirely sure it is worth the money and might switch to another no-poo alternative.

Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Having my first good hair day in weeks...because I gave up on this product and went back to something else. Suspect the product may have been cut with something else, expired, or just plain fake. Did not arrive with any type of factory seal, just bit of saran wrap over the lid. The no-poo shampoo wasn't too bad, but did make my scalp itchy after the first day. It did leave my hair fairly soft and clean feeling...unforunately the conditioner left my hair feeling like straw, super dry and snarled, like I'd just used a high sulfate shampoo on it instead of conditioner. When I tried to style my hair it was crazy levels of frizzy and seemed to have trouble holding onto any type of curl.My hair is a mix of 3a and 3b curls, its big and long, but not super thick and I usually only shampoo/condition it once every 5-7 days. In between I thoroughly rewet it, rinse out most of the old styling product and add back in leave-in-conditioner and curl cream. I also usually sleep and hang out with it up in a loose bun which helps retain a lot of curl and body between styling so taking it down and fluffing it a bit still looks great. But with this product my scalp was uncomfortably itchy, my hair was far too dry, and curls too flat for this. I gave it the benefit of the doubt because the day I wash and condition my hair isn't usually its prettiest. But going back to some older products has shown me just how much of a negative difference this stuff made. Hair is still dryer than it was before I tried this stuff but at least my curls are back and the frizz is minimal.I'd like to think that this isn't Deva Curl's fault, just a fake product, as I've read all the glowing ""this stuff saved my hair"" reviews and have heard good things about this line from the curly girls I know. Was so excited to try it for myself but was amazed at how awful it made my hair look and feel. This is the second time I've purchased a fake hair product from Amazon and as much as I'd like to think that reviews like this will inspire them toward better quality control, at this point I'd say don't buy anything cosmetic here unless you already have some of the same product to compare it. Then at least you can send it back right away without damaging yourself.

This is a game changer for curly hair. Since switching to DevaCurl, my hair is healthier, bouncier, and no longer needs any product post-washing to keep the frizzies at bay. If you have naturally curly hair and don't want to deal with it, this is the shampoo and conditioner for you. I wash my hair 3 times a week and just let it air dry. The end result is soft, flowing curls that required no extra time in the bathroom to make look good.

Ok I have never written a product review before. Ever.  I have curly to wavy hair.  I have used biolage and Aveda products in the past and both have left my hair feeling simultaneously dry and heavy.  I think this is due to 1) the sulfates stripping away the natural oil produced by my scalp and 2) the paraben (wax) weighed down and straightened my curls.  I even tried to quit using shampoo altogether (gross, I know) but this left my hair greasy, and my scalp dry (dandruff).  I tried Devacurl low-poo and conditioner.  It's amazing.  My hair is clean but not dry and not weighed down....so my curls are amazing.

I've been using this product for many years since I read a book called ""Curly Girl.""  This book suggests staying completely away from shampoos containing any kind of Sodium Laureth Sulfate (often called by similar names but still bad.)  That ingredient is what causes the foaming lather we think is luxurious but that lather strips away natural oils from hair and leaves it frizzy and unmanageable.  I can always tell if I use something else = friz, dry and unmanageable!  The other really IMPORTANT thing I learned from the book is always use cool water to wash and rinse curly hair.  Using hot water can open the hair shaft and release more natural oils from your hair.  This is the ONLY product I have ever found that does NOT contain any form of Sodium Laureth Sulfate.  I love it and cannot live without it.  It seems a little pricey but you don't have to use a lot and besides...how does frizzy dry hair make you feel?  Nuff said!

I have been trying to switch over to healthier products and these were on my list to try.  I have oily hair that goes past my bra and I try to limit my shampooing to twice or three times a week.  Not possible with this.  I know there is a period of time where the oil will get worse before it got better but it never got better.  Honestly, it's like using conditioner two times instead of shampoo AND conditioner.  I am now trying to use them up and will not be repurchasing them again.Something that has done WONDERS for my hair:  I use head and shoulders on my scalp only then follow it with the deva curl shampoo all over my hair.  I then use the deva curl  conditioner only on the bottom half of my hair.  The next day my hair is EXTREMELY VOLUMINOUS and SOFT!!!

OK I have combo 3c, 4a,  4b hair that is extremely dry. I've tried every product under the sun to moisturize and define my curls. Some products worked better than others but nothing worked great. Then I heard about Deva Curls and saw all the rave reviews so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the  decadence no poo and conditioner  and heaven In hair deep conditioner. I had seen where some people leave in the conditioner, some wash it all the way out and some leave in a little.  So,  after washing with the no poo (which my hair loved)  I conditioned and washed out all but a little. Next I went on to deep condition with the heaven in hair. I had also read where some leave it in, some wash  it out  and some leave in a little.  I  didnt wash any out.  I  didn't notice any difference in my hair,  I got the same lackluster results as when I used other products so I was pretty disappointed. A few days later I decided  to give it another  try after watching a few videos and reading more reviews.  This time I used the no poo, the conditioner ( which I let sit for a few minutes)  and then COMPLETELY washed out.  I could immediately feel the difference my curls were literally forming/defining before my eyes.  I then put in the heaven in hair,  placed my hair under a cap,  wrapped a warm towel around it,  let  sit for an hour,  then I rinsed it out completely.  Wow,  is all I can say.  My curls have never been this nourished and defined!!

I typically buy Deva Curl products from my hairdresser. Since we just had a baby I wasn’t able to make it out to my salon in time to replenish my shampoo and conditioner so I bought it here. I don’t know if I received an old product or if it’s not the actual product?? ....but both the shampoo and conditioner do not smell like products I have used previously from my salon even though it claims to be the same thing. The products I received smell like old unscented lotion. Very disappointed and I will not buy again.

I have heard in the past that some people have issues when buying shampoo and conditioner on Amazon because it is not the same product usually found in stores. I've never had that happen, until now. I've used DevaCurl for at least two years now, and regularly purchase it at Sephora. This shampoo and conditioner smells nothing, and I mean nothing, like the exact same DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner I've purchased in the past. When my package arrived, I still had some DevaCurl conditioner remaining from my last bottle, and when smelled side-by-side, the purchase from Amazon smells like a toxic, chemical compound, meanwhile the same exact shampoo from Sephora smells fruity and citrusy. I gave the Amazon product a shot anyways, and my scalp actually felt like it was burning and itching, and I had to wash it out with my boyfriend's shampoo. Buyers beware, I will be ordering from Sephora in the future.

I received the small travel size versions of these as a gift. I was extremely enthusiastic about the prospect of taming my curls and even went to get a professional ""Deva Curl Cut"" at a local salon. My hair has been slightly bouncier after using these products in conjuction with the Arch Angel gel (as recommended by my hair dresser), however, I have not been entirely happy with these larger sized formulas. For whatever reason, my hair began to fall out in an alarmingly obvious amount after the very first use of this product. I actually had an anxiety attack and cried when I noticed my hair would not stop coming out during the shower. I waited a few days and showered again using these products and although not as much hair came out, I have noticed that my hair since using Deva Curl (travel size and this product) has resulted in my hair feeling extremely thin. When I quickly throw my hair into a pony tail I have such obvious ""bald spots"" and I find my hair is not as full or thick as it was. I am not entirely sure it is worth the money and might switch to another no-poo alternative.

Having my first good hair day in weeks...because I gave up on this product and went back to something else. Suspect the product may have been cut with something else, expired, or just plain fake. Did not arrive with any type of factory seal, just bit of saran wrap over the lid. The no-poo shampoo wasn't too bad, but did make my scalp itchy after the first day. It did leave my hair fairly soft and clean feeling...unforunately the conditioner left my hair feeling like straw, super dry and snarled, like I'd just used a high sulfate shampoo on it instead of conditioner. When I tried to style my hair it was crazy levels of frizzy and seemed to have trouble holding onto any type of curl.My hair is a mix of 3a and 3b curls, its big and long, but not super thick and I usually only shampoo/condition it once every 5-7 days. In between I thoroughly rewet it, rinse out most of the old styling product and add back in leave-in-conditioner and curl cream. I also usually sleep and hang out with it up in a loose bun which helps retain a lot of curl and body between styling so taking it down and fluffing it a bit still looks great. But with this product my scalp was uncomfortably itchy, my hair was far too dry, and curls too flat for this. I gave it the benefit of the doubt because the day I wash and condition my hair isn't usually its prettiest. But going back to some older products has shown me just how much of a negative difference this stuff made. Hair is still dryer than it was before I tried this stuff but at least my curls are back and the frizz is minimal.I'd like to think that this isn't Deva Curl's fault, just a fake product, as I've read all the glowing ""this stuff saved my hair"" reviews and have heard good things about this line from the curly girls I know. Was so excited to try it for myself but was amazed at how awful it made my hair look and feel. This is the second time I've purchased a fake hair product from Amazon and as much as I'd like to think that reviews like this will inspire them toward better quality control, at this point I'd say don't buy anything cosmetic here unless you already have some of the same product to compare it. Then at least you can send it back right away without damaging yourself.

This is a game changer for curly hair. Since switching to DevaCurl, my hair is healthier, bouncier, and no longer needs any product post-washing to keep the frizzies at bay. If you have naturally curly hair and don't want to deal with it, this is the shampoo and conditioner for you. I wash my hair 3 times a week and just let it air dry. The end result is soft, flowing curls that required no extra time in the bathroom to make look good.

Ok I have never written a product review before. Ever.  I have curly to wavy hair.  I have used biolage and Aveda products in the past and both have left my hair feeling simultaneously dry and heavy.  I think this is due to 1) the sulfates stripping away the natural oil produced by my scalp and 2) the paraben (wax) weighed down and straightened my curls.  I even tried to quit using shampoo altogether (gross, I know) but this left my hair greasy, and my scalp dry (dandruff).  I tried Devacurl low-poo and conditioner.  It's amazing.  My hair is clean but not dry and not weighed down....so my curls are amazing.

I've been using this product for many years since I read a book called ""Curly Girl.""  This book suggests staying completely away from shampoos containing any kind of Sodium Laureth Sulfate (often called by similar names but still bad.)  That ingredient is what causes the foaming lather we think is luxurious but that lather strips away natural oils from hair and leaves it frizzy and unmanageable.  I can always tell if I use something else = friz, dry and unmanageable!  The other really IMPORTANT thing I learned from the book is always use cool water to wash and rinse curly hair.  Using hot water can open the hair shaft and release more natural oils from your hair.  This is the ONLY product I have ever found that does NOT contain any form of Sodium Laureth Sulfate.  I love it and cannot live without it.  It seems a little pricey but you don't have to use a lot and besides...how does frizzy dry hair make you feel?  Nuff said!

Wow. I have no words for how amazing this is for my curly hair. Never EVER going back. Deva curl user for life. I used the no poo and the one C onditoner followed by the light gel. Best hair product I have ever come across. 5 stars. If you have curly hair order this, no doubt will change your life like it did for mine. I watched a deva curl videos for how to do it and the girls come out perfect every time. Ordering large size right now!!!!!!!!!!!! Totally brought my curls back to live and thriving and shiny and soft. Just Wow!

I have been trying to switch over to healthier products and these were on my list to try.  I have oily hair that goes past my bra and I try to limit my shampooing to twice or three times a week.  Not possible with this.  I know there is a period of time where the oil will get worse before it got better but it never got better.  Honestly, it's like using conditioner two times instead of shampoo AND conditioner.  I am now trying to use them up and will not be repurchasing them again.Something that has done WONDERS for my hair:  I use head and shoulders on my scalp only then follow it with the deva curl shampoo all over my hair.  I then use the deva curl  conditioner only on the bottom half of my hair.  The next day my hair is EXTREMELY VOLUMINOUS and SOFT!!!

Ordered this as a suggestion for a friend.  I'm rather pleased with it.  I'm mixed and regular shampoo/conditioner just leaves my hair frizzy and uncontrollable. This makes my hair easy to comb and they settle perfectly!  The no poo doesn't lather and its weird to get used to in the beginning but goddess cleans very nicely, and the conditioner smells a little like dog wash but overall i love it and would recommend.

I purchased this after learning of this companies' excellent quality and dedication to hair care without the harmful chemicals. I absolutely love this product. Excellent packaging and smells great! However, I highly recommend taking DevaCurl's Curl Quiz before purchasing. DevaCurl Low-Poo is designed for curly hair, which tends to require more moisture than wavy hair (like mine!). While I love using this product on my hair, I know the Low-Poo Delight would suit my hair better as it provides weightless moisture which is what my hair really needs. Also after reading more about the product on their website I cannot stress enough the importance of massaging the shampoo into the scalp to properly clean! Massaging is also important to properly remove the shampoo while rinsing.Overall great product that I would purchase again!

I was skeptical at first about the product...I had to do a lot of researching before going with it, but I'm so glad I did! My hair is so curly and full of volume and NOTHING seems to work for it, but then I stumbled onto this gem of a line of products and im soooo IN LOVE with all of it!!

I got this originally as a sample in a much smaller size as a sample ans paid this much so the price alone is AMAZING!!!I was nervous because some other reviews said they received fake product when they ordered from amazon, but tgis is the real deal. I have been using heat to straighten and/or curl my hair for years so my natural curls were not so happy... but to my surprise after the first wash I had some nice body & curl showing & it has just continued to improve from there. If you are on the fence about this GO FOR IT it is 110% worth it!
"

Like some of deva curls products but feel they are way to over priced for the amount you get. If you have very think I mean very thick curly hair, forgot it! You’ll go through this very fast. I didn’t like the cream shampoo AT ALL!! Who came up with that one? Oh right, some one who failed chemistry and was on crack in the lab... it’s awful! Doesn’t feel like your hair is getting cleaned & had to use so much at a time. If you have thin hair maybe it works different? I don’t recommend this, so not worth the money, won’t but this again.

I've only used this for 3 days so far, but so far so good.  I kept trying other non-toxic products and my hair was getting really tangled and starting to get dry and brittle.  I'm in my early 40s and have fine medium length hair.  It used to be straight, but about a year ago, I noticed it had turned a little wavy, so I stopped blow-drying and straightening it.  It's easy for my hair to dry out and for the waves to look dull.  This set had already improved them moisture and health of my hair and I don't have the horrible tangles anymore.  Time will tell if I continue to like it, but so far I love it.  The scent is not overpowering and is pretty nice and clean smelling.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
This set had a weird smell to it, but I tried it anyway as it is Devacurl and an expensive product line, and I didn't want to waste my money. After a week of using it, ONLY 3 days of actual use, my scalp became very itchy and was caked with a white film. Coincidently, thousands of women online and within the curly hair community are claiming that Devacurl products are ruining their curls and their hair is falling out in clumps (thankful this did not happen to me) and they too have itchy, irritable scalps. I would recommend anyone looking to buy the Devacurl products from any vendor to wait as the company is undergoing quality control. In the meantime, I switched to Neutrogena's Anti-residue shampoo to remove the build up from my scalp and will be trying Carol's Daughters' line of curl products. Plus, once opened, this is nonrefundable and I'm out $40. Bummer!

My hair had lost all of its curls after years of flat ironing it. Basically, I'd describe it as just puffy/frizzy/wavy. After using this product twice, I can't say it's Aaamazing but it has helped my hair get some of the curls back. You can definitely see the curls start to get their bounce back and I really like it. It got rid of most and the frizz and now I'd describe my hair as a curly afro that I'd definitely rock in the outside world. It smells nice in my opinion, kinda like menthol? Idk. Mine came with a styling cream that smells like skittles.

It says this is supposed to smell good, but every time I use it my boyfriend complains that my hair smells like chemicals. This is my first time using this product, so I don't know if this is how its supposed to smell, but he has complained so many times that I am switching to something else. It also makes my thin, fine hair look greasy, even if I rinse out the conditioner thoroughly with cold water. I'm disappointed.

This product is the best for curls. I have been battling regaining my curls from years of damage by flat ironing. I have tried several different products that didn't to be any results. After one wash I saw a huge difference and after continous use my curls are finally back. Your hair feels light and healthy. Highly recommend this product along with the defining gel.

This product is amazing! Sulfate free, and as I learned on Netflix's ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"", fewer suds equals healthier hair. I also purchased the conditioner and a hair serum by a brand named Herstyler on the recommendation of a friend with lovely, shiny curls. I will never return to my drug store shampoos! This is so much gentler on my normally thick and frizzy hairvthat I see a difference after only 3 washings. Will definately be reordering!

Eh. I guess I am unimpressed with the whole Deva Curl experience. I had a cut this summer, and it was terrible. I had to cut it again myself at home. I decided to finally give the product a try, and both times I've used it I find my hair feeling dry and in unremarkable condition. Big disappointment for me and my curly hair. I am willing to pay for a good product that will pamper my natural hair, and this is not it.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I have been using the shampoo and conditioner on and off for a while now and I really do like the way it makes my curls feel hydrated and takes away the frizz. I didn’t notice a difference right away, took some time and also I use a leave in condotioner now so that helps a lot too. The shampoo itself does not leather but I can tell it’s still getting my hair clean and therefore doing its job. The conditioner is not a deep conditioner so don’t expect it to be super smooth and slippery, it is just a regular conditioner in my opinion.It smells really great, I would say the shampoo is like a rose scent and the conditioner is definitely a gardenia scent, so both are very floral but also fresh. It’s not overwhelming.I gave it four stars because I was not a huge fan of the conditioner being just a regular conditioner. I feel that it should be a little deeper considering it’s for curly hair.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I actually didn't like either product at all. They made my curly hair frizzier and  it felt drier unless i left the conditioner in. So I wouldn't purchase again. I have crazy kinky curls, super thick hair. I was very underwhelmed with this product and wanted to like it so bad! It worked better on my little sisters finer curls, but still not worth the money in my opinion. Pretty bummed because I really wanted to like it.

I have thick, curly hair and I had a love/hate relationship with my curls until I started using Devacurl products two years ago. Before Devacurl, I would frequently have bad hair days where my hair was flat or frizzy. Now, I rarely have bad hair days and my curls are bouncy and shiny. I also use a deep conditioner at least once a week and I use the Devacurl styling products, but these are my go to shampoo and conditioner. They're a little pricey, but these bottles last me 6 months or more because a little goes a long way.

I have coarse, auburn, loose curly hair, and this is the only shampoo/conditioner combo that I can honestly say makes a difference. My curls are so much more predictable, soft and healthy. I only wash my hair about once a week, and the frizz is all but gone (I live in Atlanta, too). I pair it with their light gel which is not crunchy at all. Love the scant. Buying the huge bottles next time.

I have been having an itchy, irritated, flaky and sometimes burning scalp and have had a lot of hair loss. I attributed it to winter, anxiety or just plain old aging. Unfortunately it’s all due to Devacurl. I didn’t have this trouble with the last bottle I bought but this specific one I have. Will not be using Devacurl products in the future.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I really wanted to like this shampoo and conditioner but I can’t.  It leaves my hair feeling greasy.  I haven’t used a brush on my hair in years as I usually just run my fingers through it when I condition, but I have found tangles and knots after using these products. I had planned on using them for at least a few weeks to give them a chance, but cannot.  Supermarket brands seems to work better than this one. I hope you have better luck.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I am loving the way my hair is turning out after using these. The Low-Poo smells awesome to me and I love that my hair isn't dried out after. I will be moving to the No-Poo after this bottle is done though. Not because it does not work, but because the DC professionals have stated that for thirsty hair the No-Poo is better. The One conditioner is a dream. I love using it as my leave in. For now I am using up my Mixed Chicks deep Co so DC One Co is my leave in after my detangling. But I will not have a problem switching to using the One Co for all my detangling needs later.

I have been using this shampoo on my hair for years now. The conditioner helps things from drying out, and everyone always tells me that my hair smells wonderful. So, it totally works.I used to hate taking care of my hair because no one else in my immediate family has curly hair,  and they would give me terrible advice, or be disapproving.

I was sceptical trying these products, I had tried the wavemaker in the past and I wasn't a fan. Along with these products I tried the ultra defining gel, it's day 2 now and I'm thrilled with the results. I have 2c wavy hair that's usually out of control once it reaches past my shoulders (think Natasha Lyonne from Orange is the New black.) This stuff smoothed my hair out and when I added in the gel I got nice defined waves. Hopefully it continues to work so I don't have to cut it short again!

The place next to my home quit selling it so I came to Amazon. I am impressed. It's the real deal. Shipped perfectly. No leaks or spills. My hair is so happy again. I wash my hair every day too.

I used Deva Curl Products since August 2019.  My hair began to fall out during using Deva Curl Products.  Thinking it was age or hormones I did not relate the hair loss to the Deva Curl product until a few weeks ago when I became aware of the hair loss issue with MULTIPLE people.  I've stopped using this product and I strongly suggest you do also.  There is a class action law suit being formed over Deva Curl products.

I bought this shampoo because regular shampoo leaves my hair too freezy. Co washing leaves my hair too greasy after a time so I thought this low poo shampoo was the key. It was not. The shampoo doesn’t clean my hair at all. It left it stiff and greasy feeling after using it for 2 weeks. It was difficult to detangle with my fingers after a time due to the greasiness. Smells weird too. The conditioner is ok hence the 2 stars. I have wavy/curly hair

If you have even a slight curl in your hair, buy this!!! My hair has always been wavy/frizzy/curly, and after literally the first use of this, my hair was light and perfectly curled even by air drying!!! You will never regret the money spent on a good shampoo and conditioner.

So far so good! For the first time since I was a toddler I have good curls! Barely any frizz and I live in a high humidity area. For the first time in many years I am enjoying letting my hair down during the summer and for the first time my hair looks good air dried. Product does arrive in a plastic bottle that is recyclable but would like to see product switched to a glass bottle to be more eco friendly.

My curls look great!! Everybody wants to know what i use to make them look so curly!!

The product is great for my hair, but the smell makes me not want to use it

I have wavy 2B hair type. Bought the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo was so smelly that I couldn't use it. It smells like old lady fake roses and the smell lasted days. I continued to use the conditioner (btw smells like sunblock). The conditioner is just okay. Doesn't seem to do anything special for my hair. I'm using it with Surface Curls shampoo. I shampoo only once a week and condition at least twice a week. I won't be buying Devacurl again.

I first experienced this stuff when at a curly-hair-centric salon in Minneapolis. The shampoo somehow cleans your hair without stripping the oils from it. It's magic, I don't know. And a little bit of the conditioner goes a long way. And they both smell heavenly, and make my hair clean and shiny like no other shampoo or conditioner ever have. For ladies with curly hair, there is no better product line under the sun as far as I know.

Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Do not buy this product. It caused a huge hair loss for me as many other costumes here. SO disappointed. I cried in the shower as I could not believe that disaster. I hope they fix the formula, it did not work well with California water on my hair .
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I loved it! Made my hair soft and my curls poppin! Not to expensive but still got to try the products out to see if I wanted the full size. Lasted me (3c thick hair) about 2-3 weeks. I’m switching over to deva fully. And I’ve used deva in the past but I just can never get over how good it makes my hair look and feel. The smell and moisture are an added bonus !
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
The best cleanser for naturally curly/wavy hair ever! It's like a miracle for my dry/curly! Tends-to- frizz hair. I love it! My hair actually shines again!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I love this stuff! My hair is so different (in a good way) since I stopped using sulfates and silicone. Finally I have an easy curly hairdo in 10 minutes!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I was so disappointed when I decided to splurge on this shampoo and it arrived with 1/4 of the shampoo leaked all over the package. 🤦‍♀️

My granddaughter (12) loves this shampoo and conditioner.  She has mixed ethnic hair and this really controls it.  She gets compliments all the time.

Beat shampoo I’ve ever used hands down. Don’t be alarmed that there are no suds, it cleans your hair wonderfully.

I love this product, but the no-poo original conditioning cleanser came completely broken. The package arrived today and, as you can see, the top is literally broken so there will definitely be some difficulty using it now. Like the headline says I love this product but I will not be purchasing from this seller again because I'm not even sure how you break a bottle cap like this.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Love this product! Where was this curly hair technology when I was growing up? Has made a huge difference in my curly hair. I use a lot less product.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
My sister has used this for years and her hair looks great. Borrowed some from her and it made my curly frizzy hair feel great and tamed the frizz. With all the products I've used over the years, this is the best.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I love this stuff! I've had problems with my hair smelling every now and again due to a product build up that can happen with different products (mostly the fake stuff that promotes smooth and sleek hair) but this stuff fixed that as well as conditioning and not being tough on my hair. P.s I have purple hair and does not strip the color as fast as other products do. Always come back for more!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
It made my hair very nice and curly, but I had so much hair fallout that it was concerning. After my first time using it, I figured it was because it was a new product  and my hair wasn’t used to it. But the same thing happened when I started it again for a second time. The costs outweighs the benefit.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
So far I’ve only used the cleanser once and the daily leave in twice. But beforehand I was thinking about cutting my hair due to heat damage which I thought had take the entire front half of my hair. Upon using these products, it appears that a much smaller section of my hair is heat damaged and it seems a lot more likely that I can just grow it out
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
It doesn't work as well as the hype made it sound. My hair is waist length and thick. I have to use sooooo much to manage my hair. I have to use at least 2 handfuls each time. I found another brand that works better for me uses half as much and literally costs a third as much.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
My product arrived damaged.  The cap was broken and a lot of the content spilled.  Disappointing.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Dried out my hair after several uses. Worked fairly well to control my frizz at first then my hair became dry after several uses. Maybe just not for my hair type
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I have very curly, frizzy hair. I live in a humid climate which makes it worse. I think this works well only if you use the gel or B’Leave In Miracle plumper along with it.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
This is the most amazing shampoo and conditioner for curls. And it doesn’t harm my color.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
New to product line. Love the smell. Light, fruity. Shampoe does not foam up - must wet hair thourouly before applying. Love how it revitalizes my fine cury hair leaving soft and cury...no frizz. Hurray!!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I DID NOT receive this item for free or a discount. I hate that Amazon does that because I do not feel that the feedback is reliable. Knowing that I have decided to sit down an write feedback for every item I have bought as I read all feed back before buying and do not feel most is truthful.Works great on my daughters curls.  Would purchase again.
"

I have been on ""no poo"" regiment of baking soda and apple cider vinegar for 6 years now. This is the first shampoo I've been able to use regularly without getting dryness, itching, and flaking from my scalp.

Perfect for my 3A curls.  I pair this with  DevaCurl Wavemaker, following the curly girl method, and my curls have finally returned!
"

I do like this but I am not inlove.  I probably will not get the no poo again, as I can just use a conditioner.  The conditioner could moisturize better, but it does get the job done.

Stuff is pretty good it makes my curly hair soft I guess.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I have been buying this product for months now love it . I have thick curly hair  the shampo doesn't lather away your hair color . You use a lot more shampo then conditioner , it used to be the other way around with other brands .
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I love this conditioner!  I do the Girly Curl method so use this to ""wash"" my hair as well as a leave in conditioner. My hair looks (and smells) great!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Leaves my hair super soft and moisturized. it is no doubt a great shampoo and conditioner. It's very lightweight and I have thin hair, so I like the fact that it doesn't weigh my hair down.

I read so many reviews and heard great things about it so thought I'd give it a try. I was so disappointed!! Gave it two weeks. My hair was thinned out and got tangled and broke easily. I noticed more hair loss than usual and no shine.I've since switched and 3 days in, my hair looks and feels better.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
The cleanliness is amazing. Not really much of a scent but I don't mind that as long as the product does what it'claims to do.

My daughter will now ONLY use the Low-Poo! After years of trying new products on her natural hair, we stumbled across this. She uses it weekly and loves it. We have purchased twice now and I believe this will be a staple for a long time.

Deva curls just did not work the way we thought it would for our daughters thick curly hair, actually felt lie it made her hair worst, left a nasty gunk in her hair

I like the shampoo & conditioner of DevaCurl. However it came unsealed and the shampoo smelled like gum. I wanted to return it but since I had already started using I did not. High possibility of not being genuine.

Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I have very unruly curly hair and turned to devacurl to revitalize,  however, after using for over one month the only difference I noticed in my hair was that it didn't feel clean.  I do love their styling products though, but I will stick to mane and tail for shampooing and conditioning.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
The shampoo smelled like there was ammonia in it. It faded my color faster than any other product I have used. I also ended up with some type of reaction, dandruff and a rash on my ear and neck. My hair is also falling out in clumps.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Before I started using this my hair was dry and had alot of split ends I've been using since December I haven't yet bought a curl plumper or a monster lock in but  I Definitely will be using this product 💝💝💝

These products were a very big disappointment. Although I used them according to directions, they left my hair slimy, weighted down ,and unattractive. They were a big waste of money, and I would like a complete refund. Thank you.

Fantastic!My curls are are smooth and shineNo frizzies. I love it !!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Although it does say ""low-poo"" on the bottle it was not. I've tried the ""low-poo"" before and it smells citrusy kind of like oranges and has an orange tint to it. The shampoo I received had more of a flowery chemical smell and was very light almost having no color. I'm guessing I received the ""no-poo"". I mainly purchased to get the ""one condition"" but I would've like to receive what I ordered.
"

"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
This product is fake. I expected the conditioner to be smooth and feel like lotion, as I've seen in reviews, but it was extremely crispy and hard. Plus, it's nearly impossible to squeeze out of the bottle and doesn't feel good on my hair. Don't buy from this specific seller!

Smells good, leaves hair shiny, conditioner works well. Using it for a girl with hairs ligthly curled.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I love this shampoo. It is the best one that I have found for my hair. My hair is thin and very dry, but the roots get oily so I have to wash it everyday. This is gentle enough to use everyday and its the only shampoo that I have used that has made my hair soft. I shower before bed at night, and sometimes when I wake up in the morning my curls are shiny and detangled, so I don't have to do anything to them, and even when its not perfect, all I have to do is comb it with my fingers. It smells OK and gives my hair volume without drying it out.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Great product, keeps my curly style frizz free all day.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
This stuff smells SO bad. When I first opened it, it smelled similar to dog flea medication - but I genuinely think it's worse than that. It just smells like medicine. Not only does it smell terrible, it made my hair so frizzy. My curls both smelled bad and looked awful. Would NOT recommend to anyone.
"

Not near as moisturing as the original deva curl products. Disappointed.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I bought this product because I've heard so many great things about the devacurl line. I was highly impressed by the amount of slippage the conditioner and cleanser provided. I sectioned off my hair and finger detangled my hair in the shower as well as used a wide tooth comb. Afterwards I used my own leave in conditioner while my hair was still soaking wet. I used cantu Shea butter line with Argan oil. This is a great product and I will be trying out more of the devacurl products !

I wish I never purchased this shampoo and conditioner! The first few washes, my hair was great, but after about two weeks my hair became flat and felt awful. My scalp became very dry and flaky and I noticed I was losing more hair than normal. I went back to my previous shampoo and conditioner (Giovanni) and my hair is healthy and flake free again.This hair product may work well for others, but not for me!

I'm really not sure what the hype is all about. The shampoo and conditioner have a really strong scent. And both left my hair feeling really dry.  I would never flat iron my hair after using these products, as my hair felt too brittle to take anything like that.After trying out several shampoos and conditioners, I found Aveda's damage care line to be the best on my naturally curly hair.

It's still early days for me with this product. But I've definitely seen improvements in the last 2 weeks. My curls were so dry it hurt to touch. The first thing I noticed was just how much softer and shinier they got after 2 washes. I used the Devacurl gel along with it. If there's any drawback it's that I feel like I need to use more product, but maybe that's just me getting used to a no poo method. Definitely sticking with this for the next 6months.

I was in the fence about buying this for months and finally did it.  I was not impressed with the performance of this product. If anything, my hair was more frizzy. I used it for a solid month and even used the microfiber towel with it.The no-poo aspect wasn't as wierd as I thought it was going to be though. My hair was always clean after using it. Going back to my Loreal product!

I love these products.  Having a non-lathering shampoo has been an adjustment but I like the results.  I think I need to get a certified ""Deva Curl"" haircut to maximize the benefit of this product line.  I still have some curls that don't commit into curls, I'm not sure if that is hair texture, technique or the need for a new style.

Can't say enough about Deva Curl. Took a while because I thought it was a little expensive so I bought everything else under the sun spending hundreds by the time it was all said in done. One day I tried a new stylist and she recommend Deva Curl form my texture (3c and really thick in the crown). She did a finger style with the additional DC products and I loved it. My new staple products.

Let me preface by saying I did not buy this product off of amazon. I bought it at my local Bed, Bath and Beyond, but wanted to share my review so that others wouldn't have to make the same mistake.I used the No-Poo and Conditioner all of 3 times and each time I noticed each time more and more hair falling out. I always shed hair in the shower, but this was and excessive amount compared to usual not to mention the dozens of hairs I lose throughout the day. I don't trust it which is sad because it made my curls look fantastic, but so not worth going bald for fantastic curls. Avoid this product if you want to keep your hair on your head.

As most curly girls can agree, we’ve tried everything.  I know I have.  I’ve wasted so much money on products and have had to throw them away because they flat out, don’t work.  I started using Deva Curl Products a few years ago and although I occasionally switch to another brand due to the cost, I always come back to DEVA.  Like every great love, I come crawling back, BECAUSE IT’S THE ONE!  Both the no-poo and conditioner actually moisturize the hair shaft, instead of coating the hair in silicone giving the illusion of moisture( like other brands).  Sometimes, I don’t even need to use styling product because my hair is so soft and moisturized from this line.  If you have dry, damaged or course hair, I highly recommend this line of products.

Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Perfect for our 4A-4C Family!  I use the DevaCurl Shampoo and Conditioner, then KinkyCurly Leave In for 4A hair.  I use the same shampoo and conditioner, but then Shea Moisture Low-Porosity Leave In for our 4B/C curly heads.  You can feel the moisturizing process even starting with the shampoo.  It is mild enough to use several days a week with gym and swimming workouts.  I find that it works better to use the shampoo and conditioner every time.  No need to co-wash with conditioner with this ladies--the results are better using both together.  We get clean, soft, shiny, curly defined hair every time.

I love this product, it has done WONDERS for my hair. I have fine hair that my grandmother once described as ""bendy""--as in it will shape itself around something, like my ear or a hair tie or clip, but generally hung almost straight. I've had a lot of trouble finding a shampoo and conditioner that will moisturizer my hair without leaving it oily, and will clean it well without drying out my scalp and my hair. This is the stuff. Not only does my hair better follow its natural wavy tendencies now that it has proper nutrition, it also doesn't need to be washed every day. It's shiny and sleek and wavy and my scalp is not dry or itchy. I can go at least a day without washing it and it still looks fine, just toss it in a bun for the day and I'm off! It smells interesting, especially the conditioner--the grape seed oil is pretty apparent, but it definitely doesn't smell bad, just unusual. Only things I don't like are the cost and the fact that you have to use a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean. However, since I don't have to wash it every day, I think it equals out. There is a learning curve as far as how much to use, and I found that I had to be careful not to miss a spot or else it wouldn't get clean because it doesn't lather. Once I figured out that having your hair really wet before starting to shampoo helps, I was golden. Great product, definitely going to stick with it.

I really wanted to like this stuff, and used an entire bottle of it, using it exclusively, over the last couple months before writing this review. I have a thick head of fine, armpit-length hair that makes 'shirley temple' ringlets (or looser), and I also have bangs. My favorite shampoo/conditioner is Davines 'love' purple smoothing shampoo and conditioner, which runs about twice the price as Devacurl. I then style with redken's frizz dismiss oil and curvaceous full swirl, or ouai wave spray. So I'm picky about my hair. Unfortunately, this product doesn't live up to my expectations. I'm sure 'no lather' works great for a lot of people and I really tried to give it a go and even got used to the sensation of scrubbing sans bubbles, but my bangs were stringy, limp, and greasy as soon as they dried, no matter how much dry shampoo or gel I put in them. The conditioner also weighed down my hair, and still unfortunately wasn't enough to keep frizz from lifting from my curls throughout the day- at least, not compared to my normal routine of basically masking my hair every time I wash it. I definitely agree that this stuff is miles better for curls than any basic shampoo, but it's back to Davines for me.

Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I bought the travel size as a trial size before committing to the full size bottles. I absolutely love the NoPoo shampoo. It got my hair clean without making it squeaky. It felt really good to not have the lather getting in the way, this way I could more accurately feel where I had really cleaned my hair and scalp, resulting in a more thorough cleaning. In comparison, I accidentally bought the LowPoo shampoo version, and haaaaate that one as it does lather (more than a little) and I found I just cant get my hair as clean with it.The conditioner — well, it’s fine. I havent found it to be especially remarkable when compared to other similar, cheaper, conditioners (Shea Moisture is maybe $6 and does just as well).Both shampoo and conditioner do have a bit of a chemical, hair salon type smell to them. I thought this would bother me as I am generally sensitive to strong smells, but I am relieved to find that this has not been a problem with these products.Overall, I love the NoPoo and highly recommend it. The conditioner isnt bad, but I recommend a cheaper option.

Absolutely a huge fan! I honestly did a lot of research before I order these products. Be careful that you’re getting the actual diva curl brand and not knock off brand. I would pick the Amazon choice and not an alternate buy absolutely a huge fan! I honestly did a lot of research before I order these products. Be careful that you’re getting the actual diva curl brand and not knock off brand. I would pick the Amazon choice and not an alternate seller  to try and save money. The products are absolutely worth the price. My hair was so damaged that my curls were just frizzy straw. The first week I used the product I kept waiting to go bald or something because it felt too good to be true. I’ve now been using these products for a little over two months.  I barely put anything in my hair anymore.  It feels so healthy and my curls are looking great! You should still do some research on which products will best fit your hair type. If you already have very healthy hair I wouldn’t recommend any of the styling products. Just the shampoo (No-poo). You could Overland your hair with protein and make it stringy and unpleasant.

I live in a high desert, extremely dry environment, not a good climate for girls with curls.  I wanted a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but this product is heavy, like working lotion into your hair and rinsing it out.  Not a good look for fine hair.  If your hair is course and curly, this might be a good product for you.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I used to love Deva products, and while it's true that they're good for bouncy curls, they're not great for scalp health. After a few months of use I had a lot of flakes. At first I thought it was the Deva gel having dried out but quickly narrowed it down to the shampoo. When you look this up online you can see that a lot of people complain that the No-Poo causes flakes/dandruff. I then found some success limiting my use of the no-poo to no more than once per week, for special occasions or when I wanted my curls to look their best. I've now stopped using it entirely as I prefer to have a healthy, flake-free scalp.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I have been using this for several weeks and am extremely disappointed in the conditioner. It smells like it has gone bad and nothing like the actual conditioner. It’s scent is heavy in chemicals and very bland. Nothing like the fresh, minty smell the actual product should exude. It also leaves a lot of nasty build up on my hair. I can’t seem to find a link to contact the seller via Amazon, and when I called DevaCurl’s main line, they refused to help. I definitely discourage anyone from purchasing this product because I do not think you will receive what you think you are purchasing.

I have been trying everything ever since Aveda reformulated their shampoo into something unusable for me.  Curly haired people know how difficult it is to find the right product.  I'm now using this combo, and it is working for me.  I like the low-poo better than the no-poo.  It is not drying, and it leaves my curls soft and spirally. The conditioner is also good as a leave-in, and only a tiny bit is needed.  Best tip ever for curly hair:  do not dry with a terri towel, use cotton knit (like a tee shirt) - makes huge difference in preventing frizz.

I'm a devotee. There's nothing better (for my curly hair, at least) than Deva Care hair products.  I've tried everything, & as a baby boomer, I have many years of trying(!), & hands down, Deva No Poo, conditioners, light gel for after washing/conditioning--just do the trick.No additives, smell wonderful, created by Lorraine Massey, a curly girl herself, & price is right on Amazon.Simplified my life--no need to be tempted by other hair products anymore, yea!👍🏼

A little pricey, but my curls are loving it!  Got after asking for a recommendation from someone with beautiful natural curls.  Watched the YouTube video on how to make it work,  bought the sample size kit, and wow!  Amazing curls that I can finally love.  Wish I had found these products years ago!

I was so surprised how well my hair responded to these products.  After a recent highlight my hair became frizzy and now I have defined curls.  I followed the directions and found it a bit heavy (since my curls are probably cherub) so I use it my way and it works well:  wash with ""no poo"", conditioner and comb with a wide tooth, lightly rinse, followed by the light hold gel, the Deva curl microfiber towel and then let the curls dry naturally.  I even made a spray mister with 1/2 water and 1/2 conditioner and use it to revitalize my curls on the second and third day.

I have been using Deva products for more than a dozen years now and I find that the No Poo and One Condition are still my favorite go to shampoo and conditioner.  I do find that the No Poo weighs down my combination hair during the winter months so I usually switch it out for the Lo Poo until the spring.  If you have dry hair, then this would work for you year round.

This product has worked amazing on my wavy/curly hair! I also starting using the gel, foam, and clips to dry -and my hair seems to get better everytime I use it! I am 38 years old and literally just learned how to finally take care of my hair- I thought I’f you had frizzy hair that wasn’t super curly- heat was the only option. I had no idea that using the right product - and basically leaving it alone made nice frizz free curls

I don't have naturally curly hair. I do get perms though. I usually have to get a perm once every 6 weeks for it to look nice. But after using deva curl, I haven't had to get one yet and it's been 8 months. However, I prefer the no-poo over the low-poo. I feel like the low-poo makes my hair oily faster and I don't know why.

This isn't the kind of product where you use it once and instantly fall in love. It takes commitment to using it for two weeks straight. Once your hair has had time to adjust to the product, then you will fall in love with it.

I have mixed feelings about these products but they are mostly positive. I have a mix of 2c, 3a, and 3b hair that is fine and fairly porous. Using this every day, my hair got rather dry and frizzy but with a little experimenting, I've figured out how to use these products to suit my needs.LOW-POO: Love the low-poo!! It gets my hair squeaky clean but also moisturizes and detangles really well. My hair is SO soft after using this, even before I use conditioner. I massage it into my roots in sections. I do use quite a bit, as the bubbles don't ""spread"" as easily as traditional shampoos. However, (as described in my routine below) I only use this every few days so it still lasts me a long time (from August to December thus far).ONE CONDITION: I think One Condition is not moisturizing enough for my hair. However, One Condition works GREAT as a co-wash (I think the glycerin helps with this). I ended up buying a different, heavier conditioner to add to my routine. Here's what I do now. Day 1: Low-poo + heavy conditioner. Day 2-4: Co-wash with One Condition + heavy conditioner. Repeat! My hair is now super soft, shiny, healthy, and frizz-free. Woohoo!!Overall, I would definitely purchase the Low-poo again (although there are cheaper sulfate-free options out there). However, I don't think One Condition is worth it for me as it is pretty expensive, and I go through it too quickly using it as a co-wash almost everyday. I now buy a cheaper light conditioner for my co-washing needs and spend more money on a good heavy conditioner instead.

I have heard such rave reviews about this product that I finally splurged when I got a gift card for Christmas.  I am not as happy with either product. It cleans my hair well but I need a better conditioner.  My curly hair doesn't seem any more manageable (or curly) than when I am using my organic sulfate free products from the natural store.  Probably won't re-purchase.  I may try another set from their line as maybe my curls just need more moisture.

I wanted to try this product and I have gotten 4 washes and still have more product.  Just ordered the larger sizes.  Love them and what they do for my curly wavy fine hair.

If you haven't found a deva trained stylist, do it. Curly hair needs special treatment. My daughter struggled for years with frizz and this stuff actually works. Especially if you get a good cut and get shown what not to do with curly hair.

I bought this for my daughter upon recommendation of a friend with curly hair. I went on YouTube for instructions on use of products. I saw a real difference in my daughter's hair in about a week. She is falling in love with her hair for the first time.

Great for my 4a/4b textured, dry hair. Conditioner is awesome as rinse out, leave in, and detangler. Pricey, but quality product. I find myself reaching for DevaCurl the Most.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Be careful. I don't think this product is authentic. It has a much different texture than the devacurl products purchased from devacurl and does not work as well. I learned my lesson and will be spending a little extra money to buy from licensed/reputable sources or directly from DevaCurl from now on.

My husband has course curly hair. He says this is the product he has been looking for his whole life. I have noticed his curls are more healthy looking and shiny when he uses this. It just so unfortunately expensive.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
It seems to work great. My hairdresser recommended this product to bring out fhe curls I didn’t know I had. It is a little on the pricey side though.
"

Was super excited to try this set based on reviews and didnt feel that they were worth the price. Ive seen better results with suave professionals than this! Highly recommend the tigi catwalk curl boosting set
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Have used ""no-poo"" in the past. This is a ""low-pow"", so I believe it has some shampoo. Really helps dry hair. Do need the curl gel to put in your hair after, if you want to hold in curls.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
My hairdresser recommended that I get to use for my new perm. They have work so well! My curls are now defined and never frizzy, they bounce better, and the volume is great. I really recommend this for anyone with curly hair
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I loved the shampoo. I was losing handfuls of hair everyday using my old shampoo. I began using this shampoo and noticed a huge difference the first day. I have been using it a couple of weeks now and barely lose hair and it doesn't dry my hair out. I will definitely purchase the shampoo again. The conditioner is ok and probably won't purchase it again.

"

Didn't see much difference in this product. Quite expensive for something that I did not notice was better than other products I prefer that are cheaper. Will not purchase this item again :(

I like the deva products in general. I try others but keep going back to this brand. I have 3b-c curls and the system keeps the frizz down and the style in check during humid georgia wheather.

Fantastic product!  This product doesn't foam up so no buildup in your hair. The clean and softness you'll get is amazing.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Works great on my curly gray hair. Friends think I actually work on my hair and that I have “great hair.”  Ha!  I just want hair instead of cotton candy or dryer lint—my norm. Little effort, works great.
"

I ordered this product because at work a bottle broke and it smelled amazing ,this one I received stinks so I am returning it. I hate this because i really looked forward to trying it.has anyone else had this experience? I think I got a fake product.
"

Great product for my grandsons. Doesn't strip the hair of natural oils.  Helps loose soft curls!!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
This shampoo (and conditioner) has been amazing! I am in the process of growing out my hair after two years of serious, unexplainable hair loss after my last pregnancy. I have tried a ton of products but this one has brought my curly (thin) hair back to life! It is worth the money! I love it!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
This stuff is wonderful for my dry curly hair. The shampoo alone really softens and smooths my hair. I use a clarifying shampoo to remove my product from my hair and then immediately follow up with my no poo decadence. No need for me to use detangling spray!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Didn’t do anything for my hair and the smell is chemical. My roots looked greasy and my ends were dry
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Love the product, hate the bottles.  I have to take the tops off in order to get anything to come out. Your first squeeze makes a dent in the bottle and the solutions refuse to come out even with shaking.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I’m not sure about this product, to me the smell of the product was off. My husband even commented on how it smelled like perm solution.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Use on very dry hair.  It was not harsh and did not strip the hair or remove moisture.  Very good product for natural hair.

"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I've used this before and loved it. Bought the combo, the conditioner did not smell at all like the original. I still had the small size and smelled both, there is no way these are the same thing. I tried using it, and my hair doesn't feel the same. I do not honk the shampoo is original, but not the conditioner.
"

"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I have mostly straight hair with a bit of wave and a combo of dry and oily scalp. After one washing this cleanser and conditioner have made my hair soft, full, and generally amazing. My only wish is it wasn't so fragrant. I don't like how my hair still smells so strongly of the product.

The ""no-poo"" feels more like a conditioner. It leaves my hair even greasier than it was before ""washing"" it. The conditioner is awesome and I love it.

"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I have used these products for over 3 years & they work great on my super curly hair. They smell good & work great. What I received in this order smelled terrible, was awful on my hair and wasn't even the right color in the bottle. Extremely disappointed.

Love these products. Conditioner has a strong scent. Nice but better for a woman than a man
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I love this product; however, the second bottle of conditioner that I received seemed much thicker than the first.  I had to take the cover off to use it as it wouldn't go through the cap hole.  I recommended the product to a friend and she told me she liked the shampoo, but didn't like the conditioner as it was thick and gave her hair a heavy feel.  Did they change the formula?
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
The shampoo smells like Windex. The conditioner smells a generic bar of soap and cheap sunscreen. Maybe these scents are appealing to you. I do not want them in my hair. It seems to clean okay, but my hair is just as poofy as ever.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Only shampoo and conditioner I will ever use on my hair.  This product is amazing.  I recommend it to all my friends.

"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Great shampoo and conditioner for curly hair. Cleans hair without stripping and the conditioner is just enough to keep hair silky without weighing it down and helps control the frizz. A little of each goes a long way and the price is right.
"

This stuff is great. Helps tame the frizz
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
This is an edit to my previous review.  When I first bought this set with high hopes, I was unimpressed. I have naturally wavy hair.  It seemed like it was drying my hair out and causing it to be frizzy.  So I stopped using it, moved on to super moisturizing my hair and over the past few months have re-visited devacurl.  Now I'm starting to love it.The shampoo has a very light scent, but the conditioner has a strong earthy smell. I had to get used to this, but now I like it.  After trying it again and using it regularly, I can honestly say that my hair is responding well. The curl is more defined and lasts longer than before.So, if you are unsure, give it a try.  I still think the conditioner needs to be more moisturizing, but they may have one better suited for my needs.  I use this with the devacurl gel, which I love.

"

The smell causes me to reference the air freshener in public restrooms (that fake grapey smell). I'm also not finding that it quenches my curls enough. Works OK as a co-wash.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
It was recommended by a friend and totally love it!!! My so uses it too and likes it too!!! Bonus, it's environmentally friendly!!! Thank you!!
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I love this shampoo and conditioner!!!! I think it even helped my hair grow... HOWEVER! not so great for volume. Since there is hardly any lather while washing hair, you don't really feel like your hair is clean. Also, when I used it with Deval curl light defining gel, my hair was kind off lifeless, the curls where not very spirally, it became tangled very easyly and it my hair iched by the second day. Now, when I didn't add any additional products to my hair, my hair looked so healthy BUT since I need something to keep my curls looking defined and neat, I can't just do shampoo and conditioner. I have recently changed shampoos, because supposedly you have to do it in order to give your hair a break or not get too used to your shampoo (something like that) to the ArtNaturals Argan Oil Hair shampoo and conditioner and I can't wait to switch back to my DEVACURL NO-Poo
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I've been using Deva Curl products for 6 years now and will never go back to anything else. It has made such a huge difference in my thick, curly hair. My curls are defined and not frizzy. I get compliments all the time. Of course, using the full product line and having a good cut is also important.
"

Great curls, but I'm hypersensitive to the scent used.  I gave it to my sister who loves.

"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I really love these products for my and my 4 year old daughter’s hair. I have curly, high porosity and fine color-treated hair and my daughter has thick, low porosity, wavy/curly hair. Both or hair is on the drier side right now due to dry cold in the Northeast.  Since we starting using Devacurl both our curl patterns have improved significantly. I also do not feel the need to wash my hair everyday since I started using this line of products because it’s easy to fix my curls each morning with water and alittle bit of added product. They also smell awesome. I would definitely recommend this line to anyone with curly hair. I had used this line a few years back and changed products to try something new that my salon offered but, I don’t think I’ll be straying again!

I like these products.  Just wish it smelled better.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
The consistency of the conditioner is thin and watery, much different from what I've purchased at a salon previously. I had to mix it with some leftover conditioner I had in order to make it somewhat useable-- needless to say, I probably won't purchase it again from this seller. This is my first time using the low-poo and it seems to feel like what I'd expect a shampoo to feel like, it doesn't dry out my hair at all. I'd buy this again.
"

If you have curly hair and haven't tried Deva Curl products yet, you are missing out! Adds moisture to dry locks without weighing them down. This combo in particular is perfect for medium coarse to slightly coarse hair. I find that the Heaven in Hair conditioner works better for coarser, drier hair. But the whole Deva line is great and affordable for high quality products. Their website has a bunch of useful tips for curly heads too, especially  if you're having a hard time figuring out which product will work for your particular type of curls.Also, sulfate free, paraben free, and smells great but not too perfumey.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"

"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
If you have natural wave or curl, this is a good shampoo and conditioner to put on it.  I started using it after my stylist used it on my hair.  Since then there are a lot more curly care products out there but this is still a staple for me.

Have been using these product and the system for about a month now and I have noticed a big change in how my curls stay and without the need of a ton of gel during the humid summer! Do not expect suds from the shampoo, it is a no-poo, it does not make bubbles. I am using a little more than what I use of regular shampoo per wash, but that might be the getting used to the no suds. So far, I am happy with the product and the system outlined in the book.

Have only use this product once so far but I'm hooked. I had been using another brand cleansing conditioner product for a few years. I enjoyed the softness of my hair but my curls lacked definition. I used the devacurl no poo and condition one with the styling gel and allowed my hair to air dry. I woke up this am to amazing defined curls. I had forgot my hair was this curl. It's soft and shiny with none of the frizz I had before. It's like a new head of hair all together. I encourage all curly haired girls to try this. It's super easy to use and amazing. I will continue to use this product!

During the first shampoo, a golf ball size of hair came out during the shower, and that has never happened to me before. I have wavy, thick Caucasian hair. I have had straight perms, and this stuff smells like that chemical relaxer. After I got out of the shower, my scalp burned a little, and I got freaked out, so I re-washed and conditioned my hair with my usual stuff immediately. I won’t use this again. I don’t know, maybe it’s expired or counterfeit product. I was so excited to try, but I’ll never use it again.

Awesome product. You will notice and feel the difference instantaneuosly! and it only takes a very small amount to make it happen. Be sure to massage your scalp very well when using the cleaner shampoo and for the conditioner use only on the ends of your hair.....Plan to buy this product again and again
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
smells ok, probably works great, but I had to use so much of the shampoo to get my hair clean that investing in this as a daily shampoo would be cost prohibitive (and yes, I have to wash my hair daily or it is disgusting). The conditioner doesn't really do much for my hair. After a few days, the set makes my hair somewhat flat. There are products at the drugstore that work just as well, if not better.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Very disappointed I'm out of my return range time. I wanted to finish my current 32 ounce I had just opened before opening this one. When I opened it, it smelled like nail acrylics. The color appeared similar but the smell is horrific. What a total waste of money for a phoney product. Deva curl work amazing for curly hair and this was NOT devacurl
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I like these two products for my curly hair. It gives my hair more spiral than most shampoos and conditioners. It leaves my hair with a softer feeling than most. I like the smell just fine. It doesn't feel the best when you put it in your hair, but leave the conditioner in just a minute or two and it does well. I am a white female with very thin (individual hairs), that are kind of fluffy.  It helps control my hair.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I don't usually write reviews -  only if I feel very strongly about a product one way or the other. Well this product is truly awful. It actually does the opposite of what it says it does. Deva Curl left my hair dry, frizzy, and out-of-control. On top of that it left my scalp itchy and actually left flakes in my hair. I wanted to give it a chance so I tried it for three days in a row but I just couldn't use it another day . . . I was so unhappy with the way it left my hair.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
To be fair, I really haven't given the No-poo Shampoo a fair chance to assess it's value as a curly hair shampoo. I simply cannot stand the smell which is so much like Ponds cold cream and it totally turns me off. The One Condition Conditioner has a nicer lighter fragrance and I have continued to use it.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Really good shampoo even though it says ""no suds"" it actually foams-up, my hair squeeks when rinsed clean, smells refreshing not over powering or like perfume. The conditioner is amazing, its light and leaves my hair really soft and my curls (3C super fine)  coil with less frizz! I use it as a leave-in. Its pricy, but I dont have thick long hair, so it last long for curl natural wash-n-go.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
I love this product. My naturally curly hair is so thankful! I have tried numerous products that were not good for my hair. I was impressed with the moisture retention. I was also impressed with the quality of the product. I would recommend this product to anyone with curly hair.

I am a male with curly hair. This is the ONLY product I have used that will help tame them and not leave me with a frizzed out afro. That said, I really wish there was an option so I didnt literally smell like roses following using the conditioner.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
Works great! Because I was using sulfate shampoo before this, it took a few days to build up in my hair, but now that it has my hair is non-frizzy, soft, and curls beautifully. I have thin curly hair from the German side of my family, so usually products for curls weigh mine down too much. But my curls are bouncy and well defined, and no trace of stickiness! I will definitely be reordering.

OMG, I cannot believe what an incredible difference this makes in my curls. I was VERY skeptical when I was initially told about it but figured I would give it a try.  I have tried hundreds of other products/combinations to get the most out of my curls and just figured my hair was no longer as curly as it used to be.The Lo-poo gives just enough suds.  The conditioner is not too heavy for my wavy/curly hair.I cannot not stress this enough.....THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!!!  Pricey but soooo worth it.  I use it with the ultra defining gel. I got my best friend to try it next.  Can't wait to see how incredible her hair will look!

To start off, I have relaxed hair, and my natural hair is soft and slightly kinky.My hair dresser (hair dresser in the cold climate) recommended this product to me when I move from a warm humid climate to a cold dry one. In the new climate my hair started  to feel thin so I thought, why not try it. At first it made my hair felt fuller, but the ends still felt brittle. After the second wash my scalp started to itch after 3-4 days. I then tried using the No-Poo along with a dandruff shampoo to get rid of the itch.During the 3-4 weeks that I used this product it just made my scalp itchy and irritated. My sister and I then looked up a reason for why it was irritating my scalp. Bottom line was that the No-Poo was trying to remove the layer of elements that regular sampoo leaves on your scalp to keep it healthy and then replace it with it's own later of minerals (which I'm sure would keep your scalp itch if it didn't irriate it). All of this irritated the hell out of me and I stopped using both the No-Poo and conditioner. About three weeks later my hair started coming out more when I washed it, and the ends we're thinned out (the second part might of been because of my hair dresser's Brazilian blowout hair drying technique --side note, that can pull out your hair--)I would never recommend this product to someone, for one, I almost feel like the product needs a warning label, or some kind of recommendation for what hair types can use it.

I love this kit. I have type 4 a/b tightly coiled curly hair. It can be hard to tame. I love the noo poo, conditioner, coconut styler, and set spray. It isn't too heavy like other products can be. It does not sit on top of the hair. It really penetrates moisture. My curls are always soft and never dry/brittle.
"
Devacurl No-Poo Original 12oz + One Condition 12oz Combo,"
It makes my curly hair feel soft. Sometimes I'm not sure how well it cleans my scalp over an extended amount of time. I'd probably do this most of the time with a break with a good shampoo to get rid of built up oils.

Also, deep condition whenever you shower with shampoo. It sounds like a lot but I just deep condition as I'm washing my body and shaving. The bowl method works wonders, too. I get made fun of by my boyfriend but he loves the results. The bowl method coats each strand of hair equally with product. I found out that most times if a curl is going haywire, it means it didn't get properly coated with product.

I've always had frizzy hair, which would result in loss of curls haflway through the day. Other anti-frizz products would either weigh my hair down or make it look greasy. This is a great balance and works wonderfully for my thin hair. I put it in right after the gel (L'oreal Evercurl) and my hair looks great and smooth for the whole day. It might be pricier than other products, but it is 100% worth it for me.

I've been using this for about 2 months. My very curly hair is starting to thin on top, and a volumizer seemed like a good idea.

Curls 2b/c - anything too heavy weighs down my curls but it NEEDS to be defined and encouraged to curl a bit. It's a battle finding product that I can use since I have REALLY thick hair but light weight enough to keep the curls happy. Moving to FL has been a challenge with the humidity and frizz. This stuff is magic ju-ju. Use on it's own when I'm being lazy. Or as part of my 3 product combo - 1st - wave maker cream 2nd - this volumizing foam and 3rd deva ultra defining gel (not the arc angel - too heavy, makes my hair look greasy) - spray with water and squish each product in layer by layer. Once done, plop in veil net, air dry, then defuse the remaining. Or just straight defuse on low. Good luck curlies!

got this mainly for the frizz and I didn't see any results. On the contrary it seemed to dry my hair and make it stiff and scratchy.

I absolutely love this product when I buy it in the store. This is my first time buying on amazon and without a doubt there is something wrong with this product. Smells and looks the same but my hair was matted, dry and unmanageable after only two days of use. It also wasn’t filled to the top. I’m wondering if they took a half used product and filled it with some other ingredient to make it appear fuller or something. Not sure what happened here but my hair is very dry and feels horrible. I’m putting a deep conditioner in my hair now and hoping it improves.
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
It's just okay. I have thick wavy hair  It makes my hair crunchy and doesn't really do much for volume. I'm better off using gel and clipping my roots for volume.  You can scrunch out the crunch but my hair just looks stringy when I use this. Maybe if have lighter weight hair it would help with volume.
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
When reviewing hair products, the most important thing is to specify your hair type. I have curly, for real curly not scrunched, 2c & 3A curls. My hairs is Caucasian and it is not thin but fine. I also have low porosity hair. This product just weight my hair down so much. My curls were dead. It went back.

I like many Deva products but this is a total fail. This product made my hair sticky, stringy and I didn't get any volume from it.  There are so many other good curly hair products.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Thank you Amazon for your excellent return/refund policy.
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
I'm overall happy with this product. It is a light, airy foam that helps to define my curls without any stickiness. I like that it's a pump so I can control how much product comes out and it lasts for a long time. I don't think it really volumizes my curls at the root, but that might just be because I have long hair and it's so heavy. I keep it in the shower and use it right after I shut the water off. Apply it to soaking wet hair and gently scrunch curls for the best result.

I gave this a 3 star. This product wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. Yes my curls were nice and soft but when I was washing my hair it was tangled and knotted during my shower. I had to use a detangler to wash my hair out! I'll only be using this product sparingly. I am of east Indian descent by the way and I have thick curly hair. And this is my honest review.

It's okay, but not as special as I was hoping it would be, based on user reviews. It's like any other curly hair products out there that I've tried so far - leaves the hair feeling a bit stiff.

I use the styling cream and light defining gel and was pretty happy with those but needed a little more control without hairspray. Adding this mousse was the missing link! Curls last for days now, more manageable, and don’t need hairspray to make it cooperate. I have 3A curls and some gray streaks that don’t play by the rules. The mousse was just what I needed.

I’ve been using this product when I wear my hair curly for many years now. The DevaCurl line was introduced by my stylist when it first came out. She knew I was sensitive to scents and wanted a chemically clean product. The most important is that it works! It makes my curls bouncy, moist and controlled. Those of us with natural curls know that everyday you have to wet your hair to avoid the just got out of bed look. I like that I don’t have to wet my whole head but just let the shower sprinkle my hair and then add the foam for a quick touch up and go!

This product smells great. It is also feels super light weight. This product doesnt hold my curls well enough to use on its own. I do pair it with another product and it does okay on frizz, but not great.

I personally have seen the biggest difference in my hair from this product. It isn’t going to take and completely transform your hair texture, but it’s given me the best hair day I’ve had with my natural hair. I’m happy I tried it out.

White girl with curly hair that gets very frizzy in the summer from the heat and moisture in the air. I have gotten three compliments this week on how stylish my curls look. :)

It is the mouse of my live. I use this for me (wavy hair) and for my kids (super curly hair). The results in both cases are amazing. I love my hair

Love it,  but too pricey. I found a different product I equally enjoy.

"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
Good product in this particular line.  Doesn’t leave your hair stiff or sticky.  Out of all of the Deva Curl styling products, I like this the best.  Does what it says, adds a little bit of volume.  Ive also tried the Curl Maker spray and the styling gel.

DevaCurl products are pricey but do the job. Very pleased with the control this product offers for thick, hard to control wavy hair.

This is a great product for giving your curls a lift! I apply at the roots and diffuse upside down. Works great!
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
Got this to use with the curly girl method and so far so good! After a few days it gets a little nasty though due to buildup. Would definitely recommend for good waves/curls

While I am a huge fan of Deva products, this one was a disappointment. It does nothing to my hair. I was hoping it would replace my mousse, but it was no effective at all.
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
My kinky natural curly hair loves this product!  I don't wash it every day and this product helps to keep it nicer longer.  No frizz and it doesn't weight my hair down.
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
This stuff is soooooo light weight! I absolutely love the smell! If you have unruly hair that needs a strong hold, thisnis not for you! I use this on my roots to add the extra volumenim looking for, and to keep my fly aways tame.

I have ordered this product 3 times now.  It takes the frizz out of my hair and gives me soft curls. I will buy it again.

I’ve used this product for years. But the people that sent me this definitely didn’t know what they were doing. It was sent without a lid, dusty, and dirty on the outside and in the spout. Kind of disturbing when buying something your planning on putting on your head...

The Devacurl frizz volumizing texturizing foam holds my curly hair after I scrunch it and it does not frizz or dry out my hair. Leaves a great shine to my hair.

If you have curly hair, this is perfect for you!! You gotta try this & you won't regret it. The only product my kid will use on her hair. Seriously.....try it.

This is my go-to product for wavy-curly hair. It dries to a soft ""cast"" that I can easily break up with my fingers. Later, if I wet and dry the hair.

Great for my curls but my scalp did not like these products. Gave me an itchy scalp.

I have curly hair and i've been looking for something to texturize my curls.  This isn't it.  It leaves them lackluster at best.

This works great on my wavey hair. Makes great spiral licks without the crunchy look.

Amazing stuff. I have short, fine wavy hair and I have NEVER had a product leave it so soft and not crunchy while still holding the wave and giving me volume. This stuff is worth the $$!

My favorite hair product. I love the way it leaves my hair. Soft and well shaped. I love it and buy it regularly.

It cause bad scalp to me. But works fine for my husband. Does the work pretty good, I liked how my curls turn out but sadly it is not for me.

Love deva products, especially lightweight ones.  My curly hair is thin, so I can't use any products to weigh it down.  This is perfect for roots for extra volume.

Great product for curly hair! Control without getting weighed down or greasy!

Originally, I loved the scent of this product.  However, after a few months, I noticed my hair was shedding way more than normal.  Low and behold, it was because of the Deva Curl. My hair is noticeably thinner. This is happening to a bunch of other people as well. There are youtube videos and a facebook group for you to see for yourself.  AVOID FROM USING.
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
This is the best curly haired styling product I've used in 20 years!  The key is this:  apply to damn hair.  Then WAIT till hair is dry and then scrunch your hair.  It will take away all the ""crispiness"" and leave you with soft bouncy curls.  This is KEY!! And a little goes a long way.

"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
With really curly hair this product works well

Product was listed as 7.5 oz and when it arrived it was 1.7 oz (for $11!).  Watch out for their false advertising.

This product unfortunately doesn't do much for my hair. It's similar to a lot of other foams. Makes my hair feel dry.

Keeps the frizz down. Put in hair while damp and watch it keep that frizz down all day. Oh and it smells like skittles.

This product does not create the product cast around my curl as it normally does when I buy from an actual store front. I tried to complain to the company but they continue to deny and say it is real product. So disappointed.

Leaked all over packaging. Arrived almost empty
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
maybe my hair is too short to use the recommended amount ( one pump) it does give me volume but the best way to describe the result is as though i brushed my curls out  because it spreads the hair out in each curl which does give volume but probably not in the way one might not want with their curls. it does dry the hair out, I can go a full week without washing and my hair wont get oily as it usually does ( I have to wash 2-3x a week) as for frizz free well, what i describe the product doing is basically frizzy but its more like a good week with frizz.again it might have to do with my length, my hair is just starting to touch my shoulders so i would only recommend it to people with longer hair at least pass the shoulders.when i reach that length i definitely want to try this product again

I have very fine curly hair.  I recently learn about Diva Products and had been delighted with the results.  I found that for my fine hair the Curl Frizz-free Volumizing Foam works better than the gels.
"
"DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam, 7.5oz","
I <3 Deva Curl, but this is not a winner at all, at least on its own.  I do see a difference when used with a gel.I used this with the Light Defining Gel, but it isn't as volumizing as I would have liked or expected, and I think the curl definition is from the gel.  When used on its own, it doesn't hold the frizz away at all, and I see no difference between my normal volume and using this product.  If you go to devacurl.com, this product is no longer available for purchase, so there might be a reason why.  Does smell amazing, though!

Devacurl products are causing thousands of people, myself included, to lose hair. My scalp is itchy, and I have to pull a huge wad of hair out of the drain every time i wash it.

I loved that this product was natural and was so pleased with the results...until my entire scalp broke out in large, cyst-like boils after using this product for a few days. It took about two weeks after stopping this product for the cysts to completely clear up and disappear. Really bummed because I wanted a natural curling product, but clearly there is gluten in this. If you have Celiacs or a severe gluten allergy, beware! You may need to find a new product.

This is the best product for curly (turning frizzy when it's humid) hair. If you have curly hair, you're probably always searching for a product that keeps the curl, doesn't dry your hair out, and does what it claims to do. This product comes through on all counts. It preserves my curl for at least three days because as you probably know it's too drying to shampoo curly hair daily. This product also doesn't leave your hair crunchy. It locks in curl but the curls are soft. Love this product!

I have baby fine, super thin hair that has a bit of wave/curl.  Most products for curly hair are way to heavy and oily for my hair.  This is very light, and holds the shape well, not too crunchy.  I have not used anything that is as effective for my hair type as this product is.  The smell is pleasant, in a way I cannot describe, though it's a tiny bit strong.

I bought this because I wanted soft touchable curls, this product gives u defined curls but doesn’t leave your hair soft, the curls are hard/crunchy, I was hoping for soft curls, you get the same results with regular mousse and less expensive. Again, if you are looking for defined curls, this product works well, it doesn’t smell as good as some of the reviews say it does, u will also need to use a lot of the product and make sure all the hair strands have it otherwise your will end up with shine and dry looking hair.Keep this in mind since u can’t return it once u have open it.I hope this review helps

I already have wavy hair but this just enhances my curls.  Best product I have found but you have to apply right out of the shower and squeeze the wetness like you are crunching the hair together in locks with head down.  Then do not dry with towel but use a t-shirt to get the heavy water and then diffuse it with the hairdryer to get it completely dry.  I find if you air dry it is doesn't curl as well.  No other method wil work and if you dry it with a towel and put it on just damp hair it does not work.  Curls last all day.

So far when using this product it makes my hair feel dry.  I hope to find a finishing spray that will help with the ""dry"" or I will return it.  I posted a review a few weeks ago and NOW in the news it is being reported that others are also have dry hair and losing hair.  DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT!!  It's horrible.  I wish I had put in for a refund only a few days ago

I only use this product on second or third day hair as a way to tame frizz and redefine my curls.  It does not work for me when I am trying to create my curls.  It's got too soft a hold.  It doesn't create a cast, as gels and other products do.  But the scent is beautiful and delicate.  Not too strong.

I’m a no blow dry, no flat-iron/curling wand type mom. So I wanted something I could throw in after shower that would hold together my somewhat fluffy hair. This left it kinda stiff and very blah looking. I do love diva curl super cream though! I will be throwing this out and ordering super cream next.

I have fine, curly/wavy shoulder length hair. While still soaking wet,  I use 3 pumps of this and evenly distribute as much as possible, without breaking up the curls, before carefully scrunching with a microfibre towel. Next, I diffuse and then leave to air-dry until completely dry before breaking the cast on the curls. Voila !! Nothing else comes close. It's a non-sticky light foam and has a light fragrance. It also leaves hair (once cast broken) feeling soft and touchable and with a great shine.This is not easy to find in the UK so I was really pleased to be able to order on Amazon.com. Delivery was reasonably quick too so I'm one happy curly-girl.

My 2B/2C hair responds best to this foam -- it's light, quick-drying and has the right amount of hold. I'm left with big soft curls the circumference of sidewalk chalk. Generally I'll apply the foam to micro-plopped hair, give it 5 minutes then scrunch in a bit of water-emulsified gel before diffusing.

I always looked at this product and for whatever reason I just didn't want to try it.  There are so many products that claim to be frizz-free and then they're a disappointment.  I tried this one with no expectations of anything.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.  So, it must have been fluke results.  So, I tried it again.  Great results.  Just as an FYI, I have 3c hair that has had a Deva Cut.  So getting volume was important since that was the intention of my haircut.  I have volume.  I have lift and it is also a great 2nd or 3rd or more day refresher product.  The product isn't sticky.I use the Deva Buildup Buster shampoo and then I condition with Deva One Condition.  Then on reasonably wet (not dripping and not damp) hair, I apply the foam.  If you apply this product or any of Deva's styling products, it's important to start with wet hair or the results aren't as good.  I start with my roots and work my way to my ends.  After I apply the Deva Coconut SuperCream.  I have applied gel after the cream.  But, I reserve that for the most humid days.  Also any with Deva products:  Cream THEN Gel.  These are some great products, but I often see lots of reviews of so-so and negative reviews and I can almost bet they either applied them on hair that wasn't wet enough or out of the cream/gel order.

First - I used the DevaCurl site to recommend this for my fine wavy hair. I bought this and the Ultra Defining Gel at the same time, expecting that I would need both to control frizz, but this product works great alone.  I do use the Ultra Defining Gel for any fly aways as a finishing step.  With my medium length fine hair, I use about 2 pumps and then use my diffuser.  My hair gets super curly vs wavy and doesn't look crispy, but more shiny, which is what I prefer.  I haven't tried many specialized curl products like this, because the ones I have tried in the past were a disaster.  I never knew my hair could be this curly.  I really like this DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Texture Foam.  The only thing I do not like is that it feels a tiny bit chalky when I run my fingers through at the end of the day before going to bed.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I have thick, curly hair and have been a deva products purchaser for 15 years.  I have purchased all of the products, the hair dryer, and Lorraine Massey's books.  I've had my hair cut, multiple times, at a deva salon in NY (fantastic hair cuts!).  Deva products, sadly, dry out my hair and are full of toxic chemicals.  Low poo contains diazolidinyl urea, fragrance, peg-75 lanolin and ped-7 glyceryl.  I've recently tried shea moisture products and have been so pleased with the resulting soft, natural, bouncing curls.  Deva products were purchased by L'Oreal a couple of year ago.  I'm sure they wanted to kill them so they couldn't compete with their products.  I just discovered that Shea Moisture/Sundial was bought out by Dove, so I am expecting more chemicals and possible loss of the product.  I'm weaning off of all deva products and will continue my search for fewer toxic chemicals and clean, soft curls.  I wasn't paid or given free products for this review!

Be careful with counterfeit I sent back all my deva curl products from amazon they itched my head and made my scalp dry after 2 weeks of using the product.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I have low porosity mostly 3A Caucasian hair that is extremely dry and tends to frizz.  Tried various different co-wash and no-poo methods and my hair was still always dry.  I initially assumed my hair was very porous because it was rough and fuzzy, once I learned how to actually tell it wasn't very porous at all, I found out that low porosity hair needs the buildup removed in order to accept moisture at all.  This shampoo has done a very nice job of that for me, it cleans my hair but doesn't leave it feeling as though it's been stripped.  Most other shampoos (and I've tried a lot) leave my hair feeling rough, and it's really hard to find one without silicones and various proteins.  The citrus smell of this shampoo is pleasant as well.  Used with the DevaCurl One Decadence conditioner, my hair feels and looks the best it has in years.  As a sidenote: my hair absolutely hates keratin and most other proteins, but the hydrolyzed quinoa protein in the conditioner does not seem to bother it. This stuff isn't cheap compared to most shampoos, but it's worth it to me.-Updating nearly a year later to add that at some point, the protein in the conditioner became too much.  I have since found Shea Moisture Low Porosity conditioner and it is the best I have ever found.  I use it with the Deva Low Poo cleanser.

I don't have curly hair. Actually, my hair is about as straight as hair can get. I do have curly hair in my family, but it missed me. About a year ago, I was looking up shampoo with the least amount of harmful chemicals. This was one that came up on several lists. So, I tried it out and fell in love. I have somewhat oily hair after not washing it for more than 24 hours. I hate taking a shower every day because it dries my skin out. Most conventional shampoos not only make my hair crazy, but it makes my skin ""itch"". I call it alligator skin. :)  But, this shampoo is gently for both my hair and my skin. A 16 oz bottle lasted me 1 year +, because I only use it once a week, maybe 5-6 times a month. I have mid-back length think hair, and only need a quarter or two sized amount- half the amount of conventional shampoo. I actually like my hair better the second day after using this product.So, if you are looking for a gently shampoo with fewer chemicals, give this one a try.

It really worked on no frizz curls (I have med curly grey hair tends to frizz)... but I did not like the 'dirty' feel & dull look after a half dozen washes. I've talked with friends who have super curly/kinky hair and they do not mind the texture change as much. I switched to another no sulfate shampoo, that, coupled w a good beachy hair lotion did the trick.

I really do not like writing negative reviews but this stuff has made my hair so grossl. It smells great but it does not clean AT ALL. My hair (medium, wavy) is so incredibly greasy despite that I am a regular washer (at least 4 times a week). I thought that I needed to let it adjust or something, but after several weeks of using this, I am going to return it and get my money back. I know tons of people who love deva curl, but for some reason, this stuff is really not doing the trick for my hair.

--If this review helped you, please click ""helpful""--Deva Curl has yet to disappoint me! I have so many of the after-shower products but just recently purchased this. I love it! It really makes a difference (which I didn't think it would) in my curls on wash day. My wash days are so much better than they used to be. I used to dread them and plan my life accordingly but I don't have to do that with this shampoo and conditioner. I do follow with all DC products and my curls love it! They're looking better than ever!--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--

Be careful with counterfeit I sent back all my deva curl products from amazon they itched my head and made my scalp dry after 2 weeks of using the product. I then went and bought it directly from deva curl and the issue went away. Don't be cheap buy from deva curl directly they give you a lot of free things when you order from them.

I have low porosity mostly 3A Caucasian hair that is extremely dry and tends to frizz.  Tried various different co-wash and no-poo methods and my hair was still always dry.  I initially assumed my hair was very porous because it was rough and fuzzy, once I learned how to actually tell it wasn't very porous at all, I found out that low porosity hair needs the buildup removed in order to accept moisture at all.  This shampoo has done a very nice job of that for me, it cleans my hair but doesn't leave it feeling as though it's been stripped.  Most other shampoos (and I've tried a lot) leave my hair feeling rough, and it's really hard to find one without silicones and various proteins.  The citrus smell of this shampoo is pleasant as well.  Used with the DevaCurl One Decadence conditioner, my hair feels and looks the best it has in years.  As a sidenote: my hair absolutely hates keratin and most other proteins, but the hydrolyzed quinoa protein in the conditioner does not seem to bother it. This stuff isn't cheap compared to most shampoos, but it's worth it to me.-Updating nearly a year later to add that at some point, the protein in the conditioner became too much.  I have since found Shea Moisture Low Porosity conditioner and it is the best I have ever found.  I use it with the Deva Low Poo cleanser.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32ozI was hoping that this would leave less of a buildup than the  Devacurl No-Poo Original (Conditioner) Cleanser, but sadly it does not.  It leaves the roots of my hair feeling extremely weighted and slightly greasy looking.  I was looking for something more natural that didn't weigh my hair down, but I am afraid this is not the product I was looking for.

I don't have curly hair. Actually, my hair is about as straight as hair can get. I do have curly hair in my family, but it missed me. About a year ago, I was looking up shampoo with the least amount of harmful chemicals. This was one that came up on several lists. So, I tried it out and fell in love. I have somewhat oily hair after not washing it for more than 24 hours. I hate taking a shower every day because it dries my skin out. Most conventional shampoos not only make my hair crazy, but it makes my skin ""itch"". I call it alligator skin. :)  But, this shampoo is gently for both my hair and my skin. A 16 oz bottle lasted me 1 year +, because I only use it once a week, maybe 5-6 times a month. I have mid-back length think hair, and only need a quarter or two sized amount- half the amount of conventional shampoo. I actually like my hair better the second day after using this product.So, if you are looking for a gently shampoo with fewer chemicals, give this one a try.

It really worked on no frizz curls (I have med curly grey hair tends to frizz)... but I did not like the 'dirty' feel & dull look after a half dozen washes. I've talked with friends who have super curly/kinky hair and they do not mind the texture change as much. I switched to another no sulfate shampoo, that, coupled w a good beachy hair lotion did the trick.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I really do not like writing negative reviews but this stuff has made my hair so grossl. It smells great but it does not clean AT ALL. My hair (medium, wavy) is so incredibly greasy despite that I am a regular washer (at least 4 times a week). I thought that I needed to let it adjust or something, but after several weeks of using this, I am going to return it and get my money back. I know tons of people who love deva curl, but for some reason, this stuff is really not doing the trick for my hair.

--If this review helped you, please click ""helpful""--Deva Curl has yet to disappoint me! I have so many of the after-shower products but just recently purchased this. I love it! It really makes a difference (which I didn't think it would) in my curls on wash day. My wash days are so much better than they used to be. I used to dread them and plan my life accordingly but I don't have to do that with this shampoo and conditioner. I do follow with all DC products and my curls love it! They're looking better than ever!--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--

It arrived not wrapped in anything to indicate that it's new. The top appeared to have been opened before. I don't trust it enough to use it. The picture shows what an actually new item looks like on the right and what I received on the left.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Not good for anyone who actually works up a sweat when they work out - hair never felt clean with this product.Totally ineffective for removing build up. Hair was left flat and oily at the roots. Ended up using a 'clarifying' wash most weeks and in the end, I was thinking, what's the point?
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This is my first Deva Curl product. I found it by chance on amazon while searching desperately for the next shampoo to try. I also discovered the Curly Girl book, which helps a lot. If you have a curly or wavy hair and have never used these products, my suggestion is to get the book first and choose your routine, regardless of whether you plan to use the Deva Curls products or not. My hair is wavy on the curly side. Ever since I started dyeing it to cover the gray hair, it got very dry. Looks like I have to use conditioner every time. This shampoo alleviates the problem a little - it is not as drying as the others sulfate-free products I have used. I am looking forward to try the no-poo shampoo next, as well as the conditioner (the Deva conditioner can be left in the hair if needed depending on the hair dryness).

I have been using Deva Curl products since 2006 with great results. Low-Poo, No-Poo and One Condition have been my go to. The company has been sold 3 times since then and apparently has added some toxic chemistry to their products. In the last several years, I have noticed severe hair loss at my scalp and my hairline. My hair used to be so thick that hairdressers joked that they'd have to sharpen their scissors after my haircut. My hair is now so thin, I can see my head and my curls don't last beyond the first day and turn into fuzz and frizz where there used to be curls. My hair used to be healthy and grew fast. I haven't had a haircut in 3 years and my hair does not seem to be growing. My diet is excellent and I feel fine. This product sucks and has damaged my hair and a whole community of former DevaCurl users. There are a few Facebook groups with horrible stories of what's happening to them because of DevaCurl's products. One group has over 11,000 members
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I thought sulfate free shampoo is good, but my stylist told me, “what’s the point?” I should’ve listened because you have to wash a few times to get your hair cleaned. At first, you wouldn’t know the difference in a clean scalp. It’s something to take for granted, until you’re scalp gets sticky and you don’t understand why it’s still sticky after three washes. You can develop dandruff or bacteria/fungus on your scalp if you don’t wash a few times in one sitting. Eventually, I threw it away.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
First off let me tell you a little about my locks. I have mid back length, fine curly hair but lots of it. Curly on the bottom, with waves from the scalp for the rest. I do not color or otherwise try to alter my curls. I have spent years trying this and that ""fabulous"" salon, non ""fabulous"" organic blah blah, dermatologist recommended, more blah blah shampoo than me or my wallet cares to think about. I have never found anything that compares to this product. I use to have horrible itchy, tight, burning scalp. No more. One wash every three days, no itching. My scalp problems were finally attributed to P.C.O.S for any of you girls out there that may also have this little problem. Try this product, it really is worth a shot, dealing with hair loss is bad enough for a woman. Never mind having to deal with all the other itching and dandruff problems too. A million stars to Deva Curl, Thank you.

Terrible smell. Does not smell like the normal Devacurl products. As a customer for ten years of devacurl I’ve never had this issue. Seller was czbrm.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I bought this in July of 2018. About a week into using it I noticed my hair completely changed. My hair was shedding all the time and looked unhealthy. I’m guessing this was a fake. My hair has never changed before. Ever since then even after discontinuing using this product my hair is still shedding/coming out. Wish I never bought. :(
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I purchased the low poo original but received the low poo delight. The delight doesn't leave my hair feeling clean... so disappointed!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
My curls are finally free!  This shampoo has helped my hair feel more healthy than ever. I have S-curl type hair, layered cut and moderately short.  I have been using this shampoo for a year and see a big difference in how my curls lay and feel.  I don't use a hair dryer anymore and just scrunch my hair with my fingers and air dry.  This was a new experience for me but the dryer was drying out my hair (along with menopause) and I really thought I was losing my curl. Then I found Curly Girl website and learned a lot about my hair type and how curly hair should be taken care of.  Ordered the shampoo, which on Amazon is a lot less than in a salon, and started the journey of rediscovering my curls!  What a difference!  I even have curly hair in the cold winter, whereas before, it would be flat and lifeless.  Great shampoo! Just ordered the 32 oz. pump bottle.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love that DevaCurl Low Poo leaves my hair feeling moisturized after washing....unlike most typical shampoos that make your hair feel stripped of its natural oils and really dry afterwards.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Maybe some people don't need real shampoo, but after using this I know I do. This ""cleanser"" didn't make my hair feel clean; my scalp was greasy the same day that I washed it with this, and the next day I would get pimples on my scalp. I really gave the product a try because my hair is curly and dry, but after using a third of the bottle I'm getting rid of it and buying real shampoo!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Switched from the no poo to the low poo recently for my curly headed kid and i love this. I dont notice her hair being any dryer with the low poo vs no poo but its easier for her to wash her hair by herself since there is a bit of a lather and its easier to work into her curls
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
About 6 years ago, my straight hair began turning very wavy and on the verge of curly.  I had no idea how to tame the curls and frizz so I did a little research and learned about curly hair from a few knowledgeable websites.  I spent quite a bit on different shampoos and conditioners before finding this little jewel.  I love this stuff!  It lathers just a tiny bit (could be because I add a little avocado or coconut oil to the mix sometimes), but my hair feels incredibly soft and controllable after shampooing.  I take it with me whenever I travel.  Oh, and this stuff lasts along time and, because I often add oil to the mix, it really extends the product.  Great stuff!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Deva would do well to change their packaging colors for their different products. I've made this mistake twice now and gotten ""Low-Poo"" instead of ""No-Poo"". The ""Low-Poo"" doesn't smell good to me, and the rest of the family also seems to vastly prefer the ""No-Poo"" product.Other than that, it works great.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I absolutely love this product so the star rating is not because of the quality of the product but when I received it the top was halfway off and there was shampoo all over the box, the packing paper, bubble wrap and the bottle.  No damage to the box whatsoever.
"

My favorite shampoo. I’ve been using it for years and every stylist I’ve had has commented on the health of my curly hair.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This is my favorite shampoo as it is so gentle but also cleans my hair without the harsh chemicals. I love Low-Poo Shampoo and their Decadence Conditioner. They both leave my hair soft and silky. I have been using DevaCurl for a couple of years now and they have yet to disappoint me.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This was supposed to be a great product and i had my hopes set high. But it made my scalp very itchy.  I noticed when using any deva curl products that i wiuld loose about 4-5x the hair that i normally do while showering. So i discontinued use.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I am a total DevaCurl devotee. Until I found this product line I was always fighting my curls (read: my frizz) and wishing I had straight hair. However, with the shampoo, conditioner and sometimes the gel, I have great hair days all the time. People are constantly stopping me and asking ""Is your hair naturally like that??"" Anyone with curly hair will be able to relate to how crazy it makes you look when you can't get it to behave, but these products are magic. I wish they were cheaper, but I'm so happy with the result I don't mind paying more.
"

Recently switched to the curly girl method and after trying a few different low-poos/co-washes, I realized this one is the best for my hair!

"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Once you've adjusted to the DevaCurl line of products, it's very hard to switch back to ""normal"" shampoos, even those specifically  marketed for curly or wavy hair. My hair consistently looks good when I'm using this line of products and I notice a huge difference if I use a regular shampoo (for example, when I've forgotten to bring the Low-Poo while traveling!).
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
So as I got older my hair ends just were not holding up to daily shampoo.  My hair is too fine to not shampoo daily.  This product is perfect to clean my hair daily, while not wearing it out like shampoo would.  Just a bit of lather is great.

Excellent product for those of us with curly hair. Maintains natural curl without any frizz. I've been using it for years and recommend it highly. Somewhat expensive but worth it.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I have low porosity, fine-medium, wavy 2B hair. This low poo still weighs me down. So heavy, no matter how hard I scrub/lather or the amount I use, it still stretches my waves/curls and makes my hair feel unclean. I'm not even using it to get rid of it, I really just want to throw it out. NOT good especially for the price!

"

Switched from Deva wavy products. Thinking this was similar. Smells completely different and dried out my hair badly. My hair went from soft moisturized waves to a frizzy mess. Going to buy the wavy hair set. Waste of money.

My favorite shampoo, have been using it for about a year.  I have keratin treated hair and need shampoo that is Sodium and Sulfate free products and this one fits the bill.
"

I've been using this product for 1 year now and love it. It is wheat-free (which not all DevaCurl products are).  Price is very competitive so I keep buying it here. This is a large salon-size jug, but I like it like that since it's the only shampoo I use.  Plus, having the pump makes dispensing it easy.I strive to provide useful reviews, so it this was helpful to you, please give my review a thumbs up :)

The first time I used this shampoo it felt like my scalp was being burned. It felt acidic. I don't really know how else to describe it because I've never felt anything like it. The closest feeling is cutting hot peppers and the burn on your skin. It was awful. I will be throwing the bottle away.

"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I tried this shampoo on recommendation from a friend who suspected it would make my hair wavy instead of in-between straight and wavy.  She was right, but the waves only hold for a few hours, sadly.  I have medium-think hair and a naturally oily scalp, and this shampoo doesn't get my hair clean even after using it for 1.5 months.  I'll keep looking for another product to make my hair hold waves... but sadly this wasn't it.

I have 2c curly hair and I've had problems with frizz and dryness and my hair flattening out within 8 hours of washing it. I've been using this every day since I got it (almost two weeks) and I have not had a bad hair day since I gave up dove and pantene. My hair feels SO healthy and people have been commenting on how shiny it is which is a comment I've never received before now. I could go with washing it every other day but I don't need to because my hair doesn't feel dry or damaged at all after washing, in fact exactly the opposite. And I love the smell! I literally just can't get over how perfect low poo is for my hair. I wish I'd found it years ago.Update: haven't used anything else for three years. will never go back to regular shampoo.

As someone with curly hair, this shampoo is perfect for me. Doesn't dry hair and leaves them frizz free.I do have to use my normal shampoo after 2-3 days coz i don't feel this cleans hair efficiently. I'm trying to combine both shampoos now. Seems to be working fine for now.

I was born with wavy/curly hair had had nothing but problems trying to make it look presentable and nothing I did worked.  I blew dry trying to make it straight, but that just damaged my hair. As I got older my hair started to thin some and made it even worse.  I decided to let it grow natural, but couldn't find a product that would give my curls a natural look without weighing them down until I found Deva Curl Low Poo Shampoo and it's companion products. This shampoo cleans but does not strip the hair of its moisture. So I use it and their Conditioner plus their ArcGel and my hair looks great.

I love this product, and I didn't have any problems with the 12 oz bottle because it just has a lid. But the packaging on the 32 oz bottle (which has a pump) was pathetic. The only protection it had was a single piece of tape across the top. It was shipped with other items, including some electronics, which had shampoo all over them when they arrived. Fortunately nothing was damaged, but it definitely could have been. Also, about an inch of the bottle had come out... Very displeasing. There needs to be extra protection in these shipments.

As a faithful user of No Poo, I was craving some suds in my hair and a stylist told me about this. Yes, it does give me suds and works well, but the ungodly smell is strong and I can only liken it to Super Glue. Nothing like the sweet smell of No Poo. Sorry I bought 32 oz, but will not be buying this again.

My hairdresser warned me that buying hair product online could be bad and I took the risk anyway. Was short on time and needed more product. I've been using DevaCurl for several years so I know how my curly hair should react to this product.  After using this product my curls were lifeless. The correct substance gives my curls bounce.  I got a sample of the same shampoo from my hairdresser and the consistency is different than the shampoo purchased online. One of the many reasons I love this line of hair product is because it does not effect my ears. Almost all other hair product causes my ears to itch.  I knew this wasn't the true product b/c my ears starting itching right away which lead to a very bad ear infection.  Three solid reasons to NOT buy this product. Only buy name brand products in a salon or reputable hair supply distributor.

love this deva curl product!  brings our my natural curls.  i also use the one conditioner by deva curl.  shipping was fast.  thank you!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This is a great shampoo if you do not mind that it does not lather much at all. I have really curly hair that dries out but when I use this with the conditioner it seems to keep my hair hydrated pretty well and gets my hair clean. My curls are bouncy afterward so I know it does not leave a heavy residue and rinses out well. I also have color treated hair and this shampoo seems to make the color last longer. It smells nice and is made from some natural ingredients which I find important for my health and my hair. My only problem is that I feel like there is not enough in my hair because it does not lather much at all. If this is what you are looking for it is a great shampoo.

I know this product is supposed to be for people with curly hair, but I just had to give it a try.  I have long, straight hair.  A hair stylist told a friend of mine with short straight hair that Deva Curl products would make her hair curl.  She tried it and it worked. It gave her waves and body.  So, I had to give it a try.  I have hair where a couple pieces curl in the rain but that's about it.  I bought Deva Curl Low Poo, Deva Curl One Conditioner, and Deva Care Arc Angel Gel.  After using the cleanser and conditioner, I dried my hair with a towel and combed it out.  I could see waves starting to happen.  I scrunched it the Arc Angel Gel, and I had waves and body.  I really couldn't believe it.The problem is that I didn't feel like it got my hair very clean.  I like shampoo that leaves your hair squeaky clean, and this product does not do that.  This cleanser, Low Poo, only suds a little.  I never felt my hair have that clean feeling when I was washing it, but it could just be me.  I've had that issue with several shampoos because they don't give the squeaky clean feeling.  I wouldn't let that discourage you.  Every one is different.They make a No Poo that doesn't suds at all.  I've tried Wen products and felt that they made my hair too flat and oily the next day.  In that aspect, Deva Curl is similar.  The day I first washed it, it had a lot of body and looked pretty good.  It gives it that wind-blown messy look.  The second day, it was tangled and oily looking.  So, if you are like me and only wash every other day, you will have to wash every day with this product.  Overall, I don't regret buying it.  I will use it for days when I want a different look, but I will just have to expect to wash it the next day.

This product went moldy after using only half a bottle.  That's $18 down the drain!!  No way I'm investing in this product again.  A hair stylist recommended I invest in this product for my curly hair.  It cleans my hair but that's about it!  I never noticed, within the 6-8 months I've used it, any difference in my curls.  In warm weather and cold.  What a waste of my money.

Just a heads up to others, this is the original low-poo formula not the delight formula. It lathers way more than the delight, makes me hair feel dry, and smells absolutely terrible. I will be returning it and ordering the delight version again.

"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love Deva Curl!  I wanted to try the Low Poo thinking I would prefer having a little bit of bubbles when I washed my hair but I don't like this as much as the No Poo mostly because the scent is too sweet/fruity for me.  It also feels like there is a little residue with the Low Poo when I rinse and I don't like that feeling.  It just wasn't for me.  It still makes curls more defined and doesn't dry my hair out so I still like it.  I'm sure for those who don't care for the scent/feel/no bubbles of the No Poo might like this one better.  But once I run out of the Low Poo, I'm going back to the No Poo.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love the Deva Curl products and I have been using them for years. I use the Low Poo No Fade Shampoo, One Condition No Fade Ultra Creamy Conditioner and Angel Conditioning Gel every day. Here and there I use Mist-er Right Lavender Curl Revitilizer to give my curls a regroup when they are getting too crazy or a pick me up when they are looking flat. I also like to use Set-It Free Moisture lock when they are too wind blown, frizzy or have too many fly-aways. I am a regular person, I do not make any money from Deva Curl and I have no affiliation with them. I am just a customer who loves their products! I'll admit the price is a hard pill to swallow sometimes for me but I've tried LOTS of other products and this is the best hands down. I have natural very curl hair and my hair loves this stuff. I get more compliments when I follow a 100% Deva Curl regimen than when I have tried anything else. Plus, after crunching some numbers, I spend about the same on these products yearly when I buy the big bottles of each product as I do for the cheap / lower cost store brands I've tried. A little bit of this product goes a long way each time, the big bottles last me several months, at least 3 if not 4 or more, and the quality is stellar. It takes double the amount of the cheap products to do a fraction of the job that the Deva Curl products do for my locks.  I always shop for the best deal here on Amazon. The products are literally double or triple the price anywhere else in the town I live (Jacksonville, FL) b/c the only places who sell it are salons. From one curly girl to another this stuff is awesome, I love it, it's worth the price, buy it on Amazon for a better deal and if you know a place with even better deals let me know!

It takes a bit to get used to the minimal suds, that is why I don't use the no poo, but it is great.  There is no residue left on your hair, it helps the curl stay curly and not frizzy. I wash my hair twice a week instead of every other day or daily as prior to use.  The only negative that I have is it leaves a lot of gunk in the tub.  Since I bathe instead of shower, I end up with a ring.  To solve this problem, I wipe down the tub immediately after draining the water.

Was referred to this product line from my hairdresser - I had to relearn how to care for curly hair.  Now I go 2 years or more between hair cuts - just because I start noticing split ends...2 years?!  I only wash my hair 1-2 times a week and use the conditioner Deva Curl Low-Poo Mild Lather Cleanser and One Condition Ultra Creamy Daily Conditioner Duo 32 Oz.] ]and light defining gel to lock in the moister.  Also, I don't straighten my hair anymore because I love it curly now, never brush or comb when dry, only use a wide toothed comb in the shower while conditioner set to remove tangles, and I only blow dry with a diffuser and clips [[ASIN:B00143WQI6 Diane Double Prong Clips 80 Clips if I need to go somewhere within a couple hours of a shower.  (the clips are used to hold body in the curls during drying)I have to mention the No-Poo Cleanser caused me to get hard itchy bumps along my hairline.  Which I thought was skin cancer, but Doctor said they  were from an allergic reaction.  A year after I had changed to the No-Poo I realized what the change had been that caused the bumps.  My hairdresser confirmed and said that if you experience a reaction to the No-Poo that the Low-Poo is the better option.  So - I switched and sure enough all the bumps and symptoms went away.  That was years ago now and I am still going strong with these products.

I did not purchase my products from Amazon, I purchased from an authorized retailer, but they aren’t posting my review so I am posting here too. DO NOT buy devacurl products! I have lost probably 1/3 at least of my hair from these products, my hair is damaged, it hardly curls anymore, my scalp was itchy/burning and I had a major dandruff problem while using these products. A simple google search will show you the controversy going on currently with devacurl. Don’t waste your money and don’t risk this happening to you! I believe at one time their products were good and that’s why the reviews are mostly good, but something has changed with their products and they aren’t what they used to be. Their reviews should reflect these changes. There is a current class action lawsuit forming against them for the damage they’ve caused to at least tens of thousands of people. Probably more. Don’t risk it happening to you too!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I have NEVER done this, but I've just deleted my 5-star low-poo review and must replace it with this 1-star review. That probably seems terribly dramatic, but whatever Deva has done to the formulation of their low-poo has absolutely RUINED it!!!!!!!  I was using a bottle that was purchased in October (from Ulta) and it was WONDERFUL - left my 3c corkscrews so soft, elastic and bouncy with absolutely no frizz! I just got a new bottle and couldn't believe what came out of the bottle. It looked and smelled the same but it barely lathered (I had to use a lot more) and left my hair hard, dry, knotted and frizzy (after conditioning and styling/drying).  I was so taken aback! I then used the very last dregs I could squeeze out of my old bottle (the following day) and, ta-da! - bouncy, soft, elastic curls, so it wasn't just my imagination!I even RETURNED and exchanged the new bottle thinking maybe I somehow got an adulterated batch, but no luck! My sister even tried a THIRD new bottle and she had the same result as me - hard, knotty, straw-like hair - the complete opposite of our results with previous bottles of low-poo.DEVA - I have no idea WHAT you have done to the low-poo, but you have completely destroyed the best cleansing product my hair had EVER seen! I so wish I had stocked up on big bottles of it this past summer, but of course I couldn't have anticipated this. What a huge disappointment.  I will never buy this again (though, who knows, maybe since Ulta has such a great return/exchange policy, I'll try again sometime down the line out of nostalgia).  This new formulation is HORRIBLE. Absolute junk.  Looks like my search begins again for a 'curly girl' cleanser that will give me good results.  I'm going to try Giovanni 'smooth as silk' shampoo - Giovanni Smooth as Silk Shampoo, Packaging May Vary, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)... here's to hoping!

I have been using this product for a month now, and while I really think it does a great job at hydrating, I am concerned about not combing the hair. Gliding fingers through the hair in the shower seems like a bad idea, since I tried it and lost lot of hair. Not sure how others are doing it ? I also only use this once or twice a week, so the whole week hair looks great, but is all tangled up, and when I use the deva products at the end of the week, there is lot of hair loss. If anyone has suggestions, please guide.Thanks!

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Of all the vast number of products I have tried over many years for curly hair, I keep coming back to the Low Poo version of the DevaCurl shampoo. Buying in a huge bottle really saves money and will last you a very long time. They've even improved this version by removing the red dye and it had a built-in pump. The smell is very light citrus and not overwhelming. I have tried the No Poo version and found it left my hair too oily. The Low Poo is just right.The feel of the cleanser is going to be different than regular shampoos you may have tried before. I typically do 3 phases, the top and sides of the scalp, the underneath of the hair, and then part about halfway on the back of my head and gently massage. Then I will gently pull the cleanser through to the ends of my hair and rinse, rinse, rinse. If I've been very active (it's the summer in SE U.S.) I may repeat.I do not follow-up with any other products because my particular hair style doesn't really need it. This cleanser leaves my hair soft and curly with just a nice touch of shine. If it's going to be very humid and I'm worried about things flying around, I do have one of the DevaCurl smoother sprays that I can add to wet hair.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
At the time, I had never bought a DevaCurl product from the store. So when I got this, I wouldn't have known if it was knock off or not. It did smell great, like a salon quality product, and it made my hair feel really good. It didn't make my hair look different though, my curls looked the same. Since then, I have bought this shampoo from a salon and there is a distinctly different smell. The salon poo has more of a lemony scent. This makes me think this product could be a knock off. But, don't care! It smelled better and still made my hair feel cleaner.

I was looking for a light conditioner without silicones, and I thought this would do the trick, but I missed that it’s got lanolin in it (the same stuff you use for nipple cream when you’re nursing!). It leaves a massive waxy buildup in my hair. I look like a greaseball 8 hours after washing, even if I only use a dime-sized amount on my bra-strap-length hair.Gave it 3 stars because I guess if you have insanely dry, corkscrew-curly hair, it’ll work for that. I dunno. But it’s definitely not a “light” conditioner.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
1st-Product arrived damaged. Cap was completely destroyed. Have to take off the top to squeeze the product out.2nd- Now, the product itself is great thus far. I have low porosity 4 type hair, protein sensitive.Surprisingly, my hair felt pretty moisturized afterwards. Followed up with orginal one conditioner,  b leave in and ultra gel. My hair was very defined, not weighed down, and moisturized after 2 days. I spray set it free spray every other day and steam my hair in the shower. Cuticles are open and product absorbs.*Yes, the Deva gels have protein in it, but they are the smaller (absorbing) and moisturizing proteins that work well with most loo po hair. However, always remember to clarify at least once a month if loo po.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
At first, I loved this as it made my curls look fabulous. However, after time, I noticed my hair never felt clean and my hair fell out at an alarming rate in the shower. My hair was getting thinner too, where you are supposed to use the most shampoo. Two days after stopping using this product line, I noticed I only am loosing a few strands of hair which is normal. Very disappointed in a product that would cause hair loss.  After reading more reviews, I discovered people were also loosing their hair with this product as well.

If you have curly hair, you really need to give this a chance. I have had curly hair since I was 14 (puberty somehow turned my hair curly from straight), and my curls are 3B with low porosity. I have tried tons of salon hair care products to keep my hair moisturized, and through college, I turned to huge bottles from Big Lots because that's all I could afford. I tried the ""no-shampoo"" method for nearly a year, and when my family found out, they splurged and got me this. Oh how my life has changed. I use this shampoo every other day (no need to use it more often than that), and the 32 oz. bottle has lasted me over a year with 1/3 of the bottle left. It does not lather at all, so don't expect it to. Although others have said to use it liberally, I have never found the need to. A small amount goes a long way if you're willing to distribute it thoroughly. Your hair feels completely clean regardless. It also hydrates your curls so well, a feeling I have never experienced after using harsh shampoos that strip your hair of everything. Follow up using a curl-specific conditioner for perfect hair every time. I use L'oreal sulfate-free products because I'm poor and cheap.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I really like Deva products however my hair is bleached about halfway down but, I want to grow it out. DevaCurl No-Poo original and DevaCurl conditioner really helped the tangled mess after a shower but even after using a 32 oz. a bottle I wasn't comfortable with the no-poo feel while washing my hair. I guess after 50 years of harsh shampoos it was hard getting used to no suds. I purchased the Low-Poo thinking it would only suds up a little but it did sud up a lot and even after using the conditioner this was the most tangled I've ever had after washing, I had so much breakage! I am definitely going back to the NO-POO asap!

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This shampoo is definitely not no-poo gentle, nor is it not 'poo enough to really clean my hair. The consistency is weird...slimy. The feeling I have when I use it is that I have to keep adding more for it to cleanse my hair. If I use just a little bit my hair feels grungy. Something is just not right with this pricey product. The end result is that this shampoo leaves my hair dull and very dried out. The biggest (only?) plus I give this low-poo is that the scent is nice. btw, I have wavy-to-curly thick caucasian hair.

I have curly hair and I have been using loo poo shampoo for a year. I love it my hair have not look better. They are no freeze dry and out of control. I do not use any chemicals or even hair dryer to dry my hair. It wash with loo poo put a little Devacurl gel and I am on my way. I would recommend this to all with curly hair.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I don't normally write reviews, but this one is worth it. I have very fine, thin, dry, type 3A/3B curls and the Low-Poo works wonders. I used to shower and wash my hair every day because I run regularly, and using shampoo really just destroyed my hair. Now I've been using the Low-Poo and a regular conditioner and my curls are shiny and healthy (and it's only been a few days!). The product smells pleasant (not fruity or sweet). Would definitely recommend for people with dry hair who have to wash frequently.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
It’s does my hair justice. It’s so hard to go back to regular shampoo after using this one. People tell me all the time that they can smell my hair hours after I bathed. My hair feels and looks clean even days after.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
My curly hair (3a/3b I think?) is fine and gets fairy knots and otherwise tangled very easily.  Too much product can easily weigh it down.  Most shampoos leave it feeling over-dried and frizzy, and a more ""no-poo"" route leaves my roots feeling oily.  Usually I have to rely on conditioner to actually de-tangle my hair, but I was amazed when this shampoo did that before I even attempted conditioner.  I read some people said it smells bad, but I think mine smells like the green apple Jolly Rancher candy.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I switched from Shea Moisture to DevaCurl and couldn't be more pleased. I get to go longer between washes of my 3a/3b non-porous curly hair and feel like the products last longer, even if the short term price tag is higher. I use this with the weightless waves conditioner and the soft hold gel most often. It has a light botanical smell that disappears quickly.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I'm still trying to find a shampoo that doesn't leave my hair feeling like straw after. The Low Poo is better than most of the competing brands which can weigh your hair down or even drier. The scent is light and pleasing, but bear in mind if your'e used to shampoos that suds up, the Low Poo requires a bit of water to get sudsing action.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love this cleanser.  The fragrance is not overwhelming, and it's very gentle on my hair and scalp.  I was able to reduce the frequency with which I was my hair through using this shampoo.  I can get away with two, sometimes three days, whereas with conventional shampoos, I would be greasy by the end of the day.I'm a curly, but I still blow dry my hair pretty regularly (gasp).  I feel like this cleanser is good for either purpose.EDIT: I no longer love this one. I found after only a few weeks of use, I started getting a lot of white, greasy buildup in my hair. I was using only curly girl products, and as directed. I don't really use the shampoo anymore, but the gel is still my go-to
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Recived it came opened and was spilled all over the bag
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I finally have come to know that it's this shampoo that makes my hair smell dirty, after some experimenting. OK, I do have thicker hair and didn't know that this was for fine hair, but whenever I use it, if I go a day without washing my hair - it will smell grosser than it ever has in my life. I love all my other Deva Curl products. Hate this shampoo!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Saved my dry, damaged coarse curly hair. I have this obsession where I HAVE to wash my hair every day even though I know it's terrible for me. This did just the trick, I get the clean feeling and refreshed hair-do while also retaining the moisture my hair so needs. Love devacurl. Devacurl or die.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I'm so glad I realized there was a difference between the 'Original' formula and the 'Delight' formula which I had originally tried. This original formula has a MUCH nicer scent. I was ready to switch brands because of the obnoxious smell of the Delight, but now I'm re-sold on this shampoo.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Used once or twice a week, this keeps my hair soft and locks in more moisture than regular shampoo, super important in this low-humidity atmosphere. I still need to use regular shampoo at least once a month to deep-clean though; using more of this product just doesn't cut it and my hair starts getting flat if I wait too long. Considering it takes a month to get there though, I am quite satisfied with this shampoo!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I am very happy with my product, the only problem is that it arrived with the bottle cap broken and the shampoo spilled out into the box.  The vendor replaced it and the second bottle was ok I live this shampoo because it defines my curls so nice I dont need mousse.  I'm very happy with it.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Deva products are overpriced, but this shampoo is excellent.  Lathers but not too much, smells fresh, and doesn't weigh down fine hair.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Great smelling, no additives, have been using this for years. I am never afraid of putting the Deva products on my hair and scalp and having my skin absorb bad chemicals; Deva is natural and best for curly girl hair! The Low-Poo version (as opposed to the No-Poo) gives you the lather you might desire, although I do switch between the two. There is no buildup in my hair and it works best for my curls. My hair is never dry feeling after using DevaCurl. I have medium curly hair.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Great product and failure of shipping. Lost a couple of ounces. If manufacturer would lock the lid, it would keep it from untwisting during shipping. I count myself lucky, b/c others lost more product than myself.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Love this shampoo! I have white girl curly thick hair and this shampoo is great. Ir doesn't make my hair greasy and works perfectly with my other Deva Curl products
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This review is for the product not the seller. The product came on time and decently packaged.I have the No Poo Cleanser and love it. This Low-Poo cleanser smells insanely like chemicals. Made my scalp dry, itchy. My curly hair is lank and dead and I am so surprised. I bought this huge bottle and can not use it now. I will have to stick to the No Poo cleanser which is much creamier and doesnt smell like death.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I have the No-Poo also, which I use 75% of the time. But sometimes I just want a deeper clean faster, and this does a great job without drying my hair. Been using six months now and my curly hair is looking healthier all the time!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Scent was not as nice as the regular version of this. Also it lathered too much compared to their other product. Also it didn't bring out curls as well.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This shampoo/ lo-poo smells so good! If you are have a curly hair it will save your curl ( no frizz or dry hair)just make sure you only use water based hair products as this shampoo doesn't clears oily products very well..
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This shampoo truly brings out the natural curl in my hair! Great product!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I prefer the no-poo (I ordered this by mistake) but this is also very good.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I've used this product for over a year now and wouldn't use anything else!  I tried the No-Poo, but it just took too long to work though my hair and finally feel like it was clean.  The Low-Poo gives just enough lather.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Switched from No-Poo to Low Poo to see if my hair would tolerate it a bit better. The Low Poo is quite a bit easier to apply and rinse out of my long, thick, curly hair. It does have a chemical smell when applying, which is the reason for 4 stars. I don't seem to notice it after my shower.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Perfect. The same one I normally buy at the salon. However this one is a bit cheaper and gets ships to my house. Win, win.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I am a huge fan of Deva products and love that they come in such large sizes. I have fine hair and have found the low-poo works better for me than the no-poo. The no-poo left my hair a bit lank, but with the low-poo it is full of volume. If you are on the fence, buy a smaller size of each to compare before committing to the larger size. I have chin-length s' wavy hair, and the large bottle lasts me about six months.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Nothing wrong with the product but No Poo works better for my hair which is wavy not terribly curly.  I tried this because my stylist said it would make my hair look fuller.  It did but No Poo gives me more curl.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
It's low-lather.  That's one of its selling points, but I have very thick hair and I had to use a LOT of shampoo to get it to travel through my hair and get my scalp clean.  If your hair is dry or thin or delicate this might be right for you.  I wasn't in love.  I love the Deva Curl gel though!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
My stylist recommended Devacurl for my fine 3b frizz prone hair and I've been using it for a month. I love it. I now get compliments on my hair and people asking what I use. I'm falling in love with my curls.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Not same as purchased at Harmons . Much cheap with coupons
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love that this cleanser is super mild with no sulfates. It is gentle on my curls and doesn't strip my hair of essential oils. The Deva Curl line has never let me down, but unfortunately I seem to be allergic to this. Every time I've used it, my head becomes extremely itchy. I hope no one else has this reaction to it, but I thought I'd share my experience. I will stick with the NoPoo from now on.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I tried some my friend bought from a salon before buying this. It works just as well as what she purchased for a lot less. My hair is so much curlier, softer, and less frizzy. I don't use any other product (not even conditioner) on my hair since switching to this low-poo.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Great for daughters naturally curly hair.  She has THICK, LONG curly hair and this helps keeps it from drying, breaking and frizzing.  There's plenty more to her hair routine--this is just part, but it does seem to help.  Does not lather so it takes getting used to.  Light fragrance that doesn't stay so it doesn't interfere with other product scents.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I got this shampoo because of all the good reviews and the results other people showed. I used until I got a really bad dandruff. Two stars because made my hair curly as I want.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"

"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Love, love, love.  This is an excellent product for people with wavy hair.  It really keeps my hair smooth, even in high humidity.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Good product for baby fine hair.  It's had for me to find hair products that don't weigh down baby fine hair.  This works pretty good when you alternate the days you use it or it starts to build up like most products.  Baby fine hair is tricky to keep it looking moisturized with out looking greasy or weighed down.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I purchased the larger bottle of this, and it's lasting longer than I expected...good thing since it is a little bit of an investment on haircare products.  The one thing I love is that I no longer have an itchy scalp throughout the day after washing my hair.  With dry, curly, semi-coarse hair, this can be a problem.  But the itchiness is no more!  I have long hair, not as thick as it used to be due to excessive shedding and thinning over the past three years, and I'm getting away with about 4 pumps of shampoo, sometimes 5.  So this is good, I expect the bottle will last a while for me.  I love that the scent is mild, and my hair does not feel weighed down or heavy.  I tried doing the conditioner-only wash over a year ago, and this did not do anything good for my hair.  It became very tangle-y and matted and eventually accumulated build-up at the roots, even though I was using all products with no 'cones.  I like actually being able to wash my hair and know that I'm not stripping it completely and at the same time actually getting it clean.  I will eventually try out the Deva conditioners and see how they work for me as well.  I can't say that the texture of my hair has improved any at this point, but it's definitely clean and scalp isn't itchy, so that's good enough for me!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love this product. Most shampoos leave my hair feeling dry, needing conditioner. This left my hair feeling moisturized and healthy. I see a very clear difference in my hair after switching. I will never use “regular” shampoo again.

"

I started with the no poo, but the combination of the no poo and the one condition was a little no conditioning for me. Since I switched to the low poo my curls have been happier and not weighed down.

It makes my hair feel soft and clean. I alternate it with Soma clarifying shampoo. That routine has helped add more shine to my hair.

"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This, and it's friend 'No-Poo', (and I don't care what anybody thinks of the names - they work for me) are THE best shampoos on the market for fragile hair. My hair isn't curly at all. It's SUPER fine, British, wispy, greasy overnight and lightened too, just to make the breakage issue even worse. These cleanse perfectly without constantly eating away at that poor little wispy cuticle. I'm sure they do a little bit, but my breakage is WAY lower when I stick to these with super strong thick conditioners afterwards and a little bit of keratin or silk protein from time to time. Oh, and a Hercules Sagemann comb. (Google this  - it's about 12 bucks and it glides through tangled hair without even one of those 'popping sounds which you know signals a hair breaking off half way down it's shaft.) But the shampoos - amazing.

Not sure about this shampoo. Smells funky and dries my hair out. Almost seems like it's like castile soap. I have used the Devacurl No Poo and had better results.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
DevaCurl has changed my relationship with my hair!  I have finer hair and this makes it difficult to use No-Poo very frequently.  No-Poo is a little too heavy for my hair texture.  Lo-Poo is perfect!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love this shampoo.  It's a little new not to have lather but it made an immediate diference in my curls.  The fragrance is very light and clean.  I chose the ""Low-Poo"" because I do Bikam's Yoga but I think I'll try the ""no-poo,"" as well.  Actually, I think I'll try several of the DevaCurl products.  I just couldn't be happier with this product.
"

Love this product
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I have wavy to straight hair and it loves this shampoo. More elasticity and shine than it has on shampoos with sulfates. Also, I am allergic to most fragrances (skin rashes) and have no problem with the wonderful essential oils Deva puts in the Low Poo. Highly recommend.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Love this stuff. Gets my curly hair clean without stripping it of oils. Took a week or two for my hair/scalp to adjust.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I have really curly hair, I've tried all shampoos and up until now I have never really loved any of them. Not until deva curl. It is amazing stuff. Very rich controls frizz, defines curls. Very affordable, smells great. They have lots of accessories but he shampoo and one condition conditioner is all I need to have AMAZING curls. Look up one of the Deva curl hair dressers for an amazing curly girl hair cut too!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Has completely saved my hair!
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I feel like this is conditioner, I love it. I am about to order my second bottle of low poo. My hair has never been better. I rarely have to use product to help with the frizz anymore. If I do I use moroccan oil on the ends. I often feel like I don't even need to use the conditioner after I use the Low Poo, it is that awesome. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a more gentle shampoo and has curly hair.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Been using low poo for years now.  I have 3B curls.  It smells great, doesn't dry out my curls, and does not leave icky residue.  It works well with One Condition.

"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love DevaCurl conditioner but am not crazy about the shampoo. It feels gooey, almost like it is leaving a film behind. For daily use, I prefer Wen. However, I give the DevaCurl conditioner 5 stars!!
"

I'm learning to use this correctly.  After years of using regular shampoo, this does not lather as I was used to and still cleans my hair. For the money I got a large supply.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
This entire product line is gentle and good for all hair types.  My daughter, son and I are completely happy with this product.  There is also a ""no-poo"" version... but his has absolutely NO suds and many folks like to feel the foamy action in the shower... but hair has never been healthier.

I'm a fan of Deva but the shampoos I can't do.  I used this for quite some time and my scalp started to itch quite a bit.  I finally stopped using it and my head felt so much better.  I still use all the other products I just use a different shampoo.

"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I live in a humid Florida environment, taming my curly hair has been a battle for most of my life (even in dry environments) until I discovered this product.  Thank you thank you thank you.I have thin curly hair (spirals), that seems to absorb up all the moisture I throw at it, and still manage to get frizzy, dry and unmanageable.  I've been researching products for the various hair types, specifically curly hair types and this product was amongst the recommendations.  I tried it, and have not gone back! Some of the reviews are correct, if you use too much of this product, or too often, you hair will have a greasy feel.  But what I've discovered, that since may hair absorbs so much moisture, this ""greasy feeling"" does not last long.  I must admit, it took me a while to get used to the ""no suds"" feeling of the shampoo, the thought that if there is `no suds' the hair must not be clean .  But my hair is shiny, soft and curly...beautiful from day 1 to the next.I have completely switched to the Deva Curl product line and am very satisfied with the outcome.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
No more, no less. It lathers up a bit as opposed to the No-Poo variety, but other than that, there's nothing notable about it. The scent is chemically, even though it does not contain the usual artificial chemicals most shampoos do, like sulfates and it gets your hair clean, no better or worse than any drugstore shampoo.If you want a more natural, sulfate-free shampoo, save the high price of this and go to a drugstore and read labels. There are a billion and one sulfate-free, chemical-free, moisturizing/smoothing shampoos out there for much, much less money that smell wonderful and do a great job. Burt's Bees and the Say Yes To...line of products are two examples.

Love this product. I have curly hair and most shampoos leave hair too dry.  This cleanses your hair without a lot of lather. Curly hair is dryer than straight hair, so us '"" curlys"" must always have alot of moisture in our hair so that our curls are defined and not frizzy.  This shampoo helps obtain the ritual that we follow.

This was upposed to be a new item but had clearly been used. This showed up with dried, brown gel coming out of the pump.  When I opened the bottle I found the same brown gel inside the tube. (See photo). Now I have to pay for a lable (no printer) and go to the UPS store which is owned by a jerk.  I went from super happy that this showed up so soon to disgusted and annoyed.  What a waste of time.

I can't get over how grateful I am to the hairstylist who recommended that I use a sulfate-free shampoo, particularly DevaCurl products, for my naturally curly, long hair (curl type 3b for those of you who know what that means).  Getting rid of sulfate-containing products has totally changed my hair and curls for the better - my hair is glossy, not as dry, not as frizzy, etc., etc... I can't recommend this product enough, honestly.  I use every other day with DevaCurl Mister Right in between washes to re-shape my curls.  This shampoo does a great job of cleaning my hair well without stripping it.  Bravo DevaCurl!

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I love this shampoo; my hair is naturally loosely curled.  I use about (the equivalent of) two teaspoons each time I wash my hair.  Even though it does not produce a ton of lather, it does clean well.  When done shampooing, my hair feels a bit ""slick"", not greasy, but like it has moisturizer on it.  For this reason I don't use a conditioner in the shower - I just make sure the shampoo is rinsed out well.  After I shampoo, I don't wrap my hair in a towel, I just blot it dry by scrunching the towel up towards my scalp.  I then use about a dime size portion of the Deva Curl B'Leave-In leave in conditioner, applying it while scrunching my hair.  This shampoo has a pleasant smell.

I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. I have to use this product because it is sulfa free and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product keeps my hair feeling clean all day.

Whether you are Male or Female, if you have Curly or Wavy hair you need to try this product.  I always had to use so much product to keep the frizz down with my curls.. then the product would weigh my hair down, making my curls look drab.  I started using Low Poo and One condition 2 years ago.  Now I only use scrunching foam when I want my curls to look fantastic..My husband starting using this product, after I read that Head and Shoulders causes receding hairline in Men.  Head and Shoulders made his hair so greasy his pillow case was always nasty.  Now he can go 2 days without shampooing and his hair looks great.Give it a try.

I couldn't deal with the No Poo version.  I crave suds and I found the No Poo to difficult to distribute through my long hair.  This Low Poo is the perfect alternative to regular shampoos which have high phosphate levels which dry out my curls.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Like this more than the no-poo - I need lather.  This has worked well for us and we like the smell.  Some people mentioned the feeling that you can't rinse it out, but this hasn't been a problem and to some extent it feels like it's protecting the delicate curly hair.  The combination of the low-poo and the one condition has been excellent.

Deva Curl product was doctor recommended. I have been using this for years and I love how well it works with my curly hair it makes it feel smooth and oh so soft. It’s a bit expensive but worth it. I am allergic to sulfa and Deva products are sulfa free. Deva works great for me!!!

My hair is thin and dried out and fragile and for years I've been damaging it with commercial shampoos. Then I found this shampoo at a local beauty products store, and after a week, my hair was glistening with moisture, it had darkened to its natural color, and it curled great. The only problem was that it was expensive. So I went to Amazon and found a large size at a much better cost. Yay

Over the last decade I've used a lot of different mom paraban/sulfate type of shampoos.  Some were amazing but discontinued. Some just didn't wash my hair or give my waves what they needed.  I finally decided to try the low poo out.  It was pretty great for about a week, I wash every other day.  By the end of the bottle my hair was both greasy after one day and dry on the ends.  I was thinking it was my conditioner since I use 2 repairing types at once and sometimes a hair oil on the ends. After just using one conditioner and no oil with the shampoo my hair was still feeling simultaneously greasy and dry.  I switched shampoos and my hair is back to clean, fluffy, and soft.  Not sure what happened to dry out my ends and not wash my scalp but this was not for me at all. And didn't do that much for my waves.

I love the product. But when I received the shampoo it was wrapped in a plastic. It had leaked & approximately 1/3 of the bottle had leaked out. After removing the plastic I figured out the lid was cracked & you can’t use it to pump the shampoo out. Very disappointed. These products are not cheap.

DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
First day after using this product and a DevaCurl Conditioner my hair turned extremely dry - by the end of the week, when I washed my hair - WAY too many strands came out. It was a little disconcerting to lose so much hair when I never had before, so I went back to my old shampoo and conditioner and sure enough - almost no hair loss during the wash and condition process. My hair hates something in this product.
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
Reading up on the product and the reviews I though this shampoo and the One Conditioner would work well for my hair. Unfortunately, it does not. I have been using it for 3 weeks and my hair has never felt greasier. It feels like the product is not rinsing out or like I haven't washed my hair in three weeks. It does enhance my curls but my hair feels disgusting. I'm bummed.

I have permed hair and used the No-Poo for my first go-round but it never really worked well with my extremely hard water.  This version, along with the conditioner, definitely makes my curls softer and less frizzy; and isn't that what all curly girls want?
"
DevaCurl Low Poo Mild Lather Cleanser; 32oz,"
I had to say I bought this product because of the great reviews here. I have fine,curly hair that is like of a 'cherub' or wavy curly depending on the day of the week.Anyway, I expected this product to remove more ""dirt"" or whatever (excess conditioner, hair gel, etc.) from my hair. It really felt great in the shower, like it wasn't stripping my hair of moisture, etc. and felt clean. I air-dried my hair and scrunched and tossled it to define curls and give it volume.Low Poo is really great for volume. I had loads of it after use. The draw back was that the ends of my hair were rough, dry and frizzy, wire-y. I really felt that either a) the product did not adequately wash out the gel in my hair from the previous day or b) there is actually hair gel in the shampoo to give the hair definition. Probably great for someone with thicker hair.I will keep experimenting but in the meantime (and could be user error) I will keep using my clarifying shampoo to wash out the excess conditioner and hair gel. Having fine curly hair is a constant battle against limp lifeless hair and dry frizz, and my curls do not look near as shiny and healthy after a good clarifying shampoo every other day. The drawback of that is that I notice more hair in the drain and would like to stop damaging my hair. The No-poo is great but this also builds up over time.

I washed my hair for YEARS with regular shampoo - and fought the frizz that resulted from the drying effects of sulfates.  No-Poo is different!  It cleans just the right amount and leaves hair feeling silky (rather than straw-like) when it is rinsed.  I will never use anything else on my hair.  Just say no to lather!

Let me start out by saying I LOVE the no poo shampoo, but this stuff doesn't clean at all.Well it did wash out the the angel gel that was in my hair but the next day my hair smelled like sheep or cheese .. what ever your hair smells like when its dirty it will smell like that the next day. with the no poo shampoo I can last up to 3 days with out having to wash my hair again. With this stuff i can't last more than 8 hrs and that's in 65 degree weather.

I admit I was skeptical to try this.  I read some mixed reviews about it drying out the hair after use.  I needed to try something as my hair has been acting strange lately.  The curl pattern was getting tighter, stringy looking and I had build up on my hair from experimenting with some Ouidad & Wetline hair gel products.  I kept reading in the good reviews that it really revitalized curls and made them light and bouncy again so decided to order it.  I dispensed the product directly against my scalp as they instruct and used enough to bring the liquid level down to right above the top of the label if that makes sense.  I used my fingertips to massage it in.  It has a thick gel like consistency and it lathers slightly.  The smell is good and not too strong.  After massaging it into my scalp I used my wetbrush to gently comb through the end of my hair and up to my scalp to make sure the product was worked though and my hair was detangled.  I followed with my Deva Curl One Condition which I left on until the end of my shower.  Sure enough, my curls were revitalized, clumped in bigger curls like before, the tightness was gone and my hair was very soft and light feeling.  I did not experience any of the dryness that others mentioned in their reviews.  I plan to use this about every two weeks or more if I feel my hair needs it sooner.

I have mostly wavy hair that gets definite curl when I use a diffuser. Because of that, I need to keep my hair clear of as much product as possible but I hate shampooing more than once or twice a week because I want to keep all the moisture that I can. This was a great alternative to ""reset""  my hair every 2-3 weeks. It definitely brings the curl back by clearing away any heavy product. It also smells fantastic, I love walking around the day that I use it and enjoying the scent.  Definitely worth the purchase.

This was so soothing on my scalp. I struggle with a dry itchy scalp and this has helped immensely. The nozzle helps to get through my thick 3a/3b hair and I noticed an immediate difference in my hair afterwards. It almost has a cooling sensation that makes your hair feel refreshed and clean. It was like an ACV rinse without the nasty smell lol. It does give a deep clean but my hair didn't feel stripped or overly dry so it seems to work really well for me!

Since I began using all Deva products, my curls have never looked better. However, those of us in the silver sisterhood have an additional issue... product buildup can give silver or white hair a yellowish tinge. And since my curls can look great for four days between cleansings with nothing but a water spritz and a bit of gel, even an occasional use of non-Deva  purple shampoo wasn't fixing the yellow caused by buildup. I was sceptical, I have no idea what ""micellar"" is, but Buildup Buster works!  A weekly use, followed by one of the Deva treatment products has my silver sparkling and my hair isn't dry at all.

I'm sorry I have to say this- but it actually PUT buildup in my hair that I can't get out. I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed my hair again, and even now there is STILL sticky product coating my hair strands making it greasy and clumpy. When I touch my hair, my fingers are sticky. It's like I can't get this stuff off for the life of me. I bought it and had a friend bring it to me because of the hard water in south east asia, and now I'm afraid I won't find another product here to be able to undo the huge mess this product made.

Update 8/19/18:Due to the cost of this product, I wasn’t willing to allow it just one application.Yesterday, I used it again, but instead of applying deep conditioner and rinsing it out immediately, I used the same deep conditioner for 20 minutes. Problem solved. I changed my rating from 1 star.This product was horrible for my hair. Made it feel like straw even after applying a deep conditioner. I never get tangles combing out my hair. After applying this product and conditioner, I couldn't get my wide-tooth comb through my hair. This is the first time my hair felt like straw while it was still wet. I listened to a lot of reviews on YouTube before I purchased this product. It seems to work well for black women but it didn't work for this white woman. Since there wasn't a seal over the opening, I have my doubts that this product is authentic.

I heard about this product just as it was being launched. It's a hallelujah type product that will remove excess product buildup on hair and on scalp. It does take some time to learn how to use this. You should  allow for that learning curve because the tip of the bottle isn't quite long enough to section hair out  and it does require squeezing the bottle  pretty substantially to get the liquid to come out.  Note that you should allow at least 20 minutes for application depending on hair length. Also there is a waiting time for it to be on hair and scalp before it is rinsed off.It does a great job though and doesn't strip hair.

I’m super impressed with this product! Living in Florida I have found that gel is the best way for my curls to be in ringlets instead of frizzy due to the humidity. But because I use so many products in hair, I have noticed a lot of build up. At first I thought it was the gel “flaking” off, then I thought I might have dandruff but after some research I decided to try this buildup buster. Holy moly does it work! After the 1st use I noticed a 100% difference! The flakes were gone! I have used it twice now and still love it! Definitely a must in your hair care routine!

I think this is a good product. It really does clean the scalp well. My only issue is that I feel like I have to use a ton of it to really get my entire scalp clean.I bought this because I had severe build-up from a vacation where I forgot some of my products. My hair felt miserable and was gross—this really did help make my scalp feel super clean without being incredibly dry.This product doesn’t lather much because it doesn’t rely on sulfates (that’s totally fine!), but I have thick hair and it can be somewhat difficult and product consuming to get it evenly over my scalp. I think it’s a nice product and may work for others, but instead of purchasing this I’d rather buy a clarifying shampoo instead, especially for this price where I can get more for my money.

I love this stuff!I use it to remove mineral build up from well water so my color takes more evenly.I was using another brand. But my curly hair was not a fan of it. It seemed very harsh, and made it extremely difficult to comb thru while the product was in or after. Came as a powder in packets. Never felt I had enough.Thus smells great is easy to apply and comb and my color is taking better than it has in a very long time. Will continue to use. Highly recommend!

Sadly this product didn't work for my curl pattern (3b) and I returned it. Instead of removing the buildup in my hair it actually ADDED more buildup. Leaving my hair feel greasy or as if I put gel all over. So if your curl pattern is 3a-3c then it may not work. If you need a visual for 3a-3c curl patterns just google it :)

I was on the fence about whether to get this because of the price, but I'm glad I did! I have 2b/2c hair. For the past few weeks, I kept having bad hair days with frizz and stretched-out waves. I thought a trim would fix it, but it didn't. Finally, I used this and WOW! My hair looks amazing, it's soft, shiny, and the waves are not stretched out anymore. I even have some spirals! For reference, I used this in place of my shampoo, then conditioned with Cantu conditioner, and scrunched with Shea Moisture curling gel souffle.

I thought I was going to enjoy this product because of the great reviews. The scent is awful, smells like flea and tick shampoo to me. It did cleanse my scalp but the thought of massaging these ingredients into my scalp was horrible every time. I figured since I spent about $20 on it mine as well use it, but my health is worth way more than a clarifying shampoo. In this society where our bodies are constantly bombarded by toxins in the air, water, and foods we eat. The last thing we need is a hair product with carcinogenic, hormone distributing chemicals massaged into our bodies. Be mindful!

Love this!  Was nervous about negative reviews but my experience was just what I hoped.  Used it once and my hair feels soft and cleaner than it has in ages. Worked into scalp then through hair.  Followed with Deva Curl conditioner and gel, as usual.  Hair livelier than it has been in ages with no sense of build up.  Perfect.

Before you purchase this product look into the current class action lawsuit against Deva Curl regarding ALL of their products. Save yourself the  heartache, hair loss and damage. Take 5 min to look on YouTube to see what is happening to other users.

This is not something to use every time I shampoo - I think it would dry out my hair. But it’s great for cleaning off all build-up of styling products, really does the trick. I only use it about every 5th or 6th time I wash my hair (which is thick and curly)

Not a fan. It makes my scalp greasy (when other cleanser shampoos do not).

I recently tried the build up buster for the first time on my own after visiting a professional curly girl salon. I love the way it cleanses my scalp and hair without stripping all of the moisture. The smell is nice (in a kind of tropical lemonny way). I liked the performance of the cleanser so much I purchased the larger size the 2nd time. The cost for the 8oz is quite expensive so it made more sense to go larger and get more product.

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I really do like this. I use it once a month maybe twice. It really gets my scalp clean and fresh. Since I cowash my hair 2 times a week at most during winter less. Therefore the Deva buildup buster is good to get my hair ready for the next round.

I love this stuff. I had not realized how dull and lifeless product build up was making my hair.  I rarely use the No Poo anymore.  This is so much better!

My Deva stylist recommended this for my hair to give it a nice refresh. After using a sample I ordered an entire bottle. This is great to use either once a week or once a month to get rid of build up and refresh your curls.  I also use it once a month on my daughters hair and it helps perk her curl back up.

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
Wow. I have my old hair back!  I’m glad that I read the reviews and tips. My hair felt like straw after washing so I packed on the conditioner and used a wide tooth comb in the shower. My hair now has defined waves and curls.

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
Let me preface this by saying I almost never write review, but this product is so magical I had to share its merits to all the curly girls (or guys!) out there who are frustrated by the state of their hair. Where I live, we have exceptionally hard water and cold dry winters. That combined with near daily product use, my hair was flat and curls out of sorts. Today? I feel like a curl goddess! Life has been thrown back into my curls, they’re soft/bouncy and they just look so much better! Additionally, i did NOT feel like this product “striped” my hair like other clarifying products do. For reference, I have finer hair and 3B curls.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
This is useful in removing build-up, but I think I’d prefer a clarifying shampoo. I have naturally 3c curly/coily hair, and this product does not create enough slip to fee like I’m spreading it thoroughly to each strand. Afterward my hair has that squeaky clean feel, so it definitely gets the job done.

I think this is a great clarifying wash to remove buildup, I use it once a week and follow with melt into moisture. You have to use quite a lot though (I do have long hair). I also know that there's a lot of DevaCurl ripoffs on Amazon, but this is the real deal!

This works GREAT! Didn’t realize I had build up until I used this. My hair felt different right after my first use. No regrets here! The bottle is a good size to hold in the shower (not bulky).
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
Clarifying is a must for curlies because residue means flat, greasy, frizzy curls, but it's a tradeoff because of the moisture stripping action of clarifying shampoos. Buildup Buster removes every molecule of buildup without removing the slightest bit of moisture. My hair is left soft, shiny and extra bouncy. Also, you shouldn't need to clarify all that often, so this will last you a good, long while.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
Its okay, but its so thick that its hard to get it out of the bottle. This is a super thick shampoo with a good scent, cleanses well. I will not repurchase, though because its expensive and their are other shampoos that work just as well if not better.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I’ve found that DevaCurl products are kind of hit or miss. This one is a miss. It did not help with my buildup and all, and instead made my scalp super oily.

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I had high hopes for this stuff! However, I don't feel like it gets my scalp or hair that clean. I normally have to wash my scalp with shampoo twice a week otherwise it gets itchy, and if I use this in place of shampoo, my scalp gets itchy within a day. It smells nice, my hair always seems to be nice and soft, and it has great slip, but it is not clarifying enough to use for my scalp.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
Not a good product if you have hard water. Made it waaaaaay worse. Beside this, I usually love all the deva products.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
This stuff works pretty well. It sort of helped my dandruff. My curls definitely don't feel quite as filmy. With the deva curl system this product is a must have because you will eventually get a lot of build up. I'm surprised they didn't come out with it sooner.

Okay I don't ever write reviews but after one use this product did magic to my thin 3B curls. I only use a cleanser twice a week because I get bad build up and my curls look blah. Well before his product I used redkin basic cleanser and it would strip my curls dry. After one use this product brought life to my curls they are light bouncy and VERY VERY SOFT. I followed with the deva curl conditioner and sprayed some deva curl set it free spray and damn to my curls look good. Would recommend this to anyone with thin curls that need a cleanser that doesn't strip.

I use DevaCurl products regularly, so when the Buildup Buster came out, I immediately got it. I've never been disappointed in any DC products I've used...until now.  The hype grossly exaggerates this product's actual performance. I've used this product a few times, and I honestly cannot feel or see any difference in my 2c/3a curls, except dryness. I used Heaven in a Jar to condition, but I still didn't like the way my hair felt or moved after using the Buildup Buster. I won't be repurchasing it.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I wasn't sure that I needed this, but I've been using the deva line for ages so I thought I'd give it a try. I often use whatever moisturizing thing I can get my hands on to tame frizz in my hair. Yes, this includes hand lotion in a pinch... don't judge. In retrospect, I think I really REALLY needed it. Once I was in the shower with wet hair, I had to apply it and rinse it three or four times before it finally lathered and rinsed clean. The first two tries didn't really result in that squeaky clean feeling. After the second wash I was doubting that it would work at all. Finally it started to lather up a bit and I could feel the sections of my hair that still needed extra cleansing. When I was satisfied that the product had actually busted the buildup, I conditioned with One Condition and styled with BeLeave In Curl Boost and Volumizer. My hair looks amazing. It's super soft and shiny, my curls are bouncy and thick, and even the color is better. I'm definitely holding on to this new cleansing product.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
As a curly hair owner I totally recommend this product. I used yesterday and the experience was amazing. I was a bit about the price but it is totally worth it. Some people here are saying that better use the Suave brand. I was excited to try the Suave brand because of the good reviews and price obviously but when I read it has sulfate in it was a bit turn off. So definitely I'm sticking with this one for sure.

I have been a religious follower of the curly girl method upon discovering it on reddit and it has been a god send to my curls making me love them again. I recently moved to an area with significantly harder water than where I was previously living and it seemed like all hope had been lost. Then I read about this buildup buster and decided to try it out.To wash:- I wash my hair every other day or just about, sometimes I will push it to three days.- Shampoo - SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo- Conditioner - SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Conditionerabout once a week:- DevaCurl Buildup Buster in place of shampooand on another day of the week- Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner and leave it in for 15 minutes before rising it outTo style:- Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner about a dime size on damp hair- Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie- Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Hold & Shine Daily Moisture Mistif I wash my hair late at night I will plop it in an old tee shirt for the night and that is it. My hair has literally never had more life and moisture in it. It feels so unbelievably soft. Big fan of this build up buster and will be repurchasing in the future.

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I detest DevaCurl products pretty much across the board. I think they are over priced, over hyped and under performing. When I first went to a DevaCurl salon, the stylist pushed over $150 worth of products, including this, on me and insisted that using the products was the ONLY way I would be able to maintain my DevaCut. Well, the cut was atrocious as was her personality and advice. All bulls*it. The cut was basically her shearing a few inches straight across the bottom of my hair, snipping the scissors around my head and loading my hair up with so many things that I could not get my fingers through it the next day. In addition, the products made my scalp itch and flake.A year later, after finding, using and thoroughly enjoying the InnerSense line, I found another DevaCurl salon that did not push the Deva line on customers. My hair was dry and the stylist at the new salon suggested I NOT co-wash every time I showered as even conditioner builds up on hair and can negatively effect curl pattern. She recommended the BuildUp Buster but did not insist I purchase it. When I got home, I discovered I had some unopened from the huge product purchase at the first DevaCurl salon.About a month after this haircut, I decided to try the BuildUp Buster since I use the InnerSense products nearly every day and also because I live in a hard water area and my silver hair is discolored from the minerals in the water.This is easy and pleasant to use, the scent is citrusy and it rinsed out very easily. I used a conditioning hair masque after and since I was home and had no plans for the day, just let my hair air dry with no other product in it. My curls were shiny, bouncy and springy, no frizz but also no change in the discoloration from the hard water. I think that is something I am just going to have to live with.I use BuildUp Buster every 4 to 6 weeks and find it really does remove excessive product from my curls and brings them back to life. How nice to find at least one DevaCurl product that does what it's supposed to do!

I have kinky/coily Afro hair. Supposedly one of the targets for devacurl products. Alas...I have NO idea why this happened, but when I used this product, it literally matted my hair. I was in the shower and could feel my hair matting up right away! I attempted to rinse it out, but it wouldn’t come out as it was still in the matted hair. I was HORRIFIED! I rinsed many times in an attempt to get it all out.Sad part, my hair matted so badly that I had to (insert intense sobbing) cut my hair. I mean, think of a dog that hasn’t been groomed in a year. I had THICK matted hair 😭 Well, my sister came down and cut out the matted hair for me. If you are a black woman with natural hair, you know how traumatic this was. I went from shoulder length twists one day to about 2 inches of hair, which I’m thankfully able to flat twist (but that’s about it for me until it grows more).The irony is that I purchased it to HELP my hair. I still need to contact the company. It’s been like 3 weeks now and I’m almost to the point where I’ve come to terms with what happened. I worked so hard for my hair.*** Here's the response I received from DevaCurl...Elicia G (Devacurl.com)Jan 17, 13:55 ESTHi Ardra,Thank you for contacting DevaCurl. My name is Elicia, and I am happy to assist you.I am so sorry to hear that Buildup Buster wasn't a great option for your hair.  I will forward your feedback to the Product Development team, as they need to see that this is something that our customers and clients are experiencing.I can say that with Buildup Buster, since it is so potent, it can have this affect if you apply it more than once. You can only use it one application per week.Thank you for choosing DevaCurl. Have a great weekend.Sincerely,Elicia

I love this shampoo! It gets my hair so clean and soft and keeps my hair so lovely for 3 days. I usually use it 1-2 times a week and mix it with my dandruff shampoo. A little goes a long way and I've been using the same 8oz bottle for 8 months. When my stylist used it on my hair, I just had to have a bottle because it gets my hair so clean and keeps it bouncy. We have hard water where we live, and I use a pretty heavy gel, and it gets everything out. It doesn't lather like a normal shampoo, but I promise it still gets your hair clean, because it makes my hair feel like silk when I'm rinsing it out. I don't have color-treated hair, so I'm not sure how it would work with that though.

If you have curly hair and use mouse or gel (or any hair products really) other than oils, YOU NEED THIS. Restored my hair completely by getting rid of all the junky product build up. I use weekly to keep my hair from feeling heavy. I watched YouTube videos on Deva curl styling gel, and this product was included. Couldn’t make myself pay over $40 in Ulta. Amazon saved me!

All I can say is this stuff really works. I use it, as well as my daughter, when we need an “extra cleansing”, and our hair literally feels sqeaky clean. The consistency is just like a serum. I do not use it once a week as suggested on the bottle, as I think it would be too drying for my hair. I can usually get away with using it every 3-4 weeks.

Awhile back I felt my hair was becoming increasingly dry and brittle. I was starting to have some hair fallout as well. A friend recommended DevaCurl products to me, including this Buildup Buster Micellar Water. I'm really starting to see improvements in my hair. I love how clean this makes my hair feel. It's simple to use, I use it just 2-3 times weekly in the shower.

I tried the build up buster after hearing it could help revive your curls if they are weighed down by build up...whoa was i wrong. I have waist length hair and a some of it just dried out and broke off and i have weird layers under my hair now.  when i used it, it wouldnt comb out no matter how much conditioner i used. anyway, i have a lot of short pieces where there is more strain to my hair and a lot more split ends... which sounds crazy but it really weakened it.  It really feels like chemicals stripped my hair, and also, my curls seem straighter and frizzier. Very disappointed. I feel like this ruined my hair.

My scalp will occasionally get a bit dry and/or seem to have some build up when I only use Deva Curl Conditioning Cleanser. I need something occasionally that I can rub into my scalp and get it cleaner. This does the trick. I use this probably every third time I wash my hair (which I do every other day, maybe every 3 days). It keeps my scalp very clean! The nozzle also makes it easy to apply the product directly onto the scalp between your hair.

This DevaCurl Buildup Buster smells wonderful! It seems to work well, although I've heeded the advice of using it weekly (NOT daily) as it may have a tendency to dry out your hair.The container has a cap that doubles as the applicator: you're supposed to direct the product at the roots, work it in, then rinse letting the rest of the hair get a somewhat diluted amount of Buildup Buster.I like the product because I tend to apply multiple DevaCurl products, layered and Buildup Buster seems to give my hair a ""clean slate"" especially in the summer humidity when I tend to retouch more often and create a build up.

I have semi curly, wavy hair that is also blonde. I was hoping this would help pull some of the hard water buildup out of my hair. I read the reviews and had high hopes, but it didn't seem to do that much. It doesn't bubble up either, so I feel like I have to use a lot for my thick hair. It's a nice shampoo, but not the the price, especially since there wasn't even a noticeable difference with my curls.

Very happy with this purchase. Not only is it cheaper than on the website, it works well and came quickly. I was worried because there was about an ounce missing, but they gave me a partial refund. I was assured it was authentic, and overall I'm very happy with this.  Will purchase again!

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I like how my hair looks on the days I use this, and the smell for me is really nice and not overpowering. I used it a few days in a row and I think it was too much for my hair so I use it as recommended now which is less frequently. I am trying some normal shampoo now so I don't know if I will be buying this again but will see!

This product worked very well, i have curly hair and I noticed some product build up even after washing my hair with shampoo, once I used this all over my hair it had a nice slick to it didn’t feel harsh on my hair. I get build up mostly in the back of my scalp and when I was done washing my hair I didn’t feel  any build up, no flakeyness nothing it felt so clean! Will be buying more once I’m done with this bottle!

I was skeptical of this product because I've never used any clarifying shampoo that worked nearly as well as Neutrogena clarifying does. Hey, guess what - DevaCurl Build Up Buster is excellent! It de-gunks my hair without drying it out or stripping the color. I recommend.

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
Was looking forward to using this product. I’m a huge fan of Deva but not this one unfortunately. This left my hair feeling very dried out. I was really surprised. I read this before I purchased this but everyone’s experience is different but not for me. I’ll stick to Mop Top
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
It a shampoo to clarify and remove product so moisturizing is not what it’s for.  The scent is fine, the price is ridiculous, but I’m regrowing my curls out and don’t want to use a shampoo not meant for curls.  It does the job and doesn’t strip my scalp and leaves my curls looking good.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
My fellow curl girlfriend recommended a cleanser. My scalp was itchy, my hair felt weighed down and my hair was frizzy. When I used this product, it was an instant success. I was skeptical at first because I didn't want a cleanser that stripped my hair of moisture or oils. I've trusted Deva products before though and this one did not disappoint!
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
This is great for removing product build up from your hair. I use it about once a month when my hair feels like it’s gotten kind of gunky.  I follow it with a deep conditioner and then my hair feels really clean and refreshed.  Just don’t over use it as over use will strip your hair

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
This product works.  My hair gets curlier every time I use it. It does seem somewhat harsh though.  I use conditioners only to wash and this seems like a rather harsh shampoo.  I use once every six washes so I cut down on the stripping nature of the product - which is its intention to get build up and hard water residue out.  I recommend it with that caution.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
Smells amazing and works great! I have very thick wavy middle eastern hair and after years of dying, treatments, and products this did the trick! I’ve tried other clarifying products and they dried out my hair really bad. DC booster left my hair luxurious and restored.

I love Devacurl and their products have rejuvenated my curls so I was so excited to try this product, especially after seeing all the raves reviews.  It makes me wonder if people really do like it or if it's just all hype because I literally saw no difference in my hair. My curls didn't ""bounce back"" nor did it feel like it clarified much of anything. Perhaps I don't have as much buildup as everyone else? I'm not really sure. I applied it as directed, which is super easy to do as the little pointed spout really helps target the scalp. The liquid itself is thick and takes some time to work into the hair/scalp. It smells great as most Devacurl products do. It just didn't seem to work for me. For reference, I have 2c/3a fine/normal waves/curls.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I'm so confused by all the glowing reviews for this product. I was so excited to try it, but it has not met ANY of my expectations for a ""buildup buster"". I've tried using it several times now, with the hope that I can make it work for me, but every time it fails: my hair is heavy and weighed down, greasy (especially the roots), stringy, zero body, and it takes forever to dry. Ironically, it feels dirtier than ever, and I need something to washout the massive buildup this leaves behind. I massage it in and then spend ages trying to make sure it's rinsed out, but nothing works. My hair is normally wavy in the drier months, very curly in the more humid months, thick, and with lots of natural body, for reference. Clearly, I'm the lone dissenter here (though there are other reviews outside this site with similar experiences), and I just don't get it. There's none of the ""lightness"" or ""bounce"" that others have described, and my curls are less defined than ever...flatter than flat. I love all my other DevaCurl products, which I use regularly, but I just can't get behind this one. Going into the trash and will never be repurchased.

I have lost tons of hair and length using Devacurl products. It fried my super long curly hair so badly and the company won’t reply to me about it. I’ve had approx 8-10 inches in places just break off. My hair is absolutely ruined. Unbelievable :-/ very sad and distrought.Beware if you have very long colored or fragile hair.

"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I LOVE this! I've been using only Deva Curl products for a year now and when this came out I had to try it. I use a lot of leave in Set it Free, their gels and creams, etc daily and at first when I used it I thought I'd have a horrible hair day... Nope! My hair air dried so nice and wavy and it smells AMAZING. Even my husband commented on my ""new"" smell. I don't think it smells citrusy one bit like the other reviewer said.
"
"Devacurl Buildup Buster Hair Cleanser, 8oz","
I suffer from scalp build up/dandruff/psoriasis and this saved my life. I have natural straight fine/thin hair, but a lot of it and this product works perfect for my hair type. I got a perm 5 months ago that has definitely went away, but everytime I use this I feel like I get some of that perm bounce and curliness back. My scalp loves me after I use this. I would be careful about using this more than a few times per week as it can be somewhat stripping if you're not moisturizing afterwards. Thanks DevaCurl.

DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. I have gotten this product from Amazon for over five years and it has worked great, and this is the first time I received a watered down product. It’s literally white water. This is not Set It Free. The real deal is much thicker consistency. I am so angry.

I've also used it while my hair is wet, but if you do that, your hair will get a little hard/crunchy.The bottle is a good size and the sprayer works well, so you don't have to pump it too many times to get decent coverage.I've used this spray when I wake up, but don't want to wash my hair. We all know what curly hair can look like when we wake up....and this product will help bring curls back to life and reduce the mad scientist look that I wake up with.Some local salons sell this product, but it is much more expensive to purchase at a salon.

Use just a little bit of spray on the middle to bottom of damp hair, then scrunch up from the bottoms of your hair and air dry. Warning: if you spray too much, your hair WILL get crunchy and heavy. I have very thick, wavy to curly hair and I use 1-2 sprays per side of my head, then scrunch and sometimes dry it with my towel. If you feel like you sprayed too much, wet your hair a little to make it less strong!

This is exactly what I need when my hair isn't fluffed after I blow-dry it.  I turn upside down and spray the underside of my hair and then fluff with my hands and it stays the way I have put it then.  It works beautifully, and I know that this is a product I will always need to keep on hand.

Great product!  My daughter has extremely curly/frizzy hair.  This product allows the curls to come back together.  She's 6 years old and extremely active so it probably has a 6-8 hr hold before she begins frizzing out again through outside playing and so forth.  My only complaint is that it doesn't hold longer.  I wish it were slightly more stiff.......just personal preference....but a good product regardless.

Deva ""Set It Free"" is a product I can't be without and the 2 bottle set was an excellent buy on Amazon. I always get good results when I  apply Set It Free to my hair as a finishing product.

I also use the spray on dry hair it to touch up her hair before school. Just spray and use hands to tame frizz down. Go Deva if you have curly hair-it works!!

"

Deva Curl Moisture Lock Set it free is a must for Diva's with curls. The trick to this product is less is more and water. You need to spray hair with water before and after use. If you use too much your hair will become sticky. Also don't mix too many other products with this especially if they are oil based. Now mind you this stuff ain't cheap but (it is well worth it) if you use the same amount as a salon does (2-3 pumps over entire head) you will get the same results as your stylist. Good luck.

I used to be a regular client at the DevaChan NYC Salon and have been using their products for years. Set It Free is like a leave in conditioner that helps keep your hair from frizzing.

DevaChan has youtube.com videos demonstrating the correct usage of their products, pretty helpful.

This is awesome and highly recommend to set your curls wet as you wash your wash before putting curl frene or gel.

Watered down! Might be in the same bottle, but definitely not the same product.... seems easy to split the bottle and add water...
"

The scent is wonderful, and the product does a great job of refreshing my curly hair. I give it 3-stars because it leaves a waxy residue. This product is good for a one-day refresh, but not to refresh your hair for several days between washes.

This product has made my curls look amazing!  I have heard about it for years, and finally gave in to it.  I have no regrets, although it is pricey it is well worth it.  Can't use any other product in my hair.
"

Love Deva Curl products - this particular one is great for fine hair. I use this alone with a pump of the styling creme. Check out their web site for styling tip videos. I went from a short style blow dry to a curly girl and I'm loving it.

I wish DevaCurl wasn’t as pricey but it’s the only thing that makes my curls last and not frizz

This stuff smells like bug spray and dried out my hair. I used it several times in several manners; wet, damp, and dry hair. No matter how I used it my hair ended up way more dry and frizzy than using it without.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
This product tames down my frizzes and makes my hair more manageable.  I love the smell!  I do warn if you use this product a little to much it can make your hair feel greasy, a trial and error type of thing.

Purchased this based on the 30 plus 5 star reviews.I have tried several Deva Curl products and LOVE them. This one....I regret the purchase. I bought it as a 2-pack and have used roughly over 1/5 of it(6oz)...both spray nozzles spray in a ""v"" form and not effective to application of hair. Afterwards, the feeling it leaves on my hair is tacky,""dirty"" need to wash my hair feeling! so disappointed. All other Deva curl products never left my hair feeling anything but clean & wonderfully scented. As far as the ""enhance curls"" goes I didn't notice anything different than when I simply spray a little water on my hair to rejuvenate curl. Also can't comment in the ""moisture lock or no frizz"" it claims. Unfortunately for me I have waited past the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with a product I won't use at a $30.00 investment.Sorry, but this product does not warrant a positive review in my opinion.

DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I have 4b African American natural hair and I love this product on my hair.  So far I have used it for wet setting.  Based on others reviews, I made sure I first applied my leave in for moisture, then castor oil and shea butter to seal that moisture in.  Then the Set it Free.  The product seems to prvent frizz, which I didn't even think I had any.  My hair also seems softer and has a sheen.  But maybe it's because it's not as frizzy.  I used it for twists.  Finally I have a staple product!
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
This keeps my frizz tamed, and I do find it works for about 48 hours. Beyond that, a couple of sprays in the palm scrunched into my frizzy areas keeps it going.
"

Arrived on time. I love this product. It really works for my fine curly hair.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I bought this based on the recommendations I read on [...]I hate to say it but I was disappointed in this product. It did not really reduce frizz and when used on dry hair it actually created frizz. It also leaves a residue on my hair which is not at all nice. I now have two bottles of this that I probably won't use and it wasn't cheap.I've used the Deva Care and Deva Curl One conditioners and I really like both of those products. But everything else I've tried from this company has not worked out for me. I have 3b/c hair by the way.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I use this immediately out of the shower, but it's also a great mid-day spray.  Not too sticky, it's just right.

"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I've used this for years and it's been great but this product now has a different smell (used to be citrus fresh, now I don't know what it is but I don't like it at all) and seems to be a different formula - much heavier and makes my hair stiff. Sad about this purchase.

Horrible!! Totally fake and not a real Deva product
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I have been using the Devacare and Devacurl products for the last five years. My curls are plentiful though hair is fine, and my hair has never looked better than when I'm using Deva products. Right out of the shower, I scrunch my wet hair with paper towels, apply Arc Angell and Set It Free, scrunch a little more, then wait for it to dry. The Set It Free has cured me of that gel-dried-to-crunchiness issue (which is fantastic, as that is not my best look). I've never applied it on my hair while it's dry so haven't a clue what the effect would be if I did.
"

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I love their products; and I bought two bottle of the ""Set it free"" hair products. I order packages all the time to my building complex and for some strange reason the package was denied. I e-mailed them and I was told that once they got the shipment back, they would e-mail me on how to proceed. NOW they are telling me there is NO way they can send my package and they told me they paid for shipping and handling. Last time I checked, I PAID SHIPPING AND HANDLING. They didn't even reach out to ask if they could help me, just shut me down and refunded my $26.00 without shipping and handling. I love their products but after this experience, I'd rather make my own leave in conditioner with conditioner and water.

"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I love Diva Curl styling products. I have long hair that has curl to it but it needs product to bring the curls out and hold them. All of the Diva style products do this for me and Set it Free is the icing on the cake and pumps up the curl and holds it.  I put in Diva gel scrunch the curls and then let it dry a bit and then add Set It Free and wow ! Beautiful loose curls!!  I am super anal anout product and picky. I highly recomend Diva !!!
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
Set It Free is part of a system from Deva Curl. I do not use the entire system however Set It Free remains a part of my hair routine. The secret to using most curl products is to apply them to wet hair. Immediately after hair washing I remove very little water from my hair. Absolutely no twisting the hair up in a towel. I also use a microfiber towel. I do not comb my hair what so ever. Then I apply a curl leave in conditioner or light non silicone frizz control product. I next apply a gel. Once again, no silicones or alcohols in the gel. Next comes the Set It Free. I am fairly liberal with the amount but I have a very thick head of hair. The water I initially left in my hair really helps to move all these products around throughout my hair. Once all these products are applied, I scrunch my hair from end up to my roots. I even turn my head upside down and keep the scrunching process going. I use to the diffuser attachment for drying my hair. I lay my hair on top of the diffuser and move the diffuser towards my scalp. I hold it in the same position for a good amount of time. I keep moving it all around my head until it feel closer to damp. This process creates a ""set"" to the waves. I have tried this process without the Set It Free and I don't get the same curl separation or frizz control. Day 2, 3 and even 4 days after the hair washing I will use a spray bottle to apply water to my locks. Sometimes I add more Set It Free on non-shampoo days. I use the diffuser each time and it recreates that great curl separation. It has taken me about 1.5 years to get this system figured out. The key to the success is to have really wet hair to start the product application, not to manipulate the hair too much with my hands and to leave the hair alone until it is completely dry. Set It Free is worth a try. Just understand it is trial and error until you get it right.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I've had ""Set it Free"" for a couple of years but didn't see any benefit and stopped using it.  I'm not happy with either Angel or ArcAngel in my very fine, frizzy hair, especially after the first day. I try not to wash my hair every day, just wet it. I've tried so many anti frizz products I could open a store, but yesterday I decided to try something different and sprayed Set it Free on wet, freshly washed and conditioned hair and it worked great. It still looked good today with just a little attention. I like Deva shampoos and conditioner, just didn't like the finishing products. I have a hair stylist who follows the Deva cutting method and uses her products and when she does it it looks good but I don't have the patience to spend the amount of time she does on a daily basis.  My hair got curlier during menopause although I still have areas that aren't as curly as others, and I now color it which has changed the texture and I just can't style it the way I used to. this has been a real challenge for me, the gel makes me look like a poodle .Lots of products in my hair makes it look awful. If anyone has any further suggestions I'd love to hear them.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I'm kind of floored by the negative reviews on this product, because I LOVE it.  For the first time in my life, my curly hair looks lush and frizz free.  I couldn't be happier.  I love the Devacurl products.  I use Devacurl Nopoo, Conditioner, Angell, and finish with the Set It Free.  My hair looks amazing!  All of the products smell great.  The only downside is the cost.  I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to spending money on beauty products, but this is my splurge.  I highly recommend giving them a try.  Maybe they aren't working for the other curlies, because they have not read the ""Curly Girl"" book that tells you how to apply the products and style your hair the ""curly girl"" way.  All I know is that my hair loves this stuff!
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
Deva Curl Moisture Lock came as a free sample with my Deva Curl diffuser.  I am so glad I didn't buy this stuff and can't wait to wash it out of my hair!!  It feels sticky and seems to create frizz.  I have tried a lot Deva Curl products which I love.  This one not at all!

DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
This spray works great to put on your hair before or after blow drying to keep moisture in. I do have to be careful not to use too much, or it makes my hair feel gummy. I know some people spray it in their hands to apply but, I find it easier to hold the bottle atleast a foot away from my head and spray the product. I notice a definite difference in terms of frizz with the dry winter air at the end of the day if I do not use it.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
When bought elsewhere this is a great product. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing. I received a watered down version in a dirty bottle and no cap.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
Took a gamble on this product. But very moisturizing on my 4c, loo porosity hair. Very light weight for daily or every other day usage. I spray all over my hair after washing and conditioning with Deva C products, b leave in, and ultra gel. Good for adding extra moisture in the winter regimen. Sometimes I spray this on at night  and use the baggy method. Hair is soft the next day.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
This initially seemed to work well, but I noticed every time I used it my hair started to look frizzy and feel brittle. It made my hair incredibly dry and the buildup was hard to remove. I used more initially thinking my hair was just dry. It took a lot to get the buildup out of my hair and make my hair soft again. I'd skip this product.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
This arrived a day earlier than it said. It is everything it said it would be. I recommend it and honestly repurchase it every few months because I love it so much. It does wonders for my curly hair.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
This is a good detangling product, but it was way too oily even for my dry hair.  It just flattened it down and made it look like I hadn't washed my hair in a month.  I think it would work well on folks who need the extra moisture, which is what I thought I needed.  Oh well, I still like the Supercream and the Ultra Defining Gel.  Also, the mirror curl product is nice, just don't use too much if you have finer hair.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I have used this product for 3 years and LOVE it, but this particular shipment caused me to break out in a rash and itch all over my head and neck.  The bottle also had a pin point leak in it which spread over my counter top.  I really believe the bottle was tampered with and something was put into it to cause this reaction.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I'm a repeat customer.  I always buy this product here because the price is right and it works miracles on my curls.  The fragrance is beautiful and it extends time in between washing my hair.  No more frizzies.  It goes fast because everyone in my family has 3b or c curls and  loves Deva Curl.  I'd be broke if I paid regular retail prices
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
The best. Smells lovely, and gives your hair just a bit of.... squenchiness. That's a word, right? Well, I use it to revive my curls just a bit in the morning. I water it down some so I can get it a little damper, and it seems to be just the right amount of moisture to boost the curl without adding frizz.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I love using this spray to smooth my frizzies.  The smell is absolutely amazing.  If they ever change the fragrance on this I'll be devastated.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
This product was watered down. I'm not sure if the seller put water in it or something but the consistency was completely different.  The scent was different too. And because it was watered down it didn't moisturize my hair they way it normally does. I've been using this product for year so I can tell the difference

This product really helps refresh your hair the next day so you don't have to wash your hair everyday, which is important for curly girls so they don't dry out their hair from over-washing.  It has a pleasant aroma that I often get compliments on.  It gets 4 starts instead of 5 because it's on the pricey side.

I purchased pretty much the entire Deva Curl line when I had my hair longer and was wearing it curly/wavy. This product is just OK...not particularly good nor bad. For the money, I would not purchase again. I found drugstore products that worked just as well, smelled better, and were far cheaper than this.

"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
A little of this goes a long way.  I use probably 5-6 pumps in my hands then run it thru my hair after it has been washed and air dried.  It helps to remove the crunchiness left behind from the gel but still helps the curls to stay chunky.  It has kind of a waxy build up to it if you use too much.  It smells like sweet tarts, which I like too!
"

I was a Ouidad girl but have switched back to Deva and now I don't know why I ever left Deva. This works great used alone to refresh curls or combined with an-gel when your curls are wet. Great smell and nice feel. Does right by my curls.

Best product for curly Hair!! I order every week!!!
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
It's a creme based spray.  The Deva videos say to use it after using the styling product, either ArcAngel gel or the One Condition conditioner.  So I thought it was a setting spray, somewhat like a hairspray..???  But no, it neither sets the style nor does anything else really.  Curly haired people, have you ever tried using a ""no-frizz"" serum and then gel?  You end up with a sticky frizzy mess, kinda like with this product.  It does work as a great smoothing spray for my daughter who has straight hair, but it ultimately fails at it's intended purpose.  It claims to be a ""moisture lock"" but since using the Deva line, my hair is dryer than ever.  I'm not sure there is any poertion of the line that I would re-order.  Perhaps maybe the NoPoo....no guarantees.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
This is my favorite product from the DevaCurl line!!  It really helps the curl, and refreshes the next day as well.
"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I'll give the product two stars simply 'cos it seems to work for other reviewers and it smells good. I really want to like Deva Curl products but they're not working out for me. I am a guy who's trying to wear his hair long but battling constant dryness and frizz. Today I used a little Mist-er Right and Set it Free and had disastrous results (even frizzier and drier than usual). I'm following the instructions and am not sure what I'm doing wrong. I can't recommend this product for my hair type (""s-wavy"" to ""wavy"" according to Deva Curl). There's gotta be something better out there. I'll keep looking and write a positive review whenever I find it!

Love all of Deva Curl products but I can't live without this. First thing I put on my hair after I wash and condition it. I don't have naturally curly hair, I have long stick straight hair naturally. But I've been getting super curly perms in the past two years for body and to break the boredom and even though I get my hair highlighted blonde these products have kept it pretty healthy!
"

"
DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I used this product once & it does not work. Made my hair look & feel terribly dry. Smells horrible too & really over priced for such a horrible product. I had to wash my hair almost immediately after my hair dried & the product set in. My hair was a ball of frizz. I will NEVER again betray Shea Mousture products (they are truly the best in my hair). I decided to try this stuff as I was traveling to Florida & I read this was suppose to be good for high humidity & it is the worse product I've ever tried! Never again! Save your money! This stuff is so expensive & does not work on high porosity 3B/3C curly hair like mine.

DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I have a love-hate relationship with this product, although I continue to buy it and use it. I use several of the Deva Curl products, including No Poo and One Condition. I have had a hard time finding a styling product that really works with my hair. I'm pretty picky and don't like gel or mousse, but I do love their new curl creme.Back to Set It Free. The reason I love it: my curls always look amazing, and it works great to reactivate second day curls, plus it smells great.The reason I hate it: if you use too much, your curls end up sticky/tacky and stiff. I have a serious hair obsession and often play with my hair, which is probably the reason I don't always love this product. I want my hair to be super soft and plyable but look amazing, and it seems a hard goal to achieve. With Set It Free and the new Deva curl cream, my hair comes pretty close to perfect.

Those of us who grew up with images of Boy George, Madonna and Michael Jackson on MTV 24/7 will understand what I mean. If you too were traumatized by staining, bad smelling and flammable goo they called hair gel in this era, but still have a mop of curls to tame, your worries are over. Being lead like wooly headed sheep to pledge loyalty to any single product line is not for me. Other shampoos and conditioners on the market will do the trick, but Deva Curl Moisture Lock will polish your look like you invested in all the expensive stuff. It will not cause build-up. It will not leave a grease spot on your pillow. Most of all it will give you the one thing most of us curly headed folks never really get a chance to enjoy - consistency!  Amazon's Auto-Drop feature will also give you a better price than any of the so-called discount beauty supply shops out there.

I've tried most of the products in the Deva line, and while I use and like the LowPoo and One Condition in the DEVACare line, and I like to refresh with Mist-er Right, and I use B-leave In to refresh with conditioner on 2nd and 3d days, and I like Arc Angell, THIS STUFF DID NOTHING as promised. Frizz was not reduced. Moisture was not locked in.Now, granted, I have dry 3b hair with high porosity. Maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair. But for me, nada. Zip.It does smell nice, though. That earns it at least one star. I have one bottle that I'll finish up--I use it when I use Mist-er right to add a layer of nice scent, citrus over lavender. Careful not to spritz too much, or your hair gets a dull, sort of waxy feel.But, really,can't recommend it.Ingredients:IngredientsAqueous Extracts of: Achilea Millefolium, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Cymbopogon Schoenanthus, Humulus Lupulus (Hops), Melissa Offcinalis (Balm Mint), Rosmarinus Offcinalis (Rosemary), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkylmethacrylate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, PVP, Beeswax, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Lipids, Sodium Hydroxide, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance.

DevaCurl Set it Free Finishing Hair spray; 6 Ounce,"
I have fine, wavy, very unruly hair, prone to frizz.  For years, I used gobs of product and lots of hairspray to set the whole mess.  I found out through trial and error the sulfate and alcohol in the products were my worst enemy.  I now use all sufate-free products and my hair feels like it never did before.  I use Set-it-free as a finishing spray on dry hair and it forms a barrier against moisture, leaving a soft sheen behind.  You have to practice to get the right amount for your hair, so start small and work up.  WONDERFUL STUFF, I need to stock up in case they discontinue it!! I have been a licensed hairstylist for 30 years, so I have tried many of the best professional products.  Deva Curl has some of the best stuff on the market for frizz control.

98% of my hair regimen is DevaCurl products, so I was excited to try this out. I have no issue with their price point because I'm a firm believer in getting what you pay for. That's my problem with this leave in, it's pricey but does not perform. It's not bad by any stretch, but it's just ok. I'll finish the bottle but can't see buying again

This made my hair very sticky then eventually frizzy. I’ve used Deva products for over a decade, and this absolutely fell short for me. I know how and when to use them and even while applying with saturated wet hair in the shower, I could feel my hair turning to straw with it on. Used it twice. Can’t risk it again. Keep your money and use One Condition decadence as your leave in.

Recently starting my curly girl method journey, i began purchasing DevCurl products. I ordered shampoo, conditioner and styling cream from Amazon and i loved them all. i could tell instantly that they were gentle and nourishing and of high quality. Unfortunately when i purchased this product it was absolutely awful - as soon as the product touched my hair in the shower, my hair went ridiculously dry and brittle. i couldn't run my fingers through it AT ALL, bearing in mind i was using this product after i had used a conditioner, so my hair was lovely and soft and then all of a sudden when using this product, it became as dry as wood.now i still haven't had a chance to purchase this item legitimately from the devacurl website, but it's obvious from experience with their other amazing products, that this is not the original. i really believe that this is fake. i gave it a try for a few weeks but it only got worse and i actually ended up selling the remainder for £1 at a carboot sale!I would really encourage everyone to not risk buying this product from Amazon.

I LOVE this leave in conditioner! My hair is Extremely thick so it is very important that I have a really hydrated leave-in to put into my hair before anything else. This does the trick! I use it after the No Poo Decadence Cleanser and No Poo Decadence Conditioner. Honestly I have tried so many different leave in products over the years but now that I have the decadence DecaCurl line I will jever use any thing else on my hair! The smell is amazing also!!

I’m a devacurl addict and I really think this product is my favorite.  I really wanted them to make a leave in conditioner, and it has thus far performed well for me.  It leaves my curls soft and moisturized and limits the common, ominous frizzing.  I apply it to wet hair and work it through then let it sit in my hair in a microfiber towel, then air dry.

Oh gosh! I was so scared to try this because I’ve had zero luck with leave in conditioners.

I have type 2b/2c curls and I use this in conjunction with other Deva Curl products.  It’s not enough moisture most of the time so I use a squirt or two of One Condition along with it.  I’m only six weeks into using the curly girl method, so I’m thinking that down the road, when I don’t need as much moisture, this will be enough.  However, I think “Leave-In” conditioners are just a marketing ploy and regular conditioners can be used for the same purpose.  I do like the texture and slip of this stuff, though, so I’ll probably keep it around.  (I’m quite contradictory, aren’t I?  Sorry!).  Please check the seller reviews before you buy because I know there are a lot of counterfeit products out there.

I love DevaCurl products, I am woman of color with natural hair (No chemicals added) and it works wonders for my curls. But, I've seen it work wonders on all curls.

I have had natural curls (3b) for a few years and never have had issues with the many products I’ve tried. I don’t know if this product is fake or if it’s true that devacurl changed owners and is adding different ingredients. I’ve heard a lot of horror balding stories lately about the brand but decided to try it out. This product caused a lot of irritation and the back of my neck is red and peeling. I’m not allergic to anything so whatever is in this product must be strong. It caused a lot of itching which has never been a problem for me before. I’ve stopped using it and it’s gotten better. This is a picture of what’s left. Definitely wouldn’t recommend.

"DevaCurl Leave-In Moisturizing Decadence, 8oz","
I received a large sample of this in my Sephora Play box and immediately fell in love with it. I have thick wavy, shoulder-length hair and like to wear it straight with a blow-out or curly with a blow-crunch. One day while feeling lazy, I just put it on my hair and let it air dry. The result was beautiful ringlet curls that had absolutely no frizz (better than if I had spent 40 minutes crunching it). The product smells so good and feels very light-weight. I just ordered a regular bottle. Only wish it fell under Amazon Prime's 2-day delivery. It's going to take more than a week to come.
"
"DevaCurl Leave-In Moisturizing Decadence, 8oz","
I was hoping this would be a great leave in conditioner but it's just not for my hair type. It doesn't feel soft or hydrated at all after using it. I like the One Condition  Decadence but it's not a leave in.
"
"DevaCurl Leave-In Moisturizing Decadence, 8oz","
So disappointed. I’m a big fan of the decadence line. This product does not live up to the standards of the others. I used almost half the bottle and it does come up to the little bit of conditioner that I’ve been using as a leave in.
"
"DevaCurl Leave-In Moisturizing Decadence, 8oz","
Although this is ridiculously pricey, it is an amazingly effective leave-in moisturizer.  It does not make my extremely curly dry hair the slightest bit gummy, tacky, or weighed down, and it lasts for at least a couple days, so you don't need to be terribly concerned about dryness between washings.  I use a fairly large amount in my palm before gel.  If it's not a ""style day"" for me, I follow up with oil.  Otherwise, after the Leave-In Decadence, I use defining gel and use the MirroCurls after my hair is dry.  I love this product.
"
"DevaCurl Leave-In Moisturizing Decadence, 8oz","
As a long time Amazon-Deva customer, I can say that from time to time you get a dud product. It’s the price you pay for not paying salon prices. So either this product was super expired, or they replaced the contents of the bottle with lice shampoo—it has the same scent and consistency. And if you’re a true curly girl like me, that imagery alone should have you looking towards the Heaven in Hair (which I use as a leave in conditioner and HIGHLY recommend) or sucking it up and purchasing this at Ulta if you really want to give it a try.
"
"DevaCurl Leave-In Moisturizing Decadence, 8oz","
I love deva curl products, but I'm not sure I will buy this one again. The pump came broken, and the product doesn't seem to be that amazing to justify the price. The broken pump is especially a pain in the ass because I work in Afghanistan and use a community bathroom, so it's more of an inconvenience than if I was at home. I'd go with the curl cream if you're looking for a leave in.
"
"DevaCurl Leave-In Moisturizing Decadence, 8oz","
Been using this for months and found it cheaper here than at ulta. If you have curly hair dont hesitate buy it! It smells like floral mixed with a creamy, sweet milk! I know that sounds odd but it is such a heavenly scent thats not overpowering. The consistency is like a  gel cream which I love. My hair can get weighed down with typical black hair care products and this is the perfect level of moisture an curl definition. I am jamaican but my curls are closer to more of a domicican curl pattern so this product is very versatile. My only con is I wish the bottle was a smidgen bigger.
"
"DevaCurl Leave-In Moisturizing Decadence, 8oz","
This product is expensive for my needs, even though I love DevaCurl products. I find that the DevaCurl decadence conditioner works better for my curly dry hair. It is nice for a change as it is so easy to use, but for e everyday use, I will stay with the regular conditioner.

I get far better results from using the One Condition Decadence as a leave-in. This doesn't do anything for me. It disappears into my hair (3A-B, very fine and dense, low porosity). Maybe it has something to offer those with a thin head of hair and loose curls/waves, but even then I can't imagine that it would possibly be worth the price.

I didn't like this product. It's not moisturizing. It left my hair hard to brush and tangled. It felt like gel. I wouldn't buy.

It’s  totally the opposite of what I was looking for.  My daughter has very dry curly hair and this only gave her hair a dry crispy look. This feels like gel and we all know that curly hair doesn’t want anything to do with gel. I have tried the styling cream and its much better.Please correct me if I’m maybe using it in the wrong way. Its a leave in !! That’s it.

The first two times I used this product on my toddler's natural, thin hair, dry curls, I didn't really notice a difference. However, after about the 4th time, you can really see a huge difference.  Her hair is now super silky and it forms ringlets naturally.  I have washed her hair about every 3-4 days.  Today I was able to run a brush through it in about 5 strokes, where I normally spend about 45 mins detangling it.  The brush makes a difference too, though.  The product smell is a bit odd, like soap concentrate, but it doesn't leave a strong smell behind after rinsing. I will put up with the smell for the results. I haven't used the towel yet.

You are better off buying the shampoo/conditioner on the DevaCurl website. They have sales pretty often and then after you spend a certain amount, you get free samples or a free Deva Curl towel. The towel that comes with this set is marketed as the original Deva Curl towel (grey, bigger than a hand towel, and very nice microfiber), however what you get is a dumbed down version for Amazon that is smaller than a hand towel (see picture) and is cheap like the microfiber cloths you can use to wash your floors. I’m disappointed in the deceiving marketing and Amazon accepting such a cheap product replacement.

So I decided to try this because my hair was all blah and not looking good when air dried. I use to wash EVRY day because I go to the gym and of course my hair gets all gross. I heard about the curly girl method and decided to give this a try. I bought the one for wavy hair! OMG let me tell you!! I just got my hair professionally cut and dyed about four days ago and washed it for the first time this morning. I was skeptical because the shampoo didn’t foam like the others I am used to. I rinsed and conditioned and followed up with the recapture whip, plopped for about ten minutes and let it air dry. The left is this morning and the right is after running almost four miles sweating with it tied up.. omg!! Love this!! Highly recommend and will be buying more of the products. I have my eye on the set it free spray.

i have been using hair iron on my curly hair for a few years now because my curls were terrible. I am determined to get my natural curls back and many have advertised this product as a miracle working product. So I decided to try it, and from my experience, it didn’t live up to my expectations. My curls still look terrible but what i love about this product is that it helped hydrate my hair, it did not feel greasy or stiff like some products i tried. The smell is nice, so i think this is nice for people who already have nice natural curly hair and not for people who want to revitalize their curls back to life. Lol

For all those who are trashing the towel, it clearly states on the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION and BOX, that it includes a MINI towel. That's why this bundle is affordable and for those who want to try the curly girl lifestyle before they spend $$ on liters of conditioner.I received exactly what was described and shown: 1 mini Deva towel, and two 8 oz bottles: 1 of low-poo original, and 1 of one condition original.Product came in one day, package unharmed and unopened. Choose your sellers wisely, do your research. Then you won't be disappointed when you receive fake garbage.

I am a product junkie. I recently went in for a baylage coloring. I wanted a subtle brown because I have thick curly hair and already experienced my hair breaking off after dying it blonde when I was younger. Anyway, the beautician left the bleach in to long and woe to me super blonde baylage. I immediately started researching what to do to dmsave the locks I spent years regrowing to such a great length that i was sure I'd have to chop off. Stopped straightening, weekly deep conditioning, and my hair not broken off at all. But, those baby curls I had growing up were gone! My hair just looked like sad wavy half twisty shapeless. I read about devacurl and gave it a go. Along with fingertwisting and just curly girl TLC I revived so much curl. And this set just leaves my hair looking touchable and soft, unlike other product that have your roots greasy or hard. I really love it.

First, the con.  The microfiber towel is the size of your average bar towel, smaller than a kitchen towel.  There is no way to wrap it around your head.Now the pro.  This product is fantastic for thirsty frizzy curly hair.  It doesn't have a strong fragrance.  It is thick and penetrating.  Perfect for my unruly hair.  It is gentle enough that it does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin (other products have caused break out and rashes).  I'm very pleased and would order again.

I tried this product for a month before writing a review to make sure I allowed time for build up to be removed from my hair and to give this enough time to work. I have not noticed any difference at all. My hair is still pretty frizzy, and my waves are not discernibly different. I do like the smell of the shampoo (low poo), which smells like calming essential oils to me, but other than that I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it, especially for how expensive it is. It is no better than much cheaper shampoos/conditioners.

I had such high hopes for this shampoo.  I read the Curly Girl book and just assumed this shampoo/conditioner would be perfect.  Unfortunately, it made my 2A/3A/3B  curls/ringlets very undefined and my hair felt very greasy and sticky.  It weighed my hair down so much that I just had waves.  I tried the Cantu shampoo/conditioner and it works so much better!  So, switching back to that one.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I've used other no lather type shampoos and generally a condition is not required since it's kind of an all in one. With this product, I cant understand why a no poo and then a conditioner.  My hair feels clean, light and bouncy, and generally hydrated. Not as good as my other stuff.  I still use my standby of leave in cream by Mark Anthony along with a moroccan oil after towel drying.  The microcloth is a bit of a joke. I see a very very nominal difference between a cotton towel and this.  A cotton towel will absorb better than this.  I like the product very much, but the smell well, it makes me think of a very lemony urinal cake.  I love lemon, but this is not quite right.  It doesn't stink, but they need to tweak the scent a little.  I will keep looking for a replacement for my old standby that has been discontinued, but meanwhile it's a keeper.

CLEANSING CONDITIONERI am new to the curly girl method but I've had friends recommend other products since I bought this. I have a lot of hair (short but thick) and it takes a lot of cleanser to get it clean. I wash my hair every 3-4 days and in a month I've used 1/4 of the bottle. The last product I used a bottle lasted the full year, and it was a smaller bottle. It might be worth it if you have thinner hair but I end up in a cycle of add product, massage into roots until it won't spread anymore, add product, etc. I'm trying to stretch the bottle out and not use more than necessary but it takes forever to get my hair clean.CONDTIONERIt does it's job but I've had better. It feels a little thin/watery and it's not great for detangling. I detangle with my fingers in the shower but otherwise don't brush my hair. My hair doesn't get too knotted between washes but devacurl does a noticably worse job than other products I've used.TOWELBefore I bought this I read so many bad reviews about the towel. I didn't care about the towel, I purchased this kit to try out the products, but I can't ignore it in my review.I'm not a fan. I have shoulder length hair and I can't wrap it in this towel. Also, I always use microfiber camping towels on my hair and they work much better. They are thin in comparison to this plush one and I think they create less frizz. I only use this towel when my others are dirty and I need to do laundry.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I used this product as directed and have to say that it does not work on my type of hair. Any product that leaves my hair hard and not so good to comb through is not suitable for me. Even when I used the conditioner, it left my hair a little hard and not easy to manage. I only had it for a couple of days, but first impressions are the key. I will not recommend this product at all. It just doesn't work for my type of hair.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
it feels and smells fantastic but my hair was super tangled when I was washing it. I think I need products that are bit more moisturizing. So I'll be returning this and ordering the Devacurl Decadence kit.

I got a perm in my hair and decided to try Deva Curl to keep the curls curly. This cleanser is so much easier to use than regular shampoo. I wet my hair apply the cleanser, run a little water over my head to spread it out and then make small circles on my head to move the cleanser through my hair on my head. Then gently let it run through the rest of my hair. My hair is clean and it doesn't get tangled. Then I use the conditioner and then do a quick rinse through leaving some on my hair. I found the curl cream keeps the curls better than another brand I tried. All together works well.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
If this review was for the conditioner alone, it would be an easy five stars. I got this as sort of a sample kit for myself because I wanted to try the products & towel to see if it made a difference. I can't say as the towel makes a huge difference & the cleanser, acting in place of shampoo, is just basically a less intense conditioner product and as expected if you wash your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo, your hair will be limp & greasy looking by day two. All that being said, I'm hooked on the conditioner. Any product that is so amazing I can just run my fingers through with it in the shower and actually completely detangle my long, curly hair has me for life. My hair feels like hair after I use it instead of making it feel like straw like with other products. So-and this just me-I have found I need to use actual shampoo for my roots if I want some volume, so I alternate; some days I'll shampoo w/ an actual salon quality shampoo such as if I'm going out or my hair is feeling extra greasy, then follow with the DevaCurl One Condition. If I'm staying in, I ""wash"" with any conditioner, then again, always follow with the DevaCurl conditioner. So I got what I want out of this little kit; I discovered what is worth sticking with and what isn't. From now on, I'll buy just the conditioner and in bulk!

Ever since having my baby 5 months ago, my scalp has been so irritated (probably due to hormones) so I was curious about the ‘no shampoo’ method of washing hair. I specifically got this product so I could test it out for a month or so (based on turn size of product) vs committing to purchasing larger bottles.The size of the bottles are great!!!!The towel size is perfect for ‘scrunch drying’; after doing that for maybe 30 seconds? you don’t need to put your hair in a turban to dry at all!I purposely also did not my ANY product in my hair post shower and let it air dry so I could see how frizz-free it would really be and, WOW! I even had lunch in Florida in the heat and wan unaffected but frizz. I am VERY excited to use this product again!!!!

I have natural curly hair, well before this stuff natural fizzy hair. Nothing has ever helped as much as this stuff. I love it and that I can use it every day is even better. My hair actually looks better if I use it every day versus every other. It does not dry out my hair. I am use to no poo shampoos so the fact that it has no lather is not a big deal for me. My hair has never been soft enough to finger comb it and now it is.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I bought this set because my hair was super dried out. My hair is mostly straight, with just the tiniest curl under the right conditions, so I didn't expect it to help with that.  But it did add a lot of moisture to my hair. Because it doesn't lather, it also forces you to really give your scalp a nice rub down, too. Overall, I really liked it and would recommend! I will say though, that even after months of using only this, I still found that my hair was a little more oily overall. I generally wash my hair every 2-3 days and with this I had to wash more like every 2 days if I really wanted fresh hair. It also didn't seem to work as well with blow drying, but with air drying (my usual), I had some nice volume!

I bought deva curl and after my first use, my hair looked atrocious— not at all what I was expecting. After doing some research, I’ve learned that devacurl products have been causing hair loss and scalp irritation for thousands of women. There’s even an on-going lawsuit against Devacurl for those exact reasons. If you go to the Think Dirty app and type in devacurl, you will see how poorly made and how bad their products are for your hair. Although I haven’t experienced this because I have only used it twice, there are plenty of videos on YouTube and groups on Facebook that have people attesting to this. All I can tell you is to do your research.

Be careful I bought this a couple of months ago and started using it and bought more products because it did initially make my hair look good. Soon after my hair became dry and it started falling out. After looking into it I found out that they have a lawsuit against them because so many other people were dealing with hair loss. I also checked the product on think dirty app and the devacurl products are very dirty and filled with toxins. Save your money and buy other products instead of ending up like me and throwing $150+ products in the trash

I love how Deva Curl products help my hair to be very curly without frizz,  so these 8oz shampoo & conditioner were good starter sizes. Very disappointed with the towel size which is much smaller than I expected. Gray towel sold on its own claims to be 20x40 in. The one in this kit is barely 15x24 in. which means I can't use it to wrap my head ... only to blot excess water away. I would not recommend this kit.

Great for my curls but my scalp did not like these products. Gave me an itchy scalp.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
The product doesnt smell that great and it made my hair feel really heavy and almost greasy. It also didnt really help with my frizz either which is unfortunate with all the reviews I read before buying. :/

"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I worship not love but worship the zero lather cleanser. It’s awesome if girl anyone with a hair type that needs those natural oils in their hair. You have to rinse it well to get any flakes out. The conditioner is ok, I’m going to stick to my holy grail, but the towel is great too. Over all it was a great purchase for me and I’m very happy with it!

"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Product has a medicinal scent, which was easily masked with a few drops of essential oil (I like calming lavender, since I shower at night). I've been using this product for a month now, and it's really improved the texture and overall health of my natural ""s-curl"" hair!
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I had high hopes that this would help get my frizzy wavy hair under control. Sadly I was only able to use it once. I am sensitive to smells/fragrances, and this is too much for me to handle.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Good starter kit for Curly Girl Method but the towel is way too small to wrap around my head. However it's useful for blotting excess water. Too bad as just 6 more inches would have made it perfect for my hair. I do like the shampoo and conditioner.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
The shampoo and conditioner really help my hair - I definitely feel the difference in the texture of my curls and the ""bounce.""  I love the towel too!!  I was skeptical when my hair stylist said to use a microfiber towel for curls, but it really does make a difference - it's much less frizzy!  My only disappointment is that it's more than I like to pay.

My hairdresser was so upset this product caused my hair to break and dry out I had to have it cut and now having scalp and hair treatments my curls are never going to be the same
"

After using this product my hair has been falling out

The conditioner smellls like a porta potty air freshener. It’s so strong and unpleasant and it stays on your hair all day.

"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
It seems to take a while before your hair adjusts to the deva system but I like them. Not a fan of the scent but makes my hair less frizzy and holds natural curl instead
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Favorite hair product. I order on a regular basis.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Exactly as expected. The shampoo alternative worked surprisingly well. I think I like Aveda products for curly hair better but I really liked the value for the money here.

i use this products for long time i buy from deva curl.com and work perfect for  mebut not this from amazon im not happy at all,i will not buy it again from amazon.

"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
My hair is loving DevaCurl!  Just started using it about a week ago.  Already, my hair is softer, fuller, and curlier.  My scalp feels comfortable and healthy, not itchy.  I also started using the DevaCurl styling products, and I love those, too.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Let me start by saying I am a product JUNKY! I cannot go into a store without perusing by the hair care section. I do my best to take very good care of my hair.That being said, I'd already tried devacurl before I bought this kit, so I was aware of how my hair reacted. The no-poo is hands down my favorite co-wash I've ever tried. I love how it makes my scalp truly feel clean after use. I'm not as attached to the one condition, or the towel that comes in the kit. As far as the conditioner, I can tell my hair is softer after using it, but I've gotten similar results with other products. The towel was my least favorite. I have quite a few microfiber towels, and this one is not only the thinnest, but snagged on my hair the most. I could feel it getting caught where my hair is a bit more coarse than the rest. I only use this to kind of ""scoop"" up my hair to bring the pattern out more as opposed to any long term use with my other towels.TLDR; if you've never used DevaCurl, give this kit a shot. If you have coarse hair, watch out for the towel, though!
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I had high expectations for this brand/products but was not impressed. Used for months with no noticeable difference or improvement to hair.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
These hair products make my hair smooth and soft without being greasy, and they smell fantastic! Whether I wear my hair curly or straight, it is much softer since I started using the DevaCurl products.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Products are so tiny and worth so much money
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
This product is horrible!!! My curl pattern has changed completely since using this product. My hair was curling from root to end, now it’s brittle and stringy. I am highly disappointed in the dishonesty of this company. We trust that a product would put effort into an acceptable formula, but Deva Curl has failed. Money is not everything. Deva Curl you are ruining people’s hair.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
This is a great start up kit, especially because of the towel that is included. It’s a decent sized towel for squishing out excess moisture in my curls, big enough to do the job, but still small enough to pack for trips. No more terry cloth frizz for me! Making the switch to these products was easy. I went cold turkey and with no regrets! It helps that they smell so wonderful!
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I brought this product for my teenage daughter. She has beautiful curly, long hair. We have tried numerous products on the market some work, okay most do not. The problem with most products for curly hair is that they are drying, and frizz curly hair. With Diva Curl her hair looks smooth, her curls more defined. Product is five stars.  We both thank you.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
My naturally curly hair was so damaged from coloring and using heat on it that it was loosing most of its natural curl.  After just a couple of weeks of using these products, (and discontinuing using a curling iron) I notice an amazing transformation in my hair. It it so curly, so soft, and so manageable. Thanks Deva Curl!
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Have not used the product yet, so I will update when I do. But, beware. The pictures show the bottles as 12 oz, but they are actually only 8 oz. I should have researched more, but accurate photos should also be used.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I started using these products about a week ago and my hair feels great.  Nice soft curls.  I like how they had a sample size so I could test the products out before committing to the larger more expensive sizes.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I have wavy 2b type hair. The conditioner works well and I've been using it for about a month now. As long as you keep a lot of it as a leave-in, it really helps to reduce frizz. The shampoo I am not super impressed with. I feel like it leaves my hair a little stiff towards the roots. The towel I love and I use it every time I shower to dry my hair.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I guess I expected more? The scent isn’t all that great... I had been using it for a couple of months, and I hadn’t really noticed a difference.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Didn’t work for me. Maybe it’s just my hair but it didn’t do anything special or different. Pretty sad I hoped this was the product to bring the curlyness to my hair but nah, didn’t work.

Lost lots of hair in the shower adnormal shedding while using this put my brush through my hair and it was like i had weave just ripping out bottom of my hair was dyed about 4 yrs ago so almost all of my hair is virgin no heat ): sad i liked the way my curls looked i am 16 years old.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I had high hopes for this as I've seen nothing but good things about it. I never felt my hair was clean, the shampoo was incredibly hard to distribute, and it left my hair feeling limp and oily.

Not for me. Left my hair feeling greasy.

The towels a bit small, you can't trap your head in it like a normal towel, but the shampoo and conditioner are amazing.  I'm converted.

Why didn’t I do this sooner. Gives curl a healthy boost. It did an amazing transformation.

I love devacurl shampoo!! My curls are more bouncy and defined than ever! My only complaint is that after a few washes I do see and feel that there is product build up in my hair which means I still use regular shampoo about once or twice a month.

I have natural curly hair and this product has dried it out. I the only item I intend on keeping from this set is the towel.

Horrible. I wanted to love the devacurl products but it does make my hair fall out more than usual in the shower. If you do a search on Youtube and Google about the pending lawsuit you will know what I'm talking about.

The bottles were bigger than I expected and it works great. My hair isnt dry and frizzy at the roots like it usually is. Plus it came really early. The only thing wrong with it was that the towel was packaged outside of the box. But other than that its perfect.

I was so excited to order this product based on seeing pictures on Instagram and YouTube reviews. Honestly I am not sure how they got that kind of results. I have 3C type curls.

The fact that the shampoo doesn't lather and my hair basically absorbed it freaked me out but after I got over that....this stuff is amazing. The smell of the shampoo is a bit weird (kind of minty?) but the conditioner smells like fresh, clean laundry. The towel that comes with it is also the best thing ever. Overall, this product does exactly what it says it will. I don't like how much of the product has to be used (it requires quite a bit per wash) but it's worth it. If you're unsure of you can ditch your traditional shampoo, this is a great kit to try to test the waters.

I started with DevaCurl for my super thick, curly hair...I was talked into trying a company that is well know, but evidently new to the curl-game.  I liked the new product for about 2 weeks.  I went back to DevaCurl after 30 days of the other product.  Don't plan on straying again from DC!

This stuff is GREAT! I'm particular. I only gave wavy hair, not truly curly. The gel makes it really curly. I feel like a woman with naturally fallen curls. Buy this, watch the .youtube videos and you'll say you've never glad curlers like this in your life either! Whopee!

Bottles are just too small.  Towel isn't that great either.  Paper towels work better to absorb excess water and leave hair frizz free.

"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Not worth it.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
The smell is awful. Smells like lice repellent shampoo and it sticks around. My hair is naturally thick wavy curly and dry. This made it impossible to comb through and gives me that heavy feeling. Left my hair less curly than normal. And it would either make it more dry or feel greasy. I use Redken Soft and it is wonderful on the dryness and curls.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
The very first time I used this kit I thought, ""yippee! I have my hair back!"" but the second time and then for weeks after, my hair just get more and more dry and frizzy. Not for my fine wavy hair, unfortunately.

I like this kit! Since giving up shampoo, my scalp has never felt better! These products leave my hair feeling nice, clean, and moisturized. It stays clean for days, too! I'm not generally a fan of products that smell like rose, but it this is lightly scented, not overpowering at all. The microfiber towel is super absorbent but I wish it was a little bigger. I can't wrap it around my head. DevaCurl has just released a larger towel and I plan on purchasing it.

Over the last 3 months I have gone on a journey to get my curls back! It's amazing what can happen if you spend a little time researching and actually caring for your natural hair! At first I tried a home remedy, Aloe. I blend up the aloe gel, set it in my hair for an hour and then washing it off. This was great for healing my hair and making it longer quicker, but I knew I was still missing something. My curls! I have this beautiful long healthy hair but my hair was just not bouncing back like I wanted. After watching some hair health care tutorials on youtube, I noticed this product come up ALOT. So I decided to try it out.Oh boy did my hair start to bounce and shine! After a month of using a whole 2 inches from my scalp has become curly like it once was. The rest of my hair is mending and curls are redefining after every wash. My hair is going through one of the best transformations it has ever gone through. I still use the aloe since it is still very good for your hair, and even skin, but this product gave me what I was missing! One rule I am trying not to break is: no heat. I have not applied heat to my hair since the beginning of my journey. I am fully appreciating my natural hair and DevuCurl is helping me do that!The product:The buildup buster is AMAZING. just a quarter goes a long way and really cleans my hair.The no-poo I feel has the same consistency as the conditioner, sometimes I don't want to use it because it feels like I am conditioning twice, but its part of the program so I have opted to use it.The conditioner is lovely and velvety and allows for me to detangle easily.The cream is enough to curl my hair. I usually use curl cream and not gel or hairspray. I prefer the natural look with some frizz, so this product if perfect for my style. I do think it works better then most curl creams I have tried.

I'm not use to taking care of curly hair, I use to just have perms done.  However, my hairstylist was able to show that I had natural waves to my hair.  She recommended DevaCurl to take care of my curls.  I liked that they had a video on determining which products are right for your hair.  I chose this one to start with and I like the results.  I get a lot of compliments from people.  I'm still getting use to no ""poo"" when shampooing my hair.  But my hair feels great after the conditioner.  I've also bought the Styling Gel that goes on wet hair and you can let it air dry.  Works every time.  Love it!  Would recommend getting their Hair Towel and following the instructions to get the curls you desire.  I love that I can shower and go some mornings when I need to. The curls usually last 2-3 days without washing.

I have frizzy kinky naturally curly hair and I tried this and the no poo shampoo is weird. I'd rather co wash with conditioner because it made my hair feel dirtier almost and not soft. I like the hair gel it makes it crunchy though I might have bought that separately but the lotion was just ok. This system was definitely not worth the price I paid I prefer herbel esence conditioner for co wash over this. I felt like it was a waste of money but the shipping and packaging was fine.

I’ve tried this product on two different occasions and was really not impressed either time.  I have fine, naturally curly hair that frizzes easily and this product does not help.I do highly recommend Curly Sexy Hair curl enhancing shampoo and conditioner for fine curly hair.

"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I absolutely love this product. It was a little odd for me at the beginning because there are no bubbles or foam. It's more of a lotion. And I was worried I would feel dirty still. But no it is great. Leaves my hair hydrated and soft. I usually have problems with a dry scalp because I have dry skin but this product helps that issue. I just don't know if I can commit to buying it. I may just buy it again and continue alternating between this product and OGX Beauty shampoos.

Hey hairstylist recommended this stuff because my hair was crazy dry after my pregnancy, and she said between hormones and silicone build up I should try this pack. Love it! Use the builder up buster a few times in the beginning and I use the no poo and conditioner daily. It’s a little pricey so I may do like 4 days on 3 days with another shampoo... we will see how it goes. A little product goes a long way.

Great introduction to DevCurl's No Poo line without a ton of financial commitment! The scent is lightly floral, not overpowering to me. It has done wonders for my curls! I love it!
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Love! This is exactly the shampoo/conditioner/set I needed! It is definitely made for curly hair and my hair has been doing so well since starting with this set. I recommend this brand to anyone struggling with frizzy, unmanageable or sad curly hair. I will stick to this brand moving forward!

I had previously used Wen but was looking for a more economically priced product.  I have somewhere between curly and wavy hair and found that with this product my hair was more frizzy then with the Wen.  I liked the idea of the towel but scrunching my hair with it also seemed to make it frizzier.  I will say my hair was very soft when I used this product.

Wow. I have literally tried everything on my daughters hair. Her hair is coarse, dry and frizzy all the time no matter what we use on it. I will post a before after photo. It is night and day difference after 1 use.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Love the product. I hate the smell of the conditioner though, it smells like pee. Other than that, I've definitely seen an improvement with my hair, the texture, definition and overall health. I've been using the product ever since I got it about a month ago.

Bought this for my daughter at the recommendation of her hair stylist.  It works great on her hair and she loves that the towel helps with frizz.  Have ordered this product multiple times now.

I like this product but maybe for winter better than sweaty summer. I just don't feel ""washed"" after sweating at my farm all day and not feeling my scalp and hair have been de- sweated. I do like the conditioner though
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I used this for the first time the day I received it in the mail. It makes my hair soft but it doesn't help with the curls or frizziness so far. My hair is naturally curly but also naturally dry and that part is what I was hoping it helped with. Maybe the benefit is more with long term use.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Not a fan of the smell, leaves a strange almost chemically smell... also, this towel is extremely small and you're better off buying one separately, this one is barely able to hold my albeit long, but pretty thin hair.The product seems to do its job but my wavy-curls fall flat after about an hour anyways 🤷🏻‍♀️

Deva curl is a healthy way to cleanse your hair, my hair is clean but depending on how much other products I use ( mud hair color) I will use other shampoos but that is rare
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
The towel is TINY, not even half of my, pretty short, hair fits into it, so that was disappointing. The smell of the shampoo and conditioner was horrible and lastly it left my hair feeling greasy and oily.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Absolutely love this!  My hair feels and looks amazing since I switched from regular shampoo and conditioner to the no poo method.  My hair is really wavy and I like to scrunch it and go, using this product has really helped my curls look healthier and be curlier.

This is the best stuff ever!!! My daughters hair is thick and naturally curly. It was a daily battle to get all the knots out of her hair. The DevaCurl products have saved a lot of tears and frustration. Her hair is now soft and easily manageable.

This shampoo is great for curly or frizzy hair. The towel is a bit small and doesn’t work very well for long hair.

Used this product for 1 year and found it to be exceptional! It will heal your hair follicles and restore your natural wave. My hair is shinier and every hair dresser remarks how healthy it looks. The only down side for me was after the one year, my hair seemed too oily with this product. Perhaps it healed my hair so much it produced it's natural oil again, but I had to return to my old product to avoid that oily look. I am now alternating. Bought this small set to share to a woman in one of my exercise classes whose hair is not strong.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Ok I tried this for my daughter that has crazy frizzy, dry, hair. I didn’t notice a difference the first time I used it but today was the third time I used it and her hair is less knotty and dried with less frizz and looks so much healthier. I am going to continue the regimine and I am going to look through more diva curl products!
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Absolutely in love with this product line. My curls have never looked better and I highly recommend giving this set a shot if you're struggling with frizzy misshapen curls. I've let other family members who have different curl types than me try it and they've had great results too.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I gave this product 2stars and not one because the shampoo did cleanece my hair but was expecting it to moisturize a lot more considering it's a cream cleansing shampoo the conditioner was watered down and did nothing but leave my hair dryer than it was before.

"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
This stuff made my hair feel even more dry than normal. Also, I couldn't stand the way it smelled.

Revolutionized our lives! No more tangles in my daughter's hair, and no more tears after bath time. Have already recommended it to many of my friends.

"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
Guess I'm a sudsiholic. Shampoo works OK. I do like the leave in conditioner though.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
This kit is a perfect starter pack. The shampoo gets your hair clean without lathering, and the conditioner works great. The towel is a little smaller than I expected - you won't be able to wrap it around your head. It's a good size for someone with shorter hair (mine is above my shoulders and the size works well for me) but if you had much longer hair, I could see the towel being a bit too small. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to fellow curly haired people!

Works well.

I enjoy this so far, the products work nicely and smells good, but the towel is not for longer hair, I recommend buying a bigger towel if your hair is past your shoulders

I have semi curly hair, fine and lots of it. To have a curly do I used to have to load it with stiff gel. It would be great for one day, and look witchy the next - it was a one event do. Deva is easy on my colored hair. The style looks soft and natural. I have a great curly do day one, and a great waves do the following couple of days.mmy hair loves Deva it is so good for my hair!

"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I really like DevaCurl no poo and conditioner. It does not lather which took me a few days to get used to but that definitely doesn't affect its cleansing power. I love the fresh, minty natural smell and the way it makes my scalp feel so clean & refreshed. Most of all it really helps my long, fine, wavy-curly hair stay soft and frizz-free. The microfiber towel that came with it helps make my waves turn into nice spirals. I just put product in and then use the towel to scrunch my hair and it helps tighten my curls. It actually makes a huge difference. I will buy DevaCurl again and  I would recommend.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I ordered the wave kit directly through the Deva Curl website. So far I have only used it once. My hair is drier and frizzier than usual. Before I ordered the kit I recently started using the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel after using Mane N' Tail shampoo (once a week) and conditioner. My hair was less dry and frizzy.  As of now I will finish off the kit especially for how much I paid for it and may just go back to using Mane N' Tail before the Deva Curl Gel. I will update later.
"
"DevaCurl How to Quit Shampoo, Cleanse & Condition Kit","
I bought the gel and the curl revizer. I have very thick hair. I have a body wave now, but this stuff is so great it curled my hair by just scrunching. I got it in a sample pack and LOVE it ever since

"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
I think there are a few misconceptions about this product. For starters, like all deva products, this really works best on pretty wet hair. Otherwise, it has a tendency to be kinda sticky. The use I have found for this is as a setting spray. I notice that if I use my usual deva styling products (one condition/ supercream / ultra gel) my hair becomes more frizzy by the end of the day. However, if you spray a LITTLE amount of this on the hair after all the styling is done, it works great at setting everything and creating a better “cast” I guess at shielding the elements from your style.If you use too much of this, it will not only become sticky, but it will weigh down on the hair and affect volume. 4-5 sprays of this is all you need : front, back, left and right. I suggest to try applying all of your styling products in the shower (or just have a spray bottle handy to keep the hair wet) and then after using a devatowel to get rid of excess water, give your hair a few sprays of this. You might find that it helps your style last longer.Edit:Recently I have been using this product to replace the regular gel from Devacurl. On days where I don’t want to use too much product, I will simply saturate my very wet hair with one condition, use a devatowel to get rid of excess moisture, and then spray this immediately afterwords (the hair should still be damp). It works similarly to the ultra defining gel but I find that it produces a more lightweight result which I quite like.

"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
Great product for building curls. A little goes a long way!  Use sparingly on wet OR dry hair or your hair will be stiff and crunchy.  Also, leaves a sticky residue on bathroom floors and cabinets after spraying.  Cleans up easily with a wet Clorox wipe or other type of cleaners.

I have coarse, heavy and thick (a LOT of it) hair, and the biggest problem I’ve ever had was the weight of it pulling out the curls.  However, using this has managed to help me boost my natural curl and keep it looking fresh all day without it being the rigid, stiff “wet” look of the late 80s and 90s.  In fact, I was trying to straighten my hair recently, and my hair stylist commented that my hair was simply “holding in moisture” which was preventing a complete straightening.  (Which isn’t a bad thing - I had smoothed hair that was still voluminous and full.). I’ve recommended this product to all my friends with similarly textured hair, or those who have daughters with similar hair.  Definitely one of the few products over the course of my lifetime that actually helps to maintain my mane.

Paid $15 for a bottle of DevaCurl Spray Gel. Was really looking forward to using the product, but the spray nozzle is broken. Tried to contact the seller, Specialty Skincare, but only got an automated reply saying they got my message and will respond, but nothing after 2 weeks... With the defective spray nozzle, I cannot spray a proper mist. So I've tried to place a small puddle in my palm to use the product, but I don't think it works the same in that manner, at least not based on the other reviews. This way, it is goopy and ways the hair down. Does not do anything to help curls at all. The cheap bottle of Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl-Boosting Mousse that costs only 1/5 the price of this gel worked so much better.

I am not sure if I’m using product correctly. I am going to try to use more next time as I have a lot of hair . It does hold a curl but my hair felt a little dry . I’m not a huge fan of hair gel for this reason but someone else raves about it and so I bought it .

I've been using this line for 20 years when it was still owned by Lorraine Massey (it's now owned by L'Oreal).  But, I love it still and it makes my curls soft, bouncy, manageable and beautiful!  I love it.  You have to play around with it and know how to use it.  I have tried others and have always come back to this line.  Highly recommend.

The way my hairdresser describe this to me, who is a devacurl stylist, is that this is the light defining gel a little bit lighter in spray form. I really enjoy the spray form because it's easier to apply. I combined it with Be-Leave-In. I have fine, naturally curly hair and this works marvelously.

I used to use only the Mixed Chicks hair care products, but this is the second product (the first was the DC cleansing serum) I’ve used from the DevaCurl product line and I think I’m enjoying the mixture of the two lines! This gel is lightweight and doesn’t weigh my hair down. It smells good but isn’t too strong! It also seems to work well with my leave-in conditioner (MC). You don’t need much of it to do the job either. For those who do the hair typing, it works great for my hair, and I have a mix of all the 3s (a,b,c).

"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
I have thin fine hair. I use their other products as well.  I spray it on the bottom ends of my hair and it waves right up without weighing it down.  And the smell is heavenly - all of their products smell fresh and clean!
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
My tight curls love this product! I add a generous amount and air dry for 30 minutes before using my Deva dryer to diffuse and shape.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
Do not buy this! After a month, I have uncontrollable itching and dry scalp. I have since found out many others have had the same problem. There is even a Facebook group just for people who have hair loss and scalp/hair damage from these products.

"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
For curls in my hair. Dries too hard & too hard to spray does'nt seem to be Deva Curl  quailty. My Deva curl shampoo & conditioner was thin as water was'nt like what I purchased @Ultra very disappointed w Deva Curl companies I purchased from on line.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
This is a great product for touching up curls, it must be used lightly. It does make your hair a little stiff, but it's great for that second day curl.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
Great for curly hair that does not respond to ""anti-frizz"" labeled items.  Price is really high though...
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
I gave this a 3 although I do like the product It doesn’t come out as spray it comes out as a stream which I was very disappointed my daughter bought one also in the same thing so it’s not just mine I will be contacting the company

Cannot go wrong with Deva Curl products. I love what Deva Curl does for my natural curly hair. I also love that I can use it on dry curls.  Also, the pricing versus my salon, is a big savings.

liking all the deva products I have tried...this is my newest...and works well...as I said...I spray into my hands and then scrunch...
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
It's really hard to tell how well this product would work if I were able to actually spray it on my hair. It's to thick and sticky for the spray nozzle so that it is perpetually clogged. I don't recommend.

Followed directions. Rinsed thoroughly. My wavy/curly hair was limp and straight-ish after use.

I have more wave than curl and this weighed my hair down and it felt greasy at day 2. I can see it being good for those with more texture to their hair.

Giving this one 3 stars. Product is legit however it is not lightweight. I have 3b curls and if you don’t wash your hair every day this product makes your hair extremely tangled even with sleeping with silk/satin pillows.

I actually dilute mine into another bottle to make it last longer or me. Works just great as my finishing spray. Not crunchy at all and manages frizz while adding curl power.

Doesn’t boots curls and leave hair crunchy

Makes my hair crunchy and frizzy, when used in combination with other Deva Curl products made my hair fall out and stripped the color.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
Deva Curl has replaced their Deva Curl Spray Gel with this Curl Maker stuff and in my opinion it's a mistake - they have changed the ingredients in this product JUST ENOUGH for my hair to know the difference, and it ain't good. Why these manufacturers are always fixing what ain't broke is beyond me - anyway my hair does NOT like this ""new and improved"" version AT ALL and I won't be buying again - very frustrating.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
I love using this spray for my next day curls to revive them! Or if I just need a curl boost!
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
I’ve been using Deva Curl for almost 10 years and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  I have fine hair and this mousse is perfect because it is light weight and doesn’t weigh my hair down at all.  I like the deva curl gel (I think it’s called light defining gel these days...) but I gave it up about 2 years ago in favor of this amazing mousse. I flip my head with soaking wet hair after my shower and scrunch out a little water with a T-shirt.  While my head is still flipped I scrunch in with a few pumps of mousse, scrunch out excess water with the T-shirt again and then scrunch in a few more pumps of mousse.  I like using an old T-shirt over the micro fiber towels or a regular towel because they do a better job of removing excess water without taking moisture or product, nor does the T-shirt  disturbing the cuticle of the hair, so curls are soft and defined with virtual NO FRIZZ.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
Be careful, this product does what it says, for the most part. It adds volume and texture. I was able to get more definition of my curls at the root, usually they are pulled straight bc my hair is so long - past my waist. I found it caused more frizz for second day hair. I really could only use it the day I used my cowash, second day hair it added too much weight and frizz, curls just look dirty. Hair feels dirty. It’s not my favorite product; I’m looking for something that gives me the hold, but doesn’t make my hair so heavy and dirty the next day.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
There is a problem with this product in that the gel comes out of the sprayer in a stream. Using the gel would be much more effective if the spray was a mist. I have wavy hair and this product doesn't do much (if anything) for my hair. I'm really not sure what it is supposed to do...create more lasting waves? Maybe? A major disappointment for me is that initially, the Devacurl gels made my hair shiny. After a month of use my hair is dry and dull. This Curl Maker gel might work better on curlier hair - or perhaps as a setting gel.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
not happy at all with the product..  made my hair to dry...
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
You should know this gel does not really “spray” out of the bottle. It’s more like a way to dispense the gel which is really too thick to spray on your hair. I spray onto my hand and apply. Not a bad thing, but if you were expecting to spray it on your hair it likely wouldn’t work for you either. Smells very nice and worked as expected.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
This is a thick gel that you have to slather on your hands and put through your hair. It works pretty well for frizziness
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
After my favorite hair product was discontinued, I searched for another product.  Although this does hold my curls well, by the end of the day it seems to make my hair feel dry and tangly.  It would be nice if you didnt ALSO have to use a leave in conditioner.
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
Deva Curl products are a best friends to men and women Blessed with curly hair.  The Deva Curl lone is a little expensive, however, i can use half the amount of product from other brands and get better results.  I get so many comments on how pretty my fingers are and how yummy my hair smells.  Its well worth the money.

I love this product!  I use it all the time.  I have curly hair and this product enhances the curls and they are so soft!
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
It works beautifully. After washing my hair or on second day, I  re-dampen, put some in my hands  run it through my hair, and then scrunch. After it’s dry I run my hands thru again to blend the curls and I’m done.

"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","

Sticky and wirey curls, lost volume right away after applying. Not for me
"
"DevaCurl The Curl Maker, Spray Gel, 8oz","
I should know better. Deva Curl products do not work on my hair. I have a nice Bumble and Bumble routine that works great, but I get my haircut a Deva salon. My hair looks amazing when they do it. It looks like a flat, stringy mess when I do it. This product just made my curls crunchy. When I ran my fingers lightly through them to break them up, all the curls and wave fell out of my hair and it was just frizzy. Stick with what works.

The DevaCurl Conditioner in this kit is awesome! However, the No Poo and styling cream are so-so. The No Poo is expensive for what it is and the styling cream isn't my jam. It's too heavy and weighs down my curls, it would be good to use as a touch up product for a night out but not everyday.

I have used this product for years and it works so well for my hair. It doesn’t leave a residue and won’t weight down your hair. Fresh clean scent and my curls are on point.

Great  product!  Atrocious packaging!! With what you charge for these products  I would at least expect to see bubble wrap and tighter bottle tops.

I have curly hair. This shampoo and conditioner are great for my hair. I use the Deva gel as well as the styling product here. My hair is very light not sticky. I only wash my hair every other day. My hair is soft and curly.

It works well but I do not like the smell at all. Didn’t realize it was different from the previous one I ordered or I would not have gotten such a large size.

I have fine thin slightly curly gray hair.  This product gives my hair back its curl, takes away friz and I like the scent. I have purchased this combo three times and it is so much cheaper on amazon than retail.

The moment BOTH my husband and I used this product we experienced major hair fall out when using this product. And it wasn’t one in a while, it was every single time we used it. Once we stopped using this product the fall out of hair stopped almost immediately.

I can't believe how one product saved my hair!!! That cream is a miracle! I only need one product now and I used to be a product junkie bc nothing worked for my curly dry, low porosity hair. I don't even think I need leave in. Woke up this morning thinking I had to do my hair but my hair is a nice beautiful curly afro today. So I won't even touch it. And I'm in day 6 since I washed it and wet it. It's a miracle for my curly hair!!

"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
It like putting Crisco or Lard on hair! It's super thick but worse, no slip! Very Greasy though! It leaves white pecks when wet that has a way of disappearing as it dries.....only to become White Flakes so that it looks like your hair is snowing everywhere! Yes, I worked it in and work it through while applying. What elongation?! I mainly got it for hydration, but did not receive elongation! I used it twice with a few weeks in between and same results.I did not like how it applied when wet.I did not like how it dried.If you think you like it after the first use, wait 24 hours and shake your hair...just a little. And don't you Dare put on a dark top or dress.😲I barely made an dent in the thick Goo, and wish I could return this, but had it for a couple of months already.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
If I could give this a 0 I would.  It did the exact opposite of elongating my hair.  It actually made it shrink up shorter.  I gave this product 2 tries and applied it as directed but each time my hair shrunk up so short I had to rinse the product out and use my old stuff.  The worst part is I reached out  to the seller to inquire about the product and why this happened.  If a return was possible and they didn't even respond.  Horrrible customer service.  Which in my mind is worst than a bad product.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
I just got this product in the mail and applied it when my hair was wet. It’s super thick so I thought it would moisturize my hair. The minute I applied it to my hair it felt super rough in my hair and my hair got all tangled immediately. I’m wondering now if this is fake product because I’ve heard so many great reviews about this product. It made my hair just feel super dry and not moisturized at all. I will be returning this product.
"

"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
Saw a lot of positive reviews so did not believe the negative ones. However a negative one that I remember reading was exactly right.

Returing it.

As a woman with 4c hair, this is ABSOLUTELY everything that I need. It is not too heavy, it smells good, it doesn't leave residue, and it helps reduce shrinkage when styling. As far as using it for styling,  this has helped my hair stay conditioned, it doesn't cause flakes when it dries, and it holds very well. I have no complaints and will continue to purchase this product. (The pictures provided are the end result of me using it to style my hair. Very happy!)

My favorite curly leave in. A little goes a long way when it comes to DevaCurl products. I have 3B hair and the Super Stretch really elongates my curls, give them shine, moisture, and definition. It’s also cheaper on Amazon than on the DevaCurl website and at Sephora.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
I like this product I have long curly hair and have ALL THE SHRINKAGE. I recommend using a leave in conditioner before adding this product on top, as far as detangling there isn't a ton of slip that's why I normally use a leave in conditioner first. The smell is great but be careful how much of this product you put in because you will get some flaking especially if you have dark hair. Hold lasts all day and isn't super crunchy which is great!Pics to follow!
"

"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"

This stuff has the consistency of Crisco and hard to apply. It made some difference in my curl length but made it dry. Reviewing the ingredients I noticed it contains lye which is used in relaxers. I've been trying to figure out why I have all these broken straight pieces of hair despite not applying heat to my hair. After hearing about all the Deva curl allegations I decided to pay closer attention to the ingredients
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
I have 4C hair.  I used it for a wash n go and when my hair dried, it was the same shrinkage I normally get when letting my hair air dry.  No elongation there.  Tried it with a flat twist and had the same results, no extra stretch but nice hold for two days.  Its a creamy styler but not worth replacing other stylers that work on your hair.

DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
I have been using this product since it was launched. I love it. It softens my hair and defines my curls.  I have fine  4B hair. As far as the elongation that people have a problem with, If you have tight curls, you can't expect miracles. It makes them longer then if you define them without any product. It will not make your tight curls look like loose curls. I use this product because my scalp gets irritated from gels if I use them too often. This product gives my scalp a break. It also does not have parabens and sulfates like other curl defining creams do.  This product is a soft hold product. It will not make a gel cast. So if you need a gel cast for your curls to last, then I wouldn't get this product.  However, if you refresh your hair with a bit of water in the morning, then this product will reactivate the curl with no problem.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
This product turned my shiny, 3C curls into a fluffy frizzy MESS. I thought it would just relax the curls a little. Didn't seem to elongate at all, just added tons of frizz and stickiness. Normally I can run my fingers through it but this makes it feel like it has glue in it. I have tried different devacurl products over the years but none have ever won my heart. This one's probably the worst.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
For my 4a/3c curls, this product made me fall in love with my curls all over again!  I’m going to repurchase and try on my two daughters hair as well.  I used a leave in underneath, the Auntie Jackie’s half & half.  My curls aren’t stretched but they are super moisturized and just the right amount of hold to eliminate frizz- but not too much that it leaves a crunchy cast.  Day 2 hair is even better!  No flakes either!  I washed my hair beforehand with a gentle moisturizing shampoo and conditioned with a conditioning balm to prep.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
My hair has never looked better after I used only this one product! My curl pattern was not only super defined but this also added a lot of shine and hold to my hair (something I NEED). The only thing though was that it left my hair too greasy and therefore not touchable, but I will see what happens if I use a little less next time.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
My favorite hair product!
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
So I'm between 3C/4A, very curly, thirsty hair which gets about 70% shrinkage. I tried this after all of the great reviews here and on YouTube and I was instantly disappointed. There's no slip with this product in my hair, which makes it feel even almost brittle. Mind you, I LOVE Devacurl products! That's all I use, so needless to say, I had high hopes for this one. I returnedPros: Smells good, does not make hair crunchy, per seCons: Did not stretch curl and did not moisturize
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
This product left my 4c, high porosity, texturized, natural hair moisturized, shiny and super defined. I applied it on soaking wet hair, which really makes a difference. I didn’t need or use a leave-in conditioner. It’s a one and done product! 😍
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
I’ve purchased this product a few times and will continue to do so. It works well on my 3b/3c hair. A word of caution, just be careful about mixing your products. I noticed that some people mentioned white lumps and drying with white flakes appearing on their hair. This definitely happens if the product does not react well to other products (including shampoos and conditioners) used on your hair. This always happens to me when I use shampoos with Shea butter and then apply my leave in products afterwards. It’s happened with this product too. Just test out sample areas and try not to mix your brands. I LOVE the DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator creme. It smells great and works as advertised! [But, my curly hair friends, you do still need to seal with oil moisturizer and set your hair, as normal. ;-) ]
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"

"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
It’s a really good product, you will get longer and very well defined curls,  with a nice well moistured look,  however it’s a little greasy for my hair.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
I love this stuff. I don't know that it elongated my curls but mine are kind of loose anyway. So, I don't get alot of shrinkage. The product went on easily. You are only supposed to use a small amount. So the people complaining about residue might be using too much. The same may be true for people claiming it is greasy. I did not find it greasy at all. In fact, my hair is drier than it is usually. That is the one negative thing I have to say. It is not very moisturizing on it's own. I used a leave in and it didn't help much. If you are 3/4 natural you might want to use a moisturizing cream before your gel. I used the elongating cream and the ultra defining gel and my results were pretty good.
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
Cost too much. Didn’t work for my 4c natural hair
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"

Perfection
"
DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
I thought I'd try this because I have had pretty great results with most of the Deva products.  I currently have 6 months grown out, deva cut, shoulder length 3B/C fair hair.  Because I've had natural hair since 2008, I have long ago learned to be light to moderate on application of any styling product.  I tried the super stretch on top of some super cream and was intrigued and I later tried it alone.  My application was on wet/damp hair in this order: applied a bit of Lush R&B, this Deva Frizz-free Volumizing Foam and then the super stretch.  I use Deva Build-up Buster for shampoo followed by Heaven in Hair.  I ended up with lovely moisturized curls that are hanging longer.  There is no magic pill when it comes to stretching products.....nothing will take a very curly or coily  hair and turn it into magically long, long, long hanging hair.  But, this does a nice job and giving some elongation.  I will continue to use this.  I really like that the cream is in a jar instead of that stupid pumps that Deva is currently using on the coconut  supercream and the cream styler .  I never feel like I get to the last drop with these.

DevaCurl Super Stretch Coconut Curl Elongator; 8 oz,"
I needed something to weigh down my 3B/C coarse hair and this does the trick without any of the stiffness of gel. It also gives my hair a nice shine, and leaves my hair touchably soft.

"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
If I am going to wear my long hair curly, I HAVE to use this.  I once had a brilliant stylist tell me the best way to use it. Use Frizz-Free in the shower.  When your conditioner is still in, comb through your hair.  Rinse out the conditioner, then bend your head so the hair falls in front of you, and while wet, pump the Frizz-Free into your hands, and scrunch into your hair, starting at the ends.  Then gently wrap hair in a towel for 5 minutes.  Unwrap hair, and put into place with fingers.  Then use the DevaCurl Supercream Coconut Curl Styler -- it's the perfect partner to Frizz-Free.  Just a few pumps throughout hair.  Then let dry naturally.  Another trick is to NOT touch it until it is completely dry; this helps make it frizz resistant.  When totally dry, bend head forward, and gently fluff hair until it's as full as you want.  It leaves my hair shiny, curly, and mostly frizz free.  The best combo ever!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I received a knockoff that was slightly smaller than the original bottle, with different packaging and formula. The original DevaCurl foam has a sweet smell and the product I received smelled overwhelmingly like alcohol. Be careful!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine hair that is easily weighed down.  After shampooing and conditioning (DevaCurl No-Poo and OneCondition), I scrunch this lightweight foam through my hair and dry most of the way with a diffuser.  Then, I put clips in to lift the roots while air-drying, for 15-20 minutes.  Works great!  On day 2, my hair ""springs back"" by misting it with water and letting it air dry.  Using heat to dry on day 1 with this product is essential for my hair.  Love how it is cruelty-free, has a light scent, and lasts a long time.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine, 3A hair, and I've always had a hard time finding product that has good hold but doesn't weigh my hair down or make it stick to my head. The last time I got my hair cut, my stylist recommend I try mousse instead of gel. I've been using Deva products for four or five years, and decided to try this one.Overall, it works really well. I get good definition without all the crunchiness, flakiness, and weighed-down-iness that comes from using gel. My hair also looks good 2-3 days later, which was not the case when I was mainly relying on gel.My only complaint is that the plunger apparatus isn't very sturdy. I'm not sure if it was defective, I was pumping it too aggressively (phrasing!), or the tiny, furry terrorist who lives with me knocked it off the counter too many times, but it stopped working correctly about halfway through the bottle. The product stopped foaming out the way it's supposed to; a lot of the liquid leaked out of the bottom of the plunger. and was unusable.  Unfortunate, considering how expensive this stuff is.I like the product so much that I am buying it again, and hoping that the plunger issue was a one-off.

I buy this direct from DevaCurl and it smells NOTHING like what I received when I ordered from this group. It looks like they took a real DevaCurl bottle which was empty and filled it with who knows what (smells like ammonia cleaner), then sold it for cheap. I know better now and will only buy directly from the manufacturer from now on. I used it once thinking maybe they changed the formula and it smelled different. WRONG!! My hair looked horrible after using this, nothing like it does when I use REAL DevaCurl products. That's also how I knew something was fishy. I went to Ulta and bought a brand new bottle, opened it and it smelled just like it should. I have no idea what I put on my hair from what I bought on Amazon, but thankfully no long-term damage was done.

Maybe the DevaCurl line was too hyped up for me, but I finally caved and bought this $20 mousse. It did not live up to my expectations. I was expecting some lift, but all it does is crunch and there is no extra lift whatsoever. I much prefer the Miss Jessies line for my hair. Good luck, ladies!

I really like this foam performance wise. It's forgiving - I don't have to worry about using a precise amount or fear having too stiff or too frizzy hair. It makes my loose curls look great. There are some issues though. I do feel like I get an unusual amount of buildup when I use this. Also, the pump ends up dying on me if I don't use it for a few weeks. I'm trying something else for a while but would go back if this new stuff doesn't work out.

I love this product but the one I received is a knock off.  Buyer beware!!!  Normally when I use this product it gives me curl definition but the bottle I received from amazon did nothing for my hair.  It’s as if I used nothing at all.  I will not buy from amazing again.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I love this product and it is cheaper here than it is at Ulta. I apply to my roots while my hair is wet and air dry because I prefer a more natural look. It is a very light, foamy formula and doesn’t make my hair sticky or leave any residue. I actually used one bottle of the product and didn’t repurchase for about a month simply to try and save some money. I really underestimated how much volume it was giving my hair and ending up ordering another bottle. I pair it with the weightless waves cream

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
If I am going to wear my long hair curly, I HAVE to use this.  I once had a brilliant stylist tell me the best way to use it. Use Frizz-Free in the shower.  When your conditioner is still in, comb through your hair.  Rinse out the conditioner, then bend your head so the hair falls in front of you, and while wet, pump the Frizz-Free into your hands, and scrunch into your hair, starting at the ends.  Then gently wrap hair in a towel for 5 minutes.  Unwrap hair, and put into place with fingers.  Then use the DevaCurl Supercream Coconut Curl Styler -- it's the perfect partner to Frizz-Free.  Just a few pumps throughout hair.  Then let dry naturally.  Another trick is to NOT touch it until it is completely dry; this helps make it frizz resistant.  When totally dry, bend head forward, and gently fluff hair until it's as full as you want.  It leaves my hair shiny, curly, and mostly frizz free.  The best combo ever!

I received a knockoff that was slightly smaller than the original bottle, with different packaging and formula. The original DevaCurl foam has a sweet smell and the product I received smelled overwhelmingly like alcohol. Be careful!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine hair that is easily weighed down.  After shampooing and conditioning (DevaCurl No-Poo and OneCondition), I scrunch this lightweight foam through my hair and dry most of the way with a diffuser.  Then, I put clips in to lift the roots while air-drying, for 15-20 minutes.  Works great!  On day 2, my hair ""springs back"" by misting it with water and letting it air dry.  Using heat to dry on day 1 with this product is essential for my hair.  Love how it is cruelty-free, has a light scent, and lasts a long time.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This stuff is great! Really helps to add volume to the crown (top) area of my hair. I have medium length curls, and a lot of different curl patterns, so certain ares tend to be weighed down and/or not as curly. Because of this foam my curls look great all day! Important fact: Mix with Ultra-Defining Gel! I do a pump of the gel mixed with 2 pumps of the foam, applying both to sopping wet hair right out of the shower, scrunch, and DO NOT TOUCH until dry. It will feel crunchy, but all you have to do is flip your hair over, scrunch to break the casting of the gel, and viola! Perfect, shiny, healthy curls all day long!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"

"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
One of my favorite curly hair products!  This foam saturates the hair and helps bring out more of my curl pattern.  Plus it provides a light, flexible hold.  I stopped using it for a couple of years because of the price, but my hair looks so much better with it. So happy I found it on Amazon Prime!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I like this much better than the gel. I think it comes out less scrunchy and my hair is more work-able. I just started using it with a microfiber towel vs cotton and it was a game changer.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have 3b curly hair, and this is the only product I've found that will keep the frizz under control. I live in the South and can't avoid frizz on those humid summer days, but DevaCurl foam helps keep the frizz to the greatest minimum possible. The foam smells nice and doesn't leave your hair feeling crunchy. I've tried loads of drugstore-brand curly hair products. Deva is expensive but worth the cost for the great results.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Scent is too strong, product is somewhat effective, just can't tolerate the scent.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I am totally pleased with this product. With other styling products my short hair flattens on the top when wet. With this foam my hair gets more height in addition to more volume in general. My curls refresh nicely the next day with a water spritz. I have to be careful to apply the foam sparingly; it seems pretty concentrated. So far, no frizz after being on the water and after being outside on a drizzly day. Also, there's no lingering fragrance unlike with some of the other DevaCurl products. I'm going to give away my styling gels. This foam is the best!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I like this product.  I have naturally curly hair and this is one of the first products that actually keeps the frizz halo at bay.  I use the Deva Curl gel followed by 2 to 3 pumps of this. . .USE sparingly!  I'm still playing with my hair ""cocktail"" in the a.m.; however, this is definitely one of the products that I'll continue to use.

I wasn't too excited about this once I saw the ingredients. But I have fine, 3b curls and often a curly mousse is the only thing that works for me. If I use a gel it has to be very lightweight. Creams are too heavy for my hair, it weighs it down and makes it greasy. So I was hopeful, but then I saw the ingredients. The first time I used it my hair look good, but if you touch your hair near the scalp it was thick and almost sticky but more dry than sticky. On second day, it's almost like it gets worse, the hair gets soooo thick and sticky I swear you could start dreads with this stuff.So disappointed after spending this money, I don't have a lot of money to waste.Fortunately I also ordered a small size of the spray gel and that seems to be working better for my hair. I can't see how anyone could like this unless they do their hair in a beehive, or something really big. I need volume and frizz control, not glue in my hair. Flakey too.

I use this for my baby girls hair in the summer.  Keeps her curls fresh looking and bouncy.  I'm the father of a bi-racial child and until I found out the Deva Curl products, I had used everything under the sun but wasn't really ever satisfied.  Definitely worth it, I only wish that the price of the products were a little more reasonable.  You can easily spend over $100-$150 to get the various products to use for your hair easily,  and for a 10 year old that is a bit expensive especially I can only imagine what it will cost as she gets older and her hair gets longer...

I've used this stuff for a while now and just love it. I definitely notice a difference in hair volume when I don't use it. The bigger the hair the better I say. It does go fast, though...I have curls just past my shoulders and I use about 6-7 pumps every morning. So maybe get 2 bottles at once :)

I'm a huge fan of the devacurl products and use them regularly. But I have to give this one a pass. This is the first time using a devacurl product that my hair came out limp, greasy, and heavy with product. So disappointing! I couldn't wait to wash it out. I'll stick with the arc anGEL, which has never let me down.
"

Tames the frizzies.  Some people say it leaves the hair sticky.  Those people don't know how to use the product and probably put it on dry hair.  Probably the same kind of people who want to speak to your supervisor.

I have shoulder length s-wavy hair (yes... this puts  me at the bottom of the Deva Curl Food Chain ;) and LOVE this Foam for the extra volume and curl I need.I use this after the gel and my first micro-towel scrunch.  Then I scrunch this in my hair when it's still wet - and walk out the door.  When I get to work (I have a 45 minute commute) my hair is almost dry.  I flip my hair upside down and do a few more scrunches to 'break the crunch cap"" and quickly finger comb my hair.My hair then is soft, bouncy and full of wave and body.I use the gel because it is part of the whole process but honestly, the foam is my favorite product and what gives me the best bouncy waves and polishes my look.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have 2C/3A curls medium length thin, fine hair and I have moved to a tropical humid climate.  Frizz and dullness has always been a problem.  This foam, leaves my hair feeling soft, FRIZZ FREE, incredibly shiny even in this humidity. And it does add volume! :)  I can have day 3 hair with this product without adding anymore product to my hair. I just spritz my hair with water, to re-shape my curls and I am done.  I scrunch in the foam when my hair is dripping soaking wet and I scrunch out the excess water with a micro fiber towel and let it air dry.  I am definitely going to re-purchase this.  I have thrown out all of my heavy hold gels and mousses.  Yes, it is pricey at over $21 a bottle but I only use 5 pumps of this in my hair every time I wash it and that's all I need.  Less is more with this product.  This bottle will probably last me more than 4 months.  The inside is liquid and the product dispenses as a foam.  If you're thinking about buying this...do it.  Your curls will thank you for it.

I like this product for adding some volume. I don't know that it is a lot of volume, but some is OK. I am afraid to add some other product for volume because I do not want to ruin the Deva system by putting something else in my hair.  It doesn't ruin the feel of my hair if I put it on as directed, when my hair is still damp, but I have forgotten to put it on and tried some on my hair after it is dry. N/G. It makes your hair feel awful.It's now several months later and I'm updating this review. I bought some B'Leave-In for the same purpose as this product(control and volume). It is much better. My hair is soft and curly. I put a little extra at the crown of my head where my hair is extra dry and is softens it up. I use it after gel.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have very long curly 3A hair. I bought 3 deva products at once because I love Aveda straightening line (it works awesome for curls) but it's just too expensive for daily use. After using the deva for a month, I can say this foam is my least favorite. I found it too sticky and my hair is crunchier then I expected (from the reviews), plus it made my curls flat but I do only air dry my hair so that may be why. That being said I LOVE the creme which holds my curls without any heavy feeling or residue. I also love the coconut curl styler which I use on day 2 to rejuvenate my curls, which I really didn't think would work, but it really does.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I love this foam, it works for my hair a lot nicer than the ""AnGel"" light hold styling gel that I also have. That one works, but this one just seems to finish off better for me. Leaves my hair shiny and my curls more free.And it smells like Pez candy! Very nice.

My hairdresser has curly hair also and when I asked what she uses this is what she recommended.  I use this combined with Deva Curl Set it free every morning and my curls have never been more awesome!  And if they do get a little wind blown I just add a little more water and it immediately resets.  No more frizzy days

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls. I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren't any better than their cheaper counterparts. Don't waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products. Head to Target for the same type of shampoo, Frizz-Free stuff, gel & condition without bruising your credit card. My opinion only, but I've found better products for my curly hair at Ross', TJ Max and Marshalls. Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz. It's cheap & it works.

Not the best. In fact, my curls (type 3B) did better with Aussie brand mousse. My hair was dull and unmanageable with this mousse. It does, however, last quite a long time.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine curly hair and I've tried all the Deva Curl products.  I do  mix it up with other Deva products too. I like using the volumizing gel for the top of my head and the foam for the sides. I use all the products but my favorite is the foam it works for my fine curly hair.

I really like this product line, but it leaves residue in my hair. I am going to use it spearingly next time. But overall it works !
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This was supposed to work like a frizz reducing mousse but it doesn't even feel or look like anything is on my hair.  Not impressed with this brand.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Great product - love it. I use it with a bit of defining curl gel to make my hair fuller.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I use Devacurl NoPoo, One Condition, and Devacurl Light Defining Gel, and wanted to try this mousse for extra volume. Unfortunately, I'm really disappointed. Even with just a small amount it made my hair so stiff! I'll just stick with the gel and flip my head upside down while diffusing for extra volume.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have wavy hair, not curly. I thought this would leave my hair soft & take away some frizz. It's the exact opposite. Maybe it would work better on someone who actually has curly hair???

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Not a fan of this mousse sadly. I'm trying to stick w the product line though.

A couple things - I always read reviews before purchasing, and this had enough good reviews so I went for it. It was also cheaper than Ouidad which is who I initially checked out. I liked that this was free of sulfate etc, as opposed to Ouidad. First - it smells SO delicious. I love it. I haven't ever smelled anything like it. My hair is really thin for my Hispanic descent which saddens me, so I was hoping this would help. So far, I used it once on second day hair, after wetting it with cold water (no shampooing or conditioning). It didn't do much. This morning after my shower, where I used L'Oreal's Evercurl sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, rinsing conditioner out with head flipped over under cold water, I dried my hair with a t-shirt and applied 4 pumps of this when it was a little more than damp, scrunching as I went. I diffused and had the front parts pinned up with clips for more volume. Again today, after taking it down from the pins, I did not notice a difference in volume and that is really what I was looking for. Overall, I like the way it makes my hair smell and feel, shiny with some sturdiness, and really no crunch. I will keep trying to get the voluminous result that I want, but now I am wondering if I should have gone with Ouidad.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I am a curly girl and have followed the method for awhile now. But I haven't purchased too many Deva products to date. I had some that I liked and I stuck with them for years. I do get a Deva cut. Since I turned a certain age my hair is changing. Feels finer, and it's really gotten thinner. So the products that have worked for me in the past aren't necessarily working well for me now. Most seem to heavy. So I wanted to try a mousse to see if it would bring back some of the body my hair used to have, and maybe encourage the curl a bit as well. This product does both of those things. It does have a kind of Skittle like smell to it, but I kind of like Skittles so it doesn't bother me at all but if you are sensitive to fragrance it may. I have also learned that more is not better, in fact if you use too much your hair feels kind of gummy.  UPDATE: 11/7/17  Of course now it 's outside of return time. The product itself remains very good. But the dispenser is broken. I had a couple issues with it in the beginning but thought it was fixed. Now when I depress the pump it all leaks out from the bottom of the pump and drips down the bottle and makes a huge mess. It's unusable and it was too expensive to not feel sick about throwing it away. I would love if a rep from the seller would contact me. I haven't used much of the bottle as I only shampoo 2-3 times a week and don't need much. I would love to exchange it for one that works.But the right amount gives me nicely defined curls, and when it's dry I turn my head upside down and shake to break up the cast and my hair is soft instead of stiff afterward. As for frizz free, well that is not true at least for me. I use it on top of another product to control the frizz. It is fine for 1 day hair, but I only shampoo every 3 days. Without my other product (Curl Keeper) underneath it's a frizzy mess. However if I want killer volume for one day it's perfect alone.I guess it's kind of versatile in that way. I don't need very much. Amazon has a good price for the item, though it is still pricey for a mousse. But it is free of sulfates and silicones and not tested on animals which is important to me. It will last me a good while.

I use DevaCare conditioners and thought this product would be great. Well I thought wrong...my hair looked nappy and ended up with massive tangles instead of defined curls. Then when I went to wash my hair it was like I couldn't wash it out !  I tried it twice in case the first time was a fluke. The only thing nice about this product is that it does smell good . I have already thrown it away so I won't be tempted to give it another try !

This product was recommended to me by a hairstylist who specializes in cutting curly hair. With it, I truly do not need gel, mousse, or hair spray, and I live in humid San Antonio, TX. After conditioning in the shower, flip your hair upside down and put about 3-4 pumps of the product (my length is just past my shoulders) through your hair- (run hands along top of hair instead of putting your fingers through your hair). Once your hair is dried, you will not have that ""crunchy look"" and your hair will not have the look of too little product. I really did throw out all of the other bottles of product that I own. If you have thin, curly hair like me, I know you own at least a dozen. This stuff really works.
"

Don’t buy this product from amazon! I got this product from amazon and the first time I received it, it was great and the original product but the second time I received it, it smelt different and made my hair feel and be different. I could tell that it was not true diva curl. It actually smelt like self tanner! I tried to return it and because it’s hair product, you can’t. Just buy this from deva curl and skip buying it from amazon since you can’t return it! Such a let down.

This is by far the best product for curly hair!  I was already impressed with the other deva curl products, but this one is it.  My hair is soft, not crunchy and the curls are divine!  No frizz at all for two whole days, and I live in Houston, Texas so that is a miracle!  I think I can FINALLY toss out all my other products I have  collected over the years.

I love this volumizing foam for my curls.  I use a lot of the devachan products for my VERY curly hair.  I find that this provides nice hold and is pleasant to put in my hair.  I do think the gel is better for humid, summer days though.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This product is good at holding the hair and reducing frizz, however I have to use A LOT of it in order for that to happen. I use more than 10 pumps at a time, which is too much considering how much this product cost. I want to pare it with the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel to see what happens, even though I am not a gel person at all (my hair is thin and gels usually weigh my hair down), but I am willing to give it a try. I have 3A-3B curly hair that is a couple of inches passed my armpit.

I had high expectations with this volumizing foam, however it didn't live up to any of the expectations. The product leaves my hair crunchy and without the promised volume. I definitely wouldn't recommend this product. By the way, I my curly hair type is a mix between 3a + 3b + 3c.

"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Some people love this but it's not for my hair. I have thick hair that is very wavy and curly when wet but dries pouffy. I purchased this hoping I could air dry and have the result of natural, beachy waves. This made my hair curly and a bit crunchy a la Baby from Dirty Dancing style.

This makes my hair super knotty, feel dirty and doesn't really control frizz very well.  I love Deva Curl products, but this one isn't my fav.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I don't know why the volumizing foam appeared used and/or old. It was missing the top and even the label looked worn out. It was not enclosed in plastic like all of the other products in the box were. The bottle isn't even filled to the top; it appears that roughly 25% of it is missing. I am very unsatisfied because I recall ordering a NEW one, not a used one.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Great for hair that doesn't adjust well to product. If you 'scrunch out the crunch' it works perfectly to hold light curls.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Ok, let me just say this product has literally changed my life. It helped my fall in love with my curly hair. Say goodbye to frizz and hello to beautiful shiny curls. I have very fine hair and have tried lots and lots of products that were always too heavy.This product did not weigh my hair down... absolutely perfect!

In my opinion it's not worth it.  This product leaves my hair crunchy!  I haven't used mousse for years and I'm remembering why.  Don't let the name, ""volumizing foam"" fool you.  I bought this product because it sounded like it would tame my curls without the crunchy untouchable feel.  You may as well go to Target and buy a cheap mousse because that's what this product feels like.  I would not buy this product again and I highly doubt I will even use it again.  It may be related to my hair type but I imagine that this would be the case regardless of hair type.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Ive been using deva products for about 3.5 years now. This so far is my fave. I use One Condition daily as my CO wash and just to moisturize. I used to follow it up once i got out of the shower with the ArcAngel.. but then my stylist recommended this and I fell in love. It lasts much longer, you use less. This little bottle has lasted 3 and a half months so far and I probably have another week left in the bottle. I used 4 pumps a day and that it... i have right below the shoulder length, really curly thick hair. My hair dries quicker with than over the arc angel too.LOVE this stuff.Lightly Scrunch it in when hair is still pretty wet, and do no touch until your curls are completely dry. shake the curls and fluff it up. Perfect hair every time.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
The ingredients in the bottle have changed. The new formulation does not work as well against humidity.I have stopped using it. The ingredients as listed on this page are the old formulation.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have tried a lot of products on my curly hair, and this is one of my two favorites.Pros:- Great control.- Super light.- With a little water to refresh, easily lasts two days.- A little goes a long way.Cons:- It can get crunchy if you use too much. just don't use too much.- If I don't use the pump for a few days, it jams on me every time. this product is too expensive for it to be leaking out of the side of the bottle due to a jammed pump.

This product is a necessity for curly hair!! It's super light weight, so it doesn't weight your hair down in any way. I've been using it for about 2 years now, and it's one of my favorite devacurl products. For anyone looking to add some volume to their hair without the frizz, this is perfect for them. It leaves your hair feeling much lighter and airy, and it smells amazing. I absolutely love it.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
The best mousse I have ever used. It doesn't dry out my hair and lasts a long time. Some people complain about the stickiness and the flaking. Here are some tricks that I use: Wash your hair, squeeze water out of hair. Dispense 2-3 pumps of product (that's all you need) into hands. If you use more, you are wasting product and it will create sticky hair. Rub hands lightly together and scrunch through hair. Let hair air-dry without touching or use diffuser with hair dryer. After hair is dry, ""break"" the stiff curls by gathering your hair together and scrunching it once more. Your curls should be soft now. If you do not wash your hair every day, resist adding more foam when you style your hair the next time. This is overkill. Use a water bottle filled with water, spray your hair, scrunch and follow drying procedure, as stated above. This refreshes your curls.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I don't know too much about hair products and don't really use anything, but my stylist prompted me to try out this product (which I wasn't too unhappy to do as it's not incredibly expensive). I have pretty fine and thin-ish hair that is fairly straight with just slight waves at the ends. I'm really not big on hair product, but I've absolutely loved this foam! It's great at defining slight waves and giving thin hair a bit of lift--and it's lightweight enough to not feel as though it's sticking in your hair like many other hair products! Though it's marketed as a product for curly hair, I'd definitely say it does a fantastic job of defining thin, wavy hair, so if you do have a similar hair type, I'd encourage you to try it out! I've gotten tons of compliments on my hair ever since I started using it.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I decided to purchase this product, based on the positive reviews here, and on the naturallycurly.com website.  I wanted to get the maximum amount of curl out of my naturally curly hair, and the Ouidad products/cut, were just not achieving that.  My hair is about 3"" past my shoulders.  I applied 4 to 5 pumps of this foam on damp hair, and scrunched (in accordance with the Deva technique).  Once my hair dried, it looked like a bunch of crunchy ringlets.  I was a little concerned at that point, thinking that I may have used too much of the product.  No worries though.  Once I re-scrunched my curls, they lost that crunchy look.  I now have nice soft curls, that hold throughout the day and into the next.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This is fantastic for wavy hair. It's light enough not to weigh my hair down. I use about 3 to 4 pumps (my hair's thick & below the shoulders) after I work in some DevaCurl Wave Maker.

I quite like the product and have bought it numerous times.  I have a friend and a son who have used it.  We have all experienced bottles that quit functioning before the product runs out.  My most recent bottle quit pumping foam (just leaks the liquid product around the neck) with only 1/3 of the product used.  I will not be spending more money on this product until Deva can improve the bottle.

This product does add volume.  With super curly hair, volume isn't really the problem, but I use it for volume just at the roots of the top and crown of my head.  It seems to help prevent ""flat head.""  Very little product is needed.  It has a pleasant smell.

This works so well!!!! I only use Devacurl products these days. It's what I needed in my early teenage years. Would've saved me from a lot of bullying. This new product is great if your hair is getting thinner or finer. It really does help avoid the 'triangle' head. Thank you Devacurl! You've done  it yet again!

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This is a great product!  I use with BeLeave in after shampooing and conditioning.  Nice results.  I have swavy hair type (Natural curl when the right products are used, and slightly wavy when left alone.  I like a little more controll and some curl.  The Deva Curl products seem to deliver those results - after some trial and error on my part.  The website gives you a good recommendation on which products to get for  various  hair types; however, it still is necessary to consider your  particular  hair (thickness/thinness; fine/course; and how much encouragement it needs to  curl).

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
As with most Deva products, you'll want to watch the videos online/ read instructions prior to using, just so you get the best possible effect to start out with.  Once you get their method down, though, you can start customizing it to suit your own preferences.  I've found that the foam is sooo versatile.  I use it a few different ways, generally 5 pumps does the job (I have THICK, shoulder length waves with some curl):1.  The Standard.  Wash + condition (comb only in shower, only with conditioner in), squeeze out water, dry with an old tee, then , scrunch in 2 pumps for bottom half of hair, 2 for the top, 1 more all over for good measure.2. The Day 2 rinse.  (for post workout days where I'm not yet ready to wash fully) Rinse hair in cool water; gently massage scalp, wide tooth comb while soaking wet in shower; dry with tee; scrunch in the foam.3. The Timelapse (for when I have to check on dinner between getting out of the shower and putting in hair product.  Look, you know this happens.)  Wash or rinse; squeeze and blot with tee shirt; wrap hair in tee shirt so water doesn't drip everywhere while you check the oven, switch the laundry, set DVR, whatever; come back to bathroom and scrunch foam.  WILL WORK BEAUTIFULLY even though your hair is really a touch too dry by Deva standards.**Air dry or gentle, cool diffuse.  ALWAYS use clips at roots until nearly dry.  Scrunch and shake.I typically wash and set my hair at night, and then sleep on it! - The foam holds my curls and despite rolling around on my pillow, my hair still has volume and no frizz in the morning.Been using for about a year now - very happy.  Still use the gel too sometimes, but the foam is my preferred Deva product.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This is the best product I ever used for my natural curls. For best results, scrunch your hair dry with a microfiber cloth. I use 3 squirts for my shoulder length hair. Turn your head towards the floor, scrunch DevaCurl into your hair. If your curls are to crunchy once they are dry then do one of two things: Use less product or scrunch your curls when their dry. And remember, avoid touching your curls, they will separate and look frizzy.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
very disappointed in this, does not add volume to my hair at all but makes it feel kind of sticky like hair spray or something
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
It's good because when I apply it on my hair I obtain really pretty gets curls immediately, but this effect lasts just few hours. Unfortunately, later on the day my hair looks dry and frizzy. It might be because my hair it's very fine needs a cream instead of foam.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
FINALLY something lite in weight that controls frizz. I've been looking for this type of product for wavy hair that can't be weighed down.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Absolutely LOVE DecaCurl products!!! Since I ""converted"" I would not let anything else touch my hair!!! I have gotten many, many compliments on my bouncy luscious curls since I started using these products!Before I started using them, my hair was lifeless and my curls were... well.. not so bouncy! These leave my hair happy without weighing it down!If this review has helped you in any way, please click the YES button. Thank you.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I love this product, but I will fuss about the bottle.  This product gives me a little bit more volume, but needs to be used sparingly or my hair feels a bit weighed down.  About one ""squirt"" works really well for my medium length curly hair.  The bottle dispenser gets a little ""stuck"" sometimes and has to be rinsed, but it's not a huge issue.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
My first disappointing experience with a Deva product.  This stuff is awful. It often comes out of the container as liquid rather than foam, and when it DOES come out as foam, it leaves my hair very sticky-feeling.  On the upside, I can now serve as human flypaper! I used it for a couple of weeks, and tossed the rest which is a bummer because this isn't cheap.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine, wavy hair and this mousse is perfect. It's not too heavy, but it really helps define my curls nicely. If you put too much on, it will be sticky and heavier. I found that 3 pumps is perfect for my shoulder length hair. I love the smell too - it's a nice lemony/vanilla scent. I use Alterna's Caviar CC creme as a base and layer this mousse on top. The two together are a perfect combination.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I tried using this after a shower then defusing my hair and that was a big No No. It really dried my hair out and made it feel like hay. I tried a few weeks later to using a half pump of the product again on a day between washes to try and freshen up my curls and it worked GREAT! Didn't leave my hair dry and got rid of the flyaways.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine curly hair and usually struggle to find a product that doesn't weigh my curls down or make them too crunchy. This foam has just the right amount of hold that my hair needs. After I towel dry my hair I use a little bit of leave in conditioner then I use about 4 pumps of the foam and let it air dry. I try really hard to not touch it until its dry because it's so much better that way. Once it's dry I can fluff it up and mess with it but it doesn't destroy the curls! I would recommend to all curly girls!!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Great product for super curly and frizzy hair. I use with Deva Curl Ualtar Defining Gel. Love it. Truly amazing results. After years of using Aveda and other expensive products I've finally found alcohol free products that I really love and recommend.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I am not sure if this product contains the same ingredients as the original ones they sell at the store. But it definitely does NOT leave my hair the same.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
It makes your hair crunchy. I hate that. My fav for curls is AG Recoil with a tad of Moroccan oil. Curls come out perfect and not crunchy and you can =use it on dry hair as a touch up! I love both products! BUT GET REAL MOROCCAN OIL. Not the fake stuff! It's called MOROCCAN OIL. Band name!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I use a lot of DevaCurl products but I'm not sold on this product.  I don't see much volume from it or help with my frizz.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
So far so good! I watched videos online on how to use this product. It defintley leaves me with soft, defined curls. I do top it off with a little gel to help out with weather related frizz
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
On the Curl scale I'm about 3A/3B and my hair is almost shoulder length. I need a lot of moisture, but I also want good hold and definition. I love this product when used in conjunction with the One Condition.When my hair is sopping wet in the shower I put in about a quarter-size dollop of One Condition and scrunch that through, then I use about 4-5 pumps of this foam and scrunch that in. Then I diffuse with my blow drier on a low heat (otherwise my hair would take HOURS to dry).Things I like about this foam:-Great hold, I can wear my curls for at least two days without frizz, often times three days!-Doesn't take too long to dry, doesn't add dry time by staying wet.-No crunchy curls, they always feel soft and springy.-Seems like the bottle will last me longer than the styling cream I used to use.The smell is alright, not my personal taste, but it fades fairly quickly, so I don't notice it during the day.Lightning fast shipping too! It arrived at my house even before I got the email saying the item was shipped!UPDATE: Well, its been FIVE months, and I'm still on the same bottle! Granted, I am reaching the end of it, but I'm surprised how long it has lasted. Like I said, My hair is about shoulder length, a little shorter, but this foam has really gone a long way. I haven't personally had any major issues with the pump, but I can see how the design could cause issues if dropped, or you get a fluke. Overall I'm still really satisfied with this product. I've used Miss Jessie's Quick Curls, the Deva Curl Styling Cream, the Arc AnGel, and other products too, but I find this one with the One Condition used as a leave in works wonders. I'll be sticking with this for the foreseeable future!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
My new favorite Deva product!  I use just a little on the bottom third of my hair (shoulder length 3C medium density) and let it air dry.  It's lightweight and scrunches out to leave nice, shiny curls.  My hair's moisture and curls are prone to changing with the seasons, but this winter - along with a weekly deep conditioning with mayonnaise - co-washing and this foam are all I need.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This actually really helps define my curls.  I used to use the moisture lock spray, now I use this, or sometimes both, on top of the Angel curl enhancer.  I would definitely recommend this product. I am still struggling with shine, haven't found the right product for that yet, but if I use the NoPoo, the Conditioner, the Angel and this, I get really nicely defined curls.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This worked very well, doesn’t dry out the hair either.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Daughter uses for her wavy hair and it does a great job at cutting the frizz of split ends.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I mix this product with the devacurl ultra defining gel while it is dripping wet, then shake my hair to separate the curls, scrunch-dry my hair with a t shirt and then sit under a diffuser for about half an hour.  This REALLY helps my hair.  I finally have frizz free curls... Warning: Mixing this product with the gel does make your hair a little hard, but what is nice, is you can completely soften it up by pressing on it or scrunching it after your hair dries.  I never have to straighten my hair any more.  Oh and put your hair in a high bun when you go to sleep. When your hair starts to get a little frizzy or droopy the next day, you can reapply some water and restyle it.  (My stylist told me not to wash it every day or it will dry out).
"

"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This stuff works great.  I wasn't sure what to expect because I've used form before and didn't like it.  I am, however, very satisfied.  It calms my thin curly frizzy flyaway hair without being stiff or heavy.  You can comb it if you want to relax it more without it getting frizzy again.  It also adds shine.  Glad I found this product.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"

This is anything but making curls without frizz. My hair looks horrible, frizzy, and the curls are worse than my natural worse. Not worth a penny. I am moving back to John Frieda No frizz which is waaaay better .

I have fine hair and was having difficulty iwth dispersing the DivaCurl Angel (gel) throughout my hair. My hair dresser suggested using this product because the gel comes out in a foam. I love this! I was told it can be refilled with this companies Angel (gel) product and water, once empty. I highly recommend this product!  My curls look so shiny and healthy!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
DevaCurl is by for the best curly hair product that I have ever used and I have tried dozens. I have told tons of people about it and then they start using it too and love it. This product is great for shorter currently here as it doesn't way down the curls and gives it fuller body.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Very fast shipping and great product.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This product is great.  I used to use the AnGel, but my hair would get frizzy by the end of the day.  This product is much better, leaving my curls feeling natural and helping keep the shape.  I have used hundreds of products in the past, and this is by far my favorite.
"

"

I LOVE DevaCurl products for my curly hair. The foam gives my hair a lot of volume and keeps it frizz free during the day. Be careful not to use too much near your scalp though! It can get funky.
"

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This did nothing but tangle my hair, flatten my curls, and create more frizz.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I used devacurl cream and loved it. Just because the cream I thought was a little messy, decided to try the foam. Not a big fan. Makes my hair dry and does not do much to my frizz. I have naturally curly/wavy hair.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I'm very disappointed with this product. I tried this product for a period of about a month between July and August. On the most humid days, it did nothing to reduce my frizziness. If I increased the amount that I applied it left my hair greasy-looking and crispy.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Just switched to using the foam and gel. I like how much fuller it makes it for when I put it up. Easy to use and helps with the frizz

Wanted to find something like Ojan's (discontinued) hydrating volumizing foam.  This is definitely NOT it.  I used it once and it was so sticky I'll never use it again.  Same with their hair spray.  Ug.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This is probably my 3rd order of this product. It leaves my curly hair full and it lasts a whole week without needing to re wet it or anything. One of the best products I have purchased For my curls.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Gives my curls volume, but also makes them more defined. This makes them crunchy when it dries, but then I flip my head upside down and scrunch and they all loosen up and look perfect :)
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
It's tough to bash a product that so many people are having good results with but I've finally reached my limit with DevaCurl's Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam. The pros? It definitely adds some volume (but that's never been a problem for me) and I like the smell. On the flip side, this product does nothing to combat my ruthless frizz and, worst of all, it leaves my hair extremely tangled - to the point where I have to break quite a few strands just to free it up the following day. I should note that I have been using between 2 and 4 pumps. This might be why the product is causing my hair to end up in knots - and I suggest following the lead of those who are only using only ONE pump (dunno...?).I have had so-so results with DevaCurl shampoos and conditioners, however, their styling products just don't work well with my long, thick, curly/wavy, and highly frizzy hair. Seeing as others love DevaCurl, my suggestion is to first go to a local store that offers free samples and test before you buy. Best of luck!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This stuff is hands down one of my favorite styling products.  The gel from DevaCurl doesn't work as well for me.  Smells great and a little goes a long way. I highly recommend switch to DevaCurl products.
"

"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This is exactly what I needed to complete my devalcurl routine. It helps tame the frizz. I thought I could just get away with using the gel, but with my fine and fluffy hair texture, it really started to get frizzy with the wind or laying down. This helps my perfect curls stay perfect longer. Careful not to over apply it, it can weigh hair down!The prices here are better than in store or at the salon, too!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This my favorite volumizing foam. I apply it to my hair while wet and diffuse. It's perfect! Gives me the girl I'm after. It does leave behind a bit of a crunch, but it's considerably less than using a gel or other like product.

This is one of Deva Curl's gluten free hair products and it works wonderfully. It works much better than other curl/scrunch products on the market. My only concern (as with all conventional hair products) is that it contains more potentially harmful chemicals than I would like. I will be exploring organic options in the future. For someone who is not worried about chemicals, it is a top knotch product and I recommend it highly! You have to play around with the right amount to put in wet hair before you scrunch, but then you are good to go.

Still like my other non-name brand products from Walmart (Tresemme). These tend to leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  Not for me. I have semi naturally curly hair and these products are too heavy and do not allow my hair to breathe.

I have naturally curly hair and love Deva products.  My stylist recently recommended this new foam, and I wouldn't think I needed it given that my hair is already quite thick.  But I do find a little bit of it mixed with my gel helps to hold the curl even better than the gel alone.
"

"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I like it.  Foamy and light and smell is kinda citrusy.  I have curly wavy hair prob like a 2b and many products tend to weigh my hair down.  I've been experimenting with the amount of pumps 7 was way too much for my hair which goes to my mid back.  So a little goes a long way I'm now only using three pumps and it gives me softness hold and a tad bit of volume.  Love that it is sulfate free.  My favorite mousse is suave but discovered it had sulfate and so far I'm liking this mousse

"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine curly hair that can get frizzy.This foam definitely works and also has given my hair great volume.  However, your hair will be very crunchy and you  have to wait a long while until it is totally dry to break up the curls (without risk of creating frizz) and fluff.Also, there are problems with the pump where it just stops working after a while. I purchased a travel pump that works better.I like Deva products a lot and regularly use Low Poo Shampoo,  B'leavin' Volumnizer and Deva's hairspray (which also works GREAT to keep eyebrows in place).

I have naturally curly hair. I've been using this product along with Deva shampoo & conditioner for years! My hairdresser (on the East Coast) uses only the Deva line of products in her shop. I recently experimented by using a different shampoo but with the Deva conditioner & Volumizing Foam and it still works great!Now that I live Southern Oregon, I have to buy it online (paying $1 more but saving on shipping fees) as I have Amazon Prime, it was more cost effective to order from them.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
They used it on me on my salon and I liked it.  I mix it with the gel.  I'm thankful that I can get a bit of a price break on Amazon for the Deva products.  I try to buy all of them there first.

I use this and gel, and do much scrunching, and it looks great.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I used this product once & it does not work. Made my hair look & feel terribly dry. Smells horrible too & really over priced for such a horrible product. I had to wash my hair almost immediately after my hair dried & the product set in. My hair was a ball of frizz. I will NEVER again betray Shea Moisture products, lol (they are truly the best in my hair). I decided to try this stuff as I was traveling to Florida & I read this was suppose to be good for high humidity & it is the worse product I've ever tried! Never again! Save your money! This stuff is so expensive & does not work on high porosity 3B/3C curly hair like mine. I'd give it 0 stars if I could!

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I like it but it is a bit too sticky. It leaves my hands REALLY sticky and my hair gets much harder than expected. On the plus side, I no longer use hair spray!

Was too drying for my wavy thin hair.  Might work better on another textured hair. I gave it away to a super curly haired friend.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I guess my hair is just a fuzzy mess since nothing really seems to work.  However, this is much better compared to any of the gel products by Deva.  It doesn't leave the gel/wet look all day!

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I've been using this for the past six months or so and I really love it (AND still have half the bottle left!). I usually use about 4 pumps of this after a medium amount of DevaCurl Utra Defining Gel on super wet hair and then scrunch out the extra moisture with a microfiber towel, let it air dry, and scrunch out the gel crunch. Both products together gives me really good results. This stuff alone is too sticky, and the gel alone doesn't give any volume. I have shoulder-length very soft fluffy curls which tend to droop into waves throughout the day and are easily squashed when I sleep. The addition of the Volumizing Foam helps my curls not to droop so much throughout the day, and also makes it a lot easier to get nice curls in ""day 2"" if I just spray them with water and re-scrunch. Highly recommended for the people who have curls and want MORE volume - not the stereotypical curly girl problem, which makes it hard to find products for us, but this one is a keeper.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have botticelli curls that are thick, but very fine which makes it difficult to find a gel/mousse that doesn't weigh down my hair. It was a bit tricky to learn how to use this product, but I really like it now and have had a number a people comment that my hair is much prettier and more healthy. Tip: when you use this product, make sure to keep it away from the scalp.

Deva Curl products are my weakness, I use this combined with the light gel and a curl styling cream. My curls always come out beautifully and I highly recommend for anyone with curls. This product also lasts awhile, which makes it a good buy even if it may seem pricey!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I use this in combination with a curly hair routine that looks something like this:  I wash with a sulfate free shampoo like No-Poo or Jessicurl Gentle Lather, condition/detangle/comb thru with Biolage Conditioning Balm (I usu buy the generic version here http://www.amazon.com/GVP-Conditioning-Balm-Compare-Biolage/dp/B004FK5XTY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389974148&sr=8-1&keywords=generic+value+product+conditioning+balm ) and then I remove excess water by gentle squeezing out with my hand and then wrapping it in a microfiber towel.  Then I apply some Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner (I am not mixed racially, but rather I am a blonde haired, blue eyed caucasian gal- but still love this stuff!) and flip my hair upside down and comb my fingers through it, making sure I condition all the way to the ends.  Then I apply curl keeper, comb through (still flipped upside down) then scrunch.  Then I apply this product (in a large quantity - several pumps - fine hair needs LOTS of product - way more than course hair!) then I scrunch some more.  I ""plop"" my hair then (check youtube if you don't know what this is), into a long sleeve tshirt and let it sit while I get dressed, apply makeup, chase my toddlers around to get them dressed, make their breakfast, etc.  Right before I am ready to head out for the day, I diffuse it for about 10 minutes and then let it air dry the rest of the way.  Even using a TON of product, my hair is not crunchy.  I have soft, touchable, springy coils.  I have always used mousse and preferred it over very heavy gels which can really weigh fine hair down and not allow the bounce/volume you want, but this one is much better for my hair than others I have used (although I really like the pantene curl line mousse too). I get compliments all the time and also a lot of requests from people asking what I do to get my hair to look so good/behave so well.  I always tell them it is the products and routine because before I figured it all out my hair was an untamed beast!!!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Great product! I have very thick, coarse, curly hair and have used many styling products. This is light weight, yet has good hold. And so far, I'm frizz-free! I use it a little differently than what the directions suggest, and it's working quite well. I use it in the shower on soaking wet hair - after applying leave-in conditioner and SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. My hair is close to the center of my back. I rake 4 pumps of the DevaCurl Volumizing Foam through my hair (mostly mid-shaft to ends). I flip my head over and rake 3 more pumps through the top/front of my hair. While my head is still flipped over, I scrunch my curls upward - toward my scalp. I hope this makes sense. I imagine it does, if you're a curly girl! I'm still waiting to receive the DevaCurl Coconut Curl Styler. I plan to use that in place of the SheaMoisture.

"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I'm baffled by the ""it's not sticky"" reviews.  I have used this off and on with varying results for a while.  I use B'Leave-in and light gel regularly, along with Set It Free on day 2-3.  Was hoping for some soft, cohesive volume with this.  SOMETIMES it works, but it gets sticky and builds up very quickly, which is odd for a product that is supposed to volumize fine hair, right??  Anyway, ONE pump, mixed with water in my palm, seems to do it for me.  It smells great and I'm going to keep trying different way of application because it seems like such a beloved product. :)
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
The only product that gives me long lasting volume
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I could not wear my hair curly and go out in public if it were not for this product. After I wash and condition my hair, while still in the shower with dripping wet hair, I apply this to my hair in sections (two side sections and a back section), scrunch, and then put my hair in a tshirt or microfiber towel to dry a bit. After 15 minutes or so, I dry my hair with a diffuser and presto - frizz free, smooth, curly hair with volume.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I just can't live without this stuff!  It manages to tame my curly/frizzy hair very well along with the DivaCurl Gel.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have 2A or 3B curls (I still haven't figured out which!). This product always feels sticky to me and makes my hair crunchy regardless of how little or how much I use. It seems better if I diffuse, but I prefer air drying my hair. I've been to a DevaCurl certified stylist for years and it still doesn't work for me.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Yes, yes, yes.  Another winner from DevaCurl.  It looks like a liquid but when you shake it, it becomes a foam.  Easy to apply and definitely makes my curly hair behave better (although we all know that curly hair has a mind of its own!)  This is part of my regular routine:  No-Poo, Conditioner, B'Leave In, Set it Free and this Volumizing Foam.  Then you arrange it, diffuse it, shake it out and go...
"

I am really disappointed.  Thi makes my hair stiff and sticky unless i use it as the only product right after washing.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine hair and this weighed it down and made it feel so gross/dirty! I even tried using less and it still was awful. I'm not even sure if it's the real stuff or if it was just old? But I don't want to buy another bottle of it to find out. I love all the other products! I am a huge fan of deva curl all the way!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I think this mousse is great if you are going the no/low poo route, as it doesn't seem to build up on my hair, and it seems to wash out completely.  I was using a silicone based mousse for awhile, and it was really starting to build up on my hair.  It wasn't until I used a clarifying shampoo that I realized how much product was in my hair. My hair was looking about two shades darker for a week or so, and I thought it was due to something in the Devacurl nopoo (it has oils) but it was actually the tre semme heat mousse that I had been using for the past weeks.  It all came out when I used the Devacurl lowpoo, and my hair went back to it's normal color.I actually like the way that silicones make my hair look, but I know they are damaging and hard to wash out, so the Devacurl mousse is a great alternative.  It doesn't work the same way, because it can't, but it does a great job, and it appears to completely wash out with the Devacurl nopoo.If you aren't using sulfate shampoos, it is challenging to find a product that will work, and will also not build up, because most silicones are not water soluble, and they require a detergent to get them out of your hair.  The Devacurl foam washes out with my nopoo, and a little goes a long way.  I was not excited about spending $20 for mousse, when the cheaper silicone products cost about 1/4 as much.  A little of this product goes a long way, and I only need to use one pump every other day, as I have a short bob right now.  I rub the product between my hands and then apply from tips to roots, then scrunch.  It's very easy to use and it smells great.  It keeps my curls together while drying and it helps avoid the dreaded frizz.I'm a big fan of all of the Devacurl line, and hope that they help me to FINALLY grow my hair long :)

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
need to get the whole line ladies!! i have been using it for about a year now (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam, Mister right, and soommmmee times  the set above! It is A MUST TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED! Lucky me my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free, you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have used this product for years, but took about a year off from it.  I decided that it was still the best, but in using the most recent one I ordered (which has new labeling), it is pretty awful.  They must have changed the formula.  Before, it dried your hair a little hard, but when you broke the ""gel cast"", you had defined, pretty curls with good volume.  With this newest bottle, it just makes my hair dry and limp, with sad curls.  I tried to return it (which I am notoriously lazy about doing) but this is not eligible for returns, which makes sense.  I won't be buying this product again.  I'm sad, it used to be so good!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I wish I could use this as a volume boosting dry shampoo type of product on no-wash days, but it only really works on wet or damp hair. I spray my hair with a little water spritzer, but I find that my hair has to be pretty damp for this to work.. one of my favorite things about not washing daily is not having wet hair or heat styling as often. Otherwise.. I love this stuff :)
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This is a great product for my curly hair - honestly, most of the Deva products I've tried are good but this is the one I live by....however, it is on the pricey side so I definitely like to take advantage of it whenever the price falls below $20!!

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have super thin, super curly hair, and this product offers the volume I need without threatening my fabulous curl. My salon uses these products and I was really happy to find them at a reduced rate online. If you have natural curls, I could not recommend the Deva Curl system enough. It is PERFECTION.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Not the best thing ever. Very expensive! If you use too much your hair is gunky and feels awful. The keys is to use a very tiny amount. Not sure if I will repurchase when this bottle is gone... I don't think it's worth the price
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I was a little hesitant to use this product because I know that foams/mousses don't always work for everyone. But for my hair type, it's absolutely perfect. My hair is just above my shoulders and very fine, so I only use 1 1/2 pumps on soaking wet hair. After it dries and I've scrunched it out I'm left with voluminous and defined curls that are full of life! I will occasionally still have a bit of frizz left on my crown but I just touch that up with some DevaCurl Set It Free and I am set. I love that I can get third day hair with this; that's something I've never been able to achieve!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This is a fabulous, lightweight foam for curly/wavy hair. Have occassionally strayed trying to find something better, and have not found it. I've purchased this product probably 25 times. It's amazing. The smell is not my favorite, but after application, the smell is completely gone, so no worries.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
The pump on this is horrible, I get liquid instead of foam.  Not sure if I just received a ""lemon"" because when I buy this at a salon the pump works great and the product is great.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
The perfect foam for my short, curly hair. It doesn't leave my hair sticky like so many mousses and foams do. Easy to reactivate with water the next day. Pleasant light smell. Absolutely worth the cost, I don't think I'll use anything else from here on.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have fine curly hair, that with ArcAngel Gel and B’leave looked full and healthy, with well defined curls. I’ve been using this foam for a week now and it seems as my curls get worse and worse with each use. My hair looks like a hay that’s been through unsuccessful curl ironing, it feels greasy (and I only put 2 pumps, 1 pump doesn’t eliminate freeze) and I wonder if it’s water soluble as the product states it is. I don't think this product is designed for fine hair, maybe for coarser one.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I usually love Deva products and have been using them for years (No poo, angel, and mister right are my favorites) but this one was a big disappointment.  It doesn't really come out foamy at first.  It comes out runny...even when you shake it a lot and then eventually starts to foam.  Waste of product.  But the real problem is that it made my hair feel sticky and then it went straight.  The next day my hair felt thin and dry (and straight).  I've tried it about 10 times now and have had the same result each time.  Wish I could return it but I've had it too long now.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This seems to be the best product for my curls, thus far.  I'll keep buying & using it.  I recommend all the DevaCurl Products.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
This stuff is seriously great. I did a lot of research before buying it, and was on the fence about whether I should use this or the styling cream. I have thin, fine, dry type 3A/3B curls that can't really handle too much product, so I went with the foam even though some reviews said it was sticky or crunchy. I have not found that to be the case at all. I use a few pumps, scrunch and release, and blow-dry about 3/4 of the way dry with a diffuser. My hair has way more volume than it used to and the curls are well defined. I will definitely buy again.I could see how people would complain of crunchiness if they don't scrunch and move their hair around while it's drying. Like most other mousses, you have to kind of play with the curls a little so it doesn't set like a cast.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Did ALL my Christmas shopping on Amazon with all but 1, mishap....the DevaCurl Foam.  It arrived with 3 or 4 other products (all in their own boxes/packages) in a big box, loosely floating around the bottom with  the cap missing.  Naturally it leaked all over the bottom of the box & onto one of the other packages.  Luckily I was able to save the merchandise that it saturated (being a plastic item in it's own box).  A good portion of the foam had been dispensed though.  I called Amazon and they sent a return label (very accomodating as usual), but for a mere $18.00, I decided to just take the hit and keep it myself.  I'm not sure if it's an oversight on the merchant, or whom ever packaged the product to be delivered - possibly a combo of both!!

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"

Good product
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I have weird, thick, out of control, curly hair  - it's straighter in the front with horribly frizzy, tight ringlets in the back and random patches of near-straight hair in the back bottom layer that stick out like the spokes of a wheel if not cut properly. If there's even the slightest hint of humidity that day everything puffs out like an angry cloud and I walk around looking something like a cross between a lion and a poodle with a bad perm. I'm not a girl who messes around too much with beauty products, but even I am appalled by how bad my hair can get and finally I decided to get my hair taken care of. After going through several other products and when I was nearly ready to give up, I went down to a salon specializing in curly hair and was recommended this product.It's nice to finally find something that keeps my hair in line without too much fuss. All I do is leave my conditioner in and apply about 2 pumps of this stuff, scrunching the front and raking through the back with my fingers. It lasts for a while, so if I'm in a real hurry in the morning and don't have time for a shower I still look passable, if not great. If its really humid my hair still frizzes out part way through the day but for the most part this does the trick.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I was really excited to try this new Deva product, which just came out about two weeks ago, and love it so far.  Although it looks like a liquid in the bottle, it pumps out like one of those hand soaps where the liquid turns into a foam. This product is meant to be Deva's version of a mousse, and it gives great volume and definition.I don't use Deva's shampoos and conditioners -- just their styling products -- and find that the FFVF plays well with the Curl Junkie products that I use to cleanse and condition.  I've been using it over the Deva B'Leave In, and it works great to further define my waves.  Since it provides a nice amount of hold, I've found that I don't need to use a gel over it.My hair is a few inches past my shoulders, and I've found that about 2 1/2 pumps is enough to thoroughly coat my hair.  After raking in about four pumps of B'Leave In to my wet hair, I then rake in about 2 1/2 pumps of the FFVF, then use a spray bottle to re-wet my hair and get the clumps to re-form.  Then I scrunch my hair to re-activate the curl.  I do all this bending upside down in the shower.)Before purchasing this, I had been worried that it would be too heavy for my fine waves, but it's not at all; it feels nice and light, and there's no need to ""scrunch out the crunch"" when you use it.  It also gives me great second-day hair, and I haven't had to re-apply it the next day.As with all Deva products, it's also silicone-, paraben-, and sulfate-free, so it works well with the Curly Girl method, which is explained in Lorraine Massey's (the founder of Deva) book Curly Girl: The Handbook.While this is an expensive product, I'm glad I picked it up!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Love love love! I mix this with the ultra gel and scrunch it into my hair when it’s still soaking wet from the shower. After my hair air dries, I scrunch again and my hair is SO SOFT but the curls hold for 2-3 days with just a mist of water. I have very fine, longer 2c/3a/3b hair.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
The dispenser will not release the foam. Liquid squirts out everywhere, but no foam. I've tried shaking it and several other techniques to get the foam.. I've also contacted DevaCurl, but they have no interest in exchanging it for one that does work. Greatly disappointed given the cost of this product. Would have expected at least decent customer service from them.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I am continuously looking for a product that I can rely on to tame my frizzy hair, especially since I don't wash it every day. This product has worked great so far, if I need a little touch up, I just spray a little water in my hair and I'm good to go.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I think this product is great from a curl and volume standpoint.  My stylist turned me on to this after I had just been using the Arc AnGEL.  Completely non-sticky and creates beautiful bouncy curls for me! I don't know that I would call it frizz free for me, but I think that is more about my curls, not the product.  My only gripe is that the seal seems to leak between the base of the lid and the pump.  I have contacted the company and they are sending me a new bottle.  Very quick response from them.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
WHY have I waited until now to try this fabulous foam?? If you're looking for slightly more hold than the gel alone can provide, plus some frizz-fighting action, buy this! I have wavy hair, and the gel itself wasn't providing the best hold. I applied this after doing the no-poo, then one-condition, scrunched in a little gel, towel scrunched, then scrunched in a couple pumps of this- and I'm so amazed with the results :) the smell is fabulous, I couldn't be happier :) and the next day hair doesn't need more than a couple scrunches!
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
I wasn't impressed with this foam. It wasn't so much foam as it was ""suds."" It had a weak sudsy consistency and no lather at all. So it was hard to spread it throughout my hair. Wherever the foam landed was where it stayed, so I'd have to pump out more to cover all of my hair. It also smelled like furniture polish, not something I like in my hair.Most importantly, this product doesn't reduce frizz. If anything, it creates more frizz. I usually end up layering some store bought mousse on top to tame the frizz. I do like some DevaCurl products, but I definitely wouldn't buy this again.

Defines my curls and adds some volume. I would love it if it added even a bit more volume, as my hair tends to fall flatter in the back, but this helps.

DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
Terrible smell.  I have all the other products from diva curl and they smell great.  I'm not so sure this is the real product.
"
DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam 7.5 oz,"
it works ok when I first bought it..but now it makes my hair feel sticky. I have to keep playing with my hair while it dries, otherwise it gets quite hard once your hair is completely dry.

*Let me be clear that I do not think that these or other DevaCurl products are bad, they are just wrong for me.* I am not sure why but Devacurl products disagree with my hair and scalp. My stylist insisted I was using the wrong ones or using them wrong. So after a very expensive haircut and ""Curl Transformation"" she recommended the Decadence line. It makes me itch. I love the smell, I really wanted it to work, I wanted to love it but they really dont leave my hair that soft for the how weighed down it is. I have tried doing the ""noodling"" as I was shown at the salon which leave quite a bit of conditioner in my hair and that is super itchy, heavy and leaves me with no curl definition at all.

I Absolutely love DevaCurl products and being a curly girl, I've tried a ton of products. Although they are pricey, they are so worth it. Amazon makes them much more affordable and this pack is the best pricing you're going to get! I have a hard time with moisture retention and my hair overall looking dull. It is also during the winter months that my hair gets SUPER DRY. The No-Poo and Decadence condition are the only products I have come across that help my hair stay moisturized and healthy. After one use, you feel the difference. After a week, even more so, and after a few weeks, you know the money was well worth it. I recommend these products to EVERY curly girl.The curl cream is just as amazing. A little actually goes a long way and it coats your hair in moisture and when it dries, it leaves your hair looking healthy and shiny!I am a mixed black female with curly hair. If i had to pick a curl type, it would be between 3c and 4a - I thought this information would be helpful to include :)

DevaCurl Bigger Better Basics - Super Curly Care Kit,"
I hated diva curls till the time I learned in devasalon how to use it. Now I can say this is the best brand ever, it gave new life to my dull, dry and fizzy hair. Earlier I was using noo poo shampoo and conditioner, heard a lot about this series so wanted to try , I received this product 2 days back, it was perfectly packed. And with this product there were few free samples which I loved it. Shampoo and conditioner made my hair super smooth and after using super cream and styler my curls came out beautifully.

Really great product I had quite an experience with it My hair felt a little bit other moisturize. On the other hand the other member of my family has his hair all pretty, shiny and healthy after using it. I definitely recommend it for anybody who need a boost of moisture for their curls.

My Cantu system which is a third of the price works much better than this overpriced crap. Dries out my curls and leaves them straight. Legit get Cantu shampoo, conditioner and curl activator for $20 and it’s bomb.
"
DevaCurl Bigger Better Basics - Super Curly Care Kit,"
The shampoo doesn’t clean deep enough, it’s really gently to your hair. I have dry hair and even though it moisturizes I’d rather it to clean it better. The conditioner and leave are moisturizing but not the best ones I’ve tried unfortunately.
"
DevaCurl Bigger Better Basics - Super Curly Care Kit,"
I love these Deva Curl products for my 3C hair. The cleanser and conditioner are  wonderful. The SuperCream is very moisturizing, with a slight hold, smells nice and a little goes a long way.

So far, I’m loving devacurl Products. They left my hair feeling quite soft. Imo, this would be the best starter bundle if a styling gel is added to it. The first thing I noticed was the scent... it smells somewhat... “plain”! I don’t hate it though. I’m just used to the tropical scents of Maui Moisture.Products arrived well sealed, no spillage whatsoever.
"
DevaCurl Bigger Better Basics - Super Curly Care Kit,"
I like the product because my hair became soft and curly. However, I think the products are a bit expensive, and it is better to buy a big volume of product to add value to your money.

DevaCurl Bigger Better Basics - Super Curly Care Kit,"
I searched for many years for a product that would make my 3c/4a (crown) hair soft and manageable. I’ve been natural for over 10 years. This is by far the best product I’ve used. My hair is so soft and manageable. I comb through it in a matter of 2-3 minutes (it was previously about 30 minutes in multiple small sections). It is so moisturized I can actually dry comb my hair without spritzing it with water. I was never able to do that before. My stylist recommended this product about a year ago and I’m so glad she did. I am actually retaining length since my hair is not dry and broken off. I LOVE this product.
"

 Love the way Deva curl works in my hair! My curls are softer and healthier.
"
DevaCurl Bigger Better Basics - Super Curly Care Kit,"
At first I loved this product. But the longer I used it the more my hair seem to build a “tolerance” to it and my hair became  frizzy when using it.
"
DevaCurl Bigger Better Basics - Super Curly Care Kit,"
I've lived with my frizzy dry curly hair my whole life, constantly searching for a product that would tame the mane. Deva not only tames it, but what used to be an embarassing mob, is now my crowning achievement... i have soft ringlets that drape beautifully down my back. I finally love my locks and compliments are continuous... thank you Deva for ending the frizz fight and delivering a knock out product!!!!
"

My daughter has been using this product for months and had the tightest bounciest curles and now they are not so curly and not as pretty as they used to be. Not happy at all
"

DevaCurl has some great products, this being one of them.  I do have curly hair but tend to blow it dry with a round brush. My thick hair is soft and shiny with this no poo moisturizing product.

DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
My hair is very fine and slightly wavy. If I put a tiny (smaller than a dime) amount of this on my hair soaking wet and follow with a bit of mousse, I can use a diffuser and get amazing curls! I like the Quenching Coconut Curls Mousse best - it's light enough to give a bit of hold on my fine hair, while the Diva Curls Mousse is too heavy
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I follow CGM to the letter, but only recently started using Deva Curl products. The summer humidity in Florida is always at least 5000%, and this stuff just doesn't cut it... Even with using an ample amount, I'm still a frizzy mess within minutes of stepping outside. It smells nice and isn't heavy, greasy, or crunchy, so two stars. Maybe it will be good to use during fall or winter, but for now, I'm going back to my huge $2 bottle of LA Looks gel.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I've used many DevaCurl products and this is one of my favorites. I run a bit of this through my hair while it's still wet in the shower, then dry with a microfiber fleece towel. My hair dries tussled and wavy, and does not feel dry or coarse. Very little frizz or flyaways. I highly recommend for air drying wavy hair.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Worth the money!!!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I don't do much with my hair. But I like my curls to actually curl nicely. This is amazing. Leaves my hair soft, and the curls are much less frizzy (I live in Northwest Florida and it's even humid when it's cold here!). Very pleased with this product!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
At first, this product seemed like a dream come true. It smelt pretty good, held my hair in it's luscious curly state, and lasted for up to three days. However, I began to notice severe hair fall that came out in large clumps during my shower. Then I was realizing my hair began to grow brittle and would break off over the slightest tension. Just for the review, it is important to note I do not dye my hair nor do I use any heat styling products or harsh shampoos/conditioners. Everything I use is very natural and health conscious. I took a leap of faith with the Diva Curl Wave Maker (as it is not completely natural) and I could not be more unsatisfied. When I finally boiled down my hair loss to this product I stopped using it and my hair fall stopped within a few weeks. I am so so so sad over losing so much hair and really disappointed as I recently heard Ayesha Malik, the youtube hair guru, has also had serious issues with Diva Curls' products on her hair. Which her and India Batson's reviews for Diva Curl were the only reason's why I trusted the brand in the first place :/ So bummed and really sorry for Ayesha. I want the company to do well, but this was a doozie.
"

I really wanted to like this, but the feeling it left in my hair afterwards was gross! I might have doing it wrong, but it just bothers me. And I also don’t wear much product, so I might not be used to it.

I'm given this a 5* because my hair visible had life and that after pic was 3hr later still not flat. First time use about a dime size and my hair was as damp as should be was actually dry then rewet I have to say so far I really like this for my thin lifeless hair for an all natural look
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I wanted to return this but they won’t take it back and I cannot even find a way to write to the people I bought it from.  The product is awful.  I have used most of the other deva products and love them. This one is terrible. Sticky and adds no wave or body to the hair.  My daughters tried it as well and felt the same way.  I feel like product satisfaction is important.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
You can’t go wrong with diva curl. This wave maker helped define my curls and make them last longer than without this product. I would recommend this smooth wave maker.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Great product! You don't need much of it to do a good job. I have shoulder length hair and a size of a nickel does the job! Product does not make hair sticky or stiff.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have a tighter wave pattern and this doesnt hold my curls tight enough together. Would be great for people with a more loose beachy wave pattern
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have very temperamental wavy/curly hair, a lot of products weigh it down or make it very frizzy. This product does NOT! My hair is soft and the texture is wonderfully enhanced. I pair it with Aussie frizz-free gel and it works perfect! Buy it here, don’t buy it anywhere else. It is almost 26 bucks on DevaCurl’s site and at Sephora. (East Coast prices)
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I used Deva Curl Wave Maker for several months. Then I noticed my hair had started falling out! I have since found two other people who used this product and had the exact same experience. I stopped using it and slowly I began to lose less hair. Now the problem is almost gone.  I've thrown away the remaining product. I will never buy another Deva product. This stuff is AWFUL. Save your hair; don't buy it!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have wavy long hair and this is great for not weighing it down and it gives good texture!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This made my thick, wavy hair curl nicely but it made me break out pretty bad along my hairline and on my neck. The search continues. I think this is a good product if you don't have sensitive skin and have heavy and wavy hair that needs some control/frizz management. I like that it's a cream instead of a gel, my hair never felt crunchy or sticky with this in it.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Absolutely love this stuff. I have very thin, fine hair and it actually gives it a bit of  volume and curl without making it crunchy. Will order again and again!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Gives me fabulous curls sometimes, other times it's a bit too heavy. I think that might have more to do with how often I get it cut, but I've found it's best to use this when it's freshly sheared.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I purchased this along with the Ultra Defining Hair Gel to use together. I tried the combo 3 times and my hair felt really dried out. So I experimented and stopped using the gel and just used this product alone and I got a nice soft wave with a slight cast and no crunch. Ended up returning the gel because it made my hair feel icky.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Didn’t do anything to my hair but smells nice. My hair might be too damaged for this type of gel. I would say my hair is wavy more than curly. It defined the waves maybe 25%. I really thought it would make more of a difference considering how much their products cost.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I was hoping this would enhance my waves but it weighed down my wavy/curly hair. Hated the result even after scrunching it into wet hair. And I didn't even put too much.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
LOVE! I have ""beach"" wavy hair that is heavy and thick and goes flat/straight by end of day without the right product. This stuff keeps my waves, is not sticky, thick, or cakey.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This product in no way eliminates frizz. If anything, it makes my hair frizzier and less soft than without the product. This brand gets too much hype for mediocre to ineffective products. I’ve had more success with much cheaper brands available in grocery stores.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Yuck. This product left a greasy film on my hair. On a warm day, the product started to run off of my hair and coat my neck. It did nothing for my curls, either, but made them heavy and almost straight. Very disappointed.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Absolutely LOVE this product.  I already have natural curly hair it seemed the curls as their own brain. Lol did why THEY wanted to do. I found this product and now my curls mind me. Lol. I’ve had sooo many compliments on my hair. Not sticky at all. Don’t need to use much.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Pretty good product. Not much control. If you use a lot of it, then layer devacurl gel over it, it works better
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
It was lightweight and smells nice, however, it did nothing for my hair. It was more frizzy than if I let it just air dry without anything in it. I was very hopeful when I saw this product, but it was a huge disappointment. I have naturally wavy, fine hair that is very long.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I agree with the other reviews. So far this is the best product for encouraging frizz free waves that dry soft instead of crunchy.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
this stuff is amazing! it gives me curls that are nice and soft and fluffy looking while also being defined. personally i like to pair with the light defining gel to max definition (just make sure the scrunch out the gel so its not crunchy)
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Pretty disappointed in this product. All the hype for devacurl for a mediocre product. I’ve bought 3 devacurl products and none of them worth it.
"

made my hair really greasy and did not help much for my curls but now that I have shorter hair I use to style since its really heavy, but smells amazing

This doesn't work on my hair type apparently.  It makes my hair feel dry and looks like a birds nest.  Took my waves to stringy and looks horrible.I have low porosity hair and this was recommended but I will have to find another product.
"

This stuff is the absolute best!! Makes your hair feel fantastic too!!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Forms good curls. No sticky residue. Really nice work.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Semi-small but the product is good enough that you use very little and it goes a long way. I love the way it smells and doesn’t make my hair hard or sticky like some wave or curl products.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Love it. Effortless. Doesn't weigh down my hair, gives me nice scrunch waves without feeling hard and krinkly like gel.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Product does nothing for my hair i have 3b type curls
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This product is amazing for my hair. I have curly/frizzy hair and it makes it more curly and less frizzy. Also, it's recommended by my hairdresser who is very knowledgeable.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
An absolute fav product.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Great product! Love that it leaves hair soft, not crunchy like mousse. Will definitely purchase again!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Leaves hair dry and crunchy . And the item is not returnable - I did not bother to read the fine print because who knew there are now items on amazon that can’t be returned even if they are of bad quality
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Newbie to CG method but holy crap!!! I didn’t know my hair could feel so soft with a styler.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
A little thick but when applied to wet hair makes waves really pop!! Do your research!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Horrible item! Hair loss and itchy scalp! You cant even request a refund and return since it's an eligible for return. What kind of company does this???? Horrible DO NOT PURCHASE!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
excellent product!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I was looking for a product to help define my curly/wavy hair. This is actually pretty good frizz protection but makes my hair flatter and straighter than it is naturally.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Really didn’t do much for my hair.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Didn't work for me, made my hair sticky and heavy, with lesser amount made my hair look dry. Disappointed.The shipping was on time, came intact
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I really love this stuff! Makes my curls defined without being crunchy.

Doesn’t work.

"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Have had curly/ wavy hair my whole life... tried a million products and this is by far my favorite. Gives me awesome curls, no grease or crunch.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Don’t like it nothing happens to my heir
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have wavy 2B/2C hair. This didn't really separate my curls like I wanted for the price. And my hair was still frizzy afterwards. I tried using more product, but it made my hair crunchy.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Works fine but I don't love the smell of their products. Not sure if it's worth the price.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I only wish it was more product  for what I payed.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I could tell a noticable difference in curl of my waves when i used product vs. not using. I will continue to use product.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Definitely helped enhance my waves without making my hair look greasy. Worked best when I applied it to just barely damp hair
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Does not work
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Excellent product for curly hair!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I use these products for my curly hair and haven't found anything this good in years. I would highly recommend the entire product line.

Love my wavemaker! It's a must for anyone with wavy hair

It is my favorite product for wavy hair!Soft and wavy with no frizz definitely gets 5 stars! You

Good product
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
How did I ever survive without Devacurl?? This product along with the Lowpoo and One Condition Delight have changed my hair so dramatically I literally still c any believe it. I get compliments on my curls all the time now. My curls are so much more defined, and still touchable. Wavemaker is a cream, not a gel. I apply to sopping wet hair while still in the shower and scrunch with a t shirt. The product is so lightweight it disappears in your hair and you’re left with beautiful defined waves without the crunch or sticky feeling. I can still run my hands through my hair without causing frizz or getting caught up in a bunch of goo. Love LOVE Devacurl!!
"

This stuff is amazing for curly hair!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
One word......AMAZING!!!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Pretty pricey stuff that didn't do much more than a cheap supermarket product, although I like that my hair wasn't sticky after using it.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Not a product for everyone.  I have waves, not curls, and fine hair. My waves just became frizzier and less manageable. I even got my hair cut and tried the product again with no success. I like many of the deva products, but it is not a one-size-fits-all thing.  Oh well
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Great product! I've used it a few times now to refresh my curls and it works really well! I have fine, curly hair and I'm really impressed with this stuff.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
It drys my hair and leaves it stringy and super frizzy. My hair is like wavy curly with a lot of volume and I was hoping this would define my curls and make them look super nice. I've heard good things about the product but it really disappointed me so I don't understand. I might have gotten a different formula or something. Not sure but this flopped for me and it's upsetting I can return this.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Does not feel like the same stuff I bought in the store. It is much more oily and does not hold the curl at all. It doesn't even smell the same.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I love the feel of this product. Not stiff or sticky. Leaves my waves feeling soft and manageable!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I am in love with this product.  The light hold is does what no other product can do for my wavy/curly hair.  I just hope they never stop making it!!!!!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
The product works.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Great new product

Exactly as advertised, no catch. Awesome product!!

Love the light texture and control of the product.

This product is good for after shower days.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Makes my hair really wavy and curly! It is worth it!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I thought this product was going to be light weight and give me more fullness ... my hair was super flat and my hair is pretty dry normally this product made my hair super greasy!!!! Disappointed ! I usually love devachon
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
it drys my hair
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I am still finding the right amount for my should length hair to much and it's crunchy to little and it doesn't do anything. I haven't tried with a diffuser so that may make a different I air dry my wavy hair
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Seems to work pretty well and doesn't take much product for my very long, thick hair.  I have very curly hair and this controlled the curl without being crunchy.  I like other Deva Curl products better.  My biggest concern is that you could tell it had been opened and some was missing as the silver seal on the inside was off but someone had attempted to put it back in place. Once they are off they don't go back on.  Although some was missing, I don't think it was that much but very disappointing. I will buy from a store from now on and not Amazon.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Smells nice. Might be a little too mild for my curls. Probably my mistake.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I've been using DevaCurl products for many years and as a wavy/curly girl I love the new products that are specifically made for wavy hair. This Wave Maker is awesome although I do find that on more damp days (I live near the beach) and when it's really super dry (SoCal Santa Ana conditions) I have to switch back to my go-to fav combo of Coconut Creme & Light Gel mixed with a little argan/coconut oil to keep my hair from frizzing. So for me this product is weather dependent. Also, I have noticed that if I don't use the exact right amount my hair can feel a little sticky. But overall I love it...so easy to be able to use just one product at least some of the time!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Doesnt make waves, makes my hair frizzy and look like a bird nest. Even when used with other recommend products like the ultra defining gel.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Note: I have medium length hair with a medium weight. It tends to be pretty frizzy.I used a bottle with a sprayer on it in place of a shower (my hair tends to retain water really well and takes a while to dry even when loose), to dampen my hair before applying the cream. After working it in, scrunching it, and giving it some time to dry, I ended up with some loose beach wave style curls.The cream has no real noticeable scent once it is on your hair (though initially, it does have a faint, almost citrusy scent when you open the tube). There was a slight change in the texture of my hair but by no means was it 'crunchy'. It still felt light, not oily, or weighed down. My frizz, for the most part, was tamed, though I did have to use some anti-frizz spray closer to my roots where I didn't focus on using the cream as much.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
not doing what supose to do , do not buy
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I’ve used DevaCurl’s low poo, One Condition, B’Leave In, frizz free foam, and gel with good results, but this is awful. I have fine, high porosity 2b/c waves and thought this might help boost volume. It did provide some texture as promised, but it left a gross residue In my hair and did nowhere near what B’Leave In or the volumizing foam do to fight frizz, and add shine and bounce. I had big, somewhat flat, dirty-feeling hair after this. I’m glad I tried a free sample, because I would be bummed to have paid for this product. If you have wavy hair and want something to help give messy, beachy texture this might work for you, but I’m looking for defined, untangled waves and curl and this is just not it.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Received from Sephora as a sample. I've tried so many products to let my hair air dry and have beachy waves. This product is perfect for my heavy, medium length hair. Leaves it super soft, not crunchy and wavy/textured. Scrunch when you put it in but don't touch it a lot. It takes my hair 24 hours to air dry and it's even better 2nd day. Often mix with IGK's coconut hair gel too. Nickle sized amount of one or both and go to town. Obsessed!!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I washed with aveda shampoo for curly hair and used the dermorganic masque.  This product smells sooo GOOD...like skittles but more natural. If I could I’d give it 3 1/2 stars because it does not always leave my hair like this. If I use too much it leaves my hair a  bit sticky and weighed down. It seems that I have to use the right amount in order for it to work. I’ll update later.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I bought this product without knowing much about it except for the fact that I wanted my cyrls to be fluffy, pronounced and  frizz free and bouncy.  I have a very asymmetrical haircut and the long curls on the left side of my face are very different from the other side . So  this product is totally amazing! I can feel the difference when I touch my hair ...it’s light and  feels like there’s absolutely no product in it and gives it an amazing amount of body. I will always use this product  along with the no Poo shampoo and the delight conditioner my hair has been transformed !!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
My cosmetologist gave me a small packet of Whip It Good Wave Maker - I have short not very curly hair.  I use about a pea size dab spread on my fingers while my hair is wet - no towel drying. It makes the curl and style stay until I wash my hair again.  I just scrunch my hair a little, don't really style or comb it otherwise.  If this is the same product, the best ever.  I never used product in my hair until now.  This stuff has made a believer out of me.  I hope this tube is the same.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have fine, wavy 2b hair, and this product is a complete disaster for me. I've tried this alone and with other products, and this always gives me a frizzy, stringy mess. Maybe fine with other people's hair chemistry, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have curly hair and for some reason I haven’t been able to find that perfect product that doesn’t make my hair sticky, crunchy or blah but I have now!! My hair is awesome and the curls are so bouncy LoVe it!!!!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
A while ago, I received a small bottle of this as a sample from Ulta, I believe. It is amazing stuff. I can truly spend less than 5 mins on my hair and run out the door if I’m in a crunch. When it dries, I have soft waves with little frizz. It’s worth every penny! Sleep on it and it’s even cuter the next day.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This is fantastic for wavy hair - light enough not to weigh it down.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have purchased generic brushes before and they fell apart within days. These have lasted just as long as the  manufacture's expensive toothbrushes at a much lower cost.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I’m not sure whether it was this product, or the matching deva low-poo & conditioner (or all three) but I’ve never seen my hair this curly!! I’m seeing a ton of definition and A LOT less frizz! I didn’t change my routine at all, just washed, let the condition sit a few minutes, combed with a wide-toothed brush, pressed extra water out with a t-shirt and scrunched this into my hair. This is after one use- I’m excited to see what my hair is like in a few months when this stuff is gone! It smells good too!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I was very optimistic when I first purchased this product because many people just love this brand.  Unfortunately, this did not work for my hair at all.  It leaves it looking dry and frizzy.  I tried a much cheaper alternative brand, Cantu, and it was a completely different experience.  Love the Cantu products.  I don't think Deva products are bad, but be aware that they will not work for all hair types.  Before you buy it, if you can sample it somehow, it might save you a lot of money.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have wavy/curly hair and was excited to try this after reading eviews. However, I couldn't see that it made any difference at all to my hair. I thought maybe I wasn't using it properly, so I asked my Devacurl stylist about it. She doesn't recommend it either. She had high hopes for it, but doesn't see results. Keep your money. I do love One Condition and Arc Angel gel, though.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Curly hair takes work! I saw the promo video for the product and loved the end result so much I couldn’t help but purchase it. The first time I used it, it wasn’t so successful, it wasn’t until after I followed these steps that I got the result I wanted:Wash with DevaCurl Low-poo (or no-poo, up to you)RinseCondition with DevaCurl (your choice)Run fingers through hair to bind curl patternPart hair (before rinsing)RinseADD PRODUCT TO DRENCHED HAIRDry with Devatoweland air dry of diffuseMy hair looks amazing every time! I use a little bit of spray oil afterwards to tame flyaways, but other than that- no other products are needed and my hair looks even better the next day!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have Wavy 2A hair and have been looking for something I can use to do my hair quickly and that will bring out the natural curl. This is the best I've found. I put some on starting about 1/2 way down the length of my hair to the ends, usually when it's still wet, and then I scrunch as my hair dries naturally. It's an easy, quick way to do your hair if you have hair like mine-- s-shaped waves that start around the ear and below.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I dont really need to write a review about this prpduct.. i think its well known that its amazing. Holds curls SO well and not crunchy and it doednt cause the knots that some styling gels will. Love love love.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This smells very nice. I have wavy, thin hair (but lots of it) and this is a bit heavy for me. I use a teeny amount. If I use more than about a bean-size amount it tangles my hair and makes it impossible to braid or comb the next day. It’s good to have around for those days when I want to have my hair down and I need to let it air dry.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I've been a fan of devacurl for a while now. I used to get the Arc gel, and wanted to try out another product from their line. After reading some reviews, I decided to give this a try and it's amazing! Leaves your hair feeling so light, like there's no product in it at all. Doesn't weight the hair down or make it greasy. Definitely buying this again.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
There was so much hyper for this product but it didn't work well for my hair, by itself at least. It actually feels like my hair is being more straightened than wavy. Still trying to test the waters with this for the past two months but so far it's been alright. Interested in trying other deva curl products.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I absolutely love it. I'm starting my curly girl journey and I'm a month in and I kept hearing good things about this product and got it. When i tried it, my waves had more definition and smelled good lol. I used this product with the defining gel and it worked so well!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
My wavy hair loveees this. Always helps me get definition without making my hair feel tacky. Note: A little product goes a long way.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have really long wavy hair.  I was hoping this would boost my curls.  It does not.  It weighs it down more and makes it flat.  I probably just have the wrong hair type for it.  I will not be buying anymore of these products.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This is a great Deva product if you have curly hair it is a must
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Amazing!! My curl has never looked better and completely frizz free.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Apply on wet hair.. do not use towel to dry hair, comb with fingers and let it air dry.. works wonders.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This product made my hair fall out, damaged my curl pattern and gave me a itchy, flaky scalp. It was great the first 2-3 times I used it then I lost half of my hair in the front. I would advise against anyone using it. I don’t want this to happen to one more person.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This stuff works great. Very nice for scrunching wet hair. A great alternative to gel products.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
My favorite curl product!!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This product really enhances my curls.  My hair stylist first introduced me to it and I am hooked!  There is no frizziness, my curls look better and they last all day.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
My daughter has thick, wavy hair and we have tried everything. Nothing defines her waves more than this product. She is a fan for life, and I am just grateful to stop searching. Fantastic and highly recommended.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Love this product! Its definitely helped with making my curls/waves bigger and smoother. Its not a huge bottle though, and I personally end up using a fair amount of product, so it can get a bit more expensive than some other drug-store products. For me, its worth the price!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
It didn't really help my wavy, frizzy hair. Was hoping I'd gain more manageable curls but didn't work on my hair.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
LOVE this best product iv had
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Doesn't do much for my short wavy hair but I prefer it over gel and mousse. Maybe it works best when using the DevaCurl blow dryer. I would like to find a product that works by just applying it to wet or dry hair without all the extra details.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
If you have wavy or curly hair and you want to create/maintain the latest styles, this stuff is magic!  I highly recommend it.  You only need a small amount, and you get great results.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Excellent product - does not weigh your hair down or make it feel sticky.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Works great on my 2b wavy hair!  The feel is light and textured, but not sticky. Not a big fan of the scent, but it fades.  Used with a deva towel and a good squish, and it keeps curls together well!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I didn't really care for this product because it did not give me the curl I was wanting and I don't like the feel the product gives your hair when you put it in.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Great for my curls but can leave buildup
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Total control without weighting my hair down.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Best hair EVER!!! My hair never frizzes and looks naturally beachy with this amazing stuff. Plus, you only need a little bit. Smells great.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
It's nicer than some of the other products out there but I'm still not completely in love with this brand.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Great product....love the texture of product. will buy again!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have fine, swavy hair, and this is my favorite styling product for creating loose curls.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have very low wave hair. I was using deva curl one condition followed by the ultra hold gel. But I only need this product. I use no poo, I don't condition even if hair feels rough. I then scrunch out all the water and comb this product through with my fingers, removing any tangles and coating my hair. I then scrunch with my fingers, again with a towel and it gives soft beautiful waves. Pretty good.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Doesn't to the job I was hoping and leave my hear feeling like it has a ton of product in it at the end of the day! Doesn't add the definition that I was hoping for I have curly/wavy hair
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Works ok

Loved it. Made my waves look so good and so soft
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Thank you for fast shipping.  Great product!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
This doesn't work for me. I have wavy/loose curls and it seems to heavy for my hair....it pulls my waves out making them straighter than I want. I feel like this product is a bit greasy feeling as well.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Loved it.  It make my hair soft and easier to comb through.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Recently had my hair dresser use this on me and I wanted it! My hair was soft, not frizzy and so shiny! Perfect for fine wavy hair that needs some protection from the elements.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
works well

"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
My Deva stylist used Wave Maker on me two weeks ago during my last hair cut and I LOVED it! It smells great and adds some more pep to my waves which can be easily lost when using the Deva Gels. I use a cocktail of the Light Gel and Ultra Gel. Now I've added Wave Maker to my routine.I apply it to my hair after I've shaken out some of the water. Use about a 1 inch dollop of the product, rub it into both hands and apply to your waves. For application, I don't apply it like I do the gels. I smooth Wave Maker gently over my waves and since I have thick hair i'll lift up some of it to get underneath the top layer of my hair for even distribution. I also like to use a little bit extra on the crown of my head so that I can get more volume when using clips.Then I apply a cocktail of the Light Defining Gel and Ultra Defining Gel (equal amounts of each) in the typical fashion.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Love this product!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Not sticky but holds great
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I absolutely love this cream. It doesn't weigh my hair down or make it greasy, and it smells lovely! It creates soft, natural wave definition. And the best part is that you only need to use a little bit each time, so the product lasts and is well worth the price!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Left a film on my hair and made it very dry. I didn't see any benefit. I've used many Deva products before. I'm not sure if the formularies are changing, or my hair just isn't taking to the products anymore, but I'm about ready to change to something else completely. Evidently this seller didn't accept returns.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have been buying Deva products for almost 15 years and very few have been disappointing.  This curl enhancer is great.  It doesn't leave my curls crunchy like the Deva Angel gel.  Smells nice too.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Product smells nice, but doesn't work any miracles on my fine hair. I like to scrunch and air dry, but this product tends to make my hair greasy/weighed down before the end of the day.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Not impressed. Love DevaCurl, but this did not work for my fine, wavy hair. Upset that the seller does not accept returns. Do not recommend.
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Although I absolutely love Deva Curl Products, this was an eh for me. My hair is very fine and it's a bit light at the crown, this sort of weighed my hair down. If you're looking for gorgeous girls, definitely try the DevaCurl Gel (light hold). You will thank me!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
I have a love/hate relationship with Deva products.  I have fine, 2C hair, and the various gels can make my hair feel too gummy and tacky.  I go to a stylist who just cuts curly and wavy hair using the Deva Cut method, and she used it on me.  I loved how my hair turned out so much that I bought a tube.My stylist's assistant said that this product should be used after squeezing out some of the water in your hair (unless like many of the other Deva products, which should be applied to soaking wet hair).  Following her instructions, I spread about an 1"" of this on my finger (I'm growing out a short cut, and the back of my hair is just at my shoulders), smoothed it through my hands, and then leaned over and applied to the right side of my hair, and then scrunched it in.  I then have been doing the same on the left side.  I also put a light coating over the first three or so inches of my hair; I have to be careful not to use too much there or it makes my hair look greasy.  I've also been following it with either Deva Arc Angel or Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee, and then clipping to dry.While you can definitely feel the product in your hair, it's not too tacky-feeling.  I really like this so far!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
My curls are so soft and not frizzy!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Love it!!!!!!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
The best thing after years using styling cream + angell. This is a new product and really makes what it promises: it feels like there’s nothing in your hair at all!
"
DevaCurl Wave Maker 5oz,"
Really helped define my waves with close to zero frizz. For my hair, that's worth celebrating. I purchased the styling cream too and I used that first, then the wave maker followed by a bit of gel and A LOT of scrunching. I'm very impressed with the results! I recommend finishing with a diffuser. These two products from devacurl are my new go-to for a flawless wash-n-go which has been elusive for me until now.

Had to return it for the perfume smell - it about knocked me over before I even took it out of the box.  This might not be a problem for some but I am sensitive so it had to go back without even trying it!

I have hair that tends to wave in random, awkward places if it doesn't have help.This. Didn't work. At ALL. And couldn't return it.Try something else.

I ordered this product, along with the Ultimate Defining Gel, the No-Poo Cleanser, and the One Condition, after my salon gave me a sample kit to try. I have to say, this is the first time that I've actually been confident in my hair and the amount of time and stress that it saves me in the morning is invaluable. This morning, for the first time I used the gel and the texture whip after washing and conditioning my hair with a different shampoo and conditioner, and they still worked great, so don't let it hold you back if you can't or don't want to buy a whole set of Devacurl products.It's pricey, and being someone who has never paid a lot for hair products it was hard to lay down this much cash for one item. But as other reviewers point out, you don't need to use a lot and a little goes a long way. Plus, the peace of mind really is worth a lot in the end. Highly recommend!

If you like stringy looking hair, then you will like this. Wave Maker is a mousse and it does what mousses do... make hair look stringy.Its usually the fine haired people who use mousses because they are light weight. I can always spot a person who uses mousse...their hair looks pathetically stringy.  I used it this morning and was drying my hair and it was looking more and more stringy. So, I had get back into the showerand start over. My favorite for my fine wavy curly hair is b'leave in and ultra defining gel. Then I get clumpy curls. Much better.

Until I found Deva Curl, my menopausal hair was a frizzed mess (never had curly hair before).  Wavemaker has turned out to be my all time favorite styling product.  For those who have given it poor reviews, it may not be the correct product for you, or it may be that you aren't applying it correctly. There really is an art to this stuff if you read the book (Curly Girl)  or go to the Deva Curl website.But the best advice I can give you is to suggest you see a stylist who is trained by Deva Curl to cut curly hair-- by far the best cut my curly/wavy hair has ever had.  That person can show you how to apply the product, and which product is best for your hair.

Smells amazing but it’s a little too lightweight for my hair. I’d like something a little bit more conditioning maybe with more hold

I received a sample from my hairdresser...and WOW! A little goes a long way. I've been using Deva Curl products for about 5 years now..and although I do love their products...I've struggled to find a good balance for a styling creme/gel. My hair is very fine and thin...so generally speaking its hard to find a product (even when using a tiny bit) that doesn't weigh my hair down, or leave some frizz behind. I have finally found the perfect styling product in Wave Maker. This gave me tons of volume and no frizz. I've found their Delight line has worked great for me as well.

Never has my second day hair looked better!  I have fine hair, but a lot of it.  I've used it 4 times now and it doesn't take very much product.  I was worried about the price for such a small bottle, but it sprays out in a fine mist.  I only need 5 sprays around my head and I'm good to go. No frizz.  No crunch.  No overpowering smell.  Does not weigh my hair down.  I'm definitely ordering another bottle.

I usually don’t post many reviews unless I feel the product is somehow deceiving. This is the worst hair product I’ve ever used, and I have used a lot. The first photo is my hair without the product and second is with it. It initially made my hair so sticky and dry I had to shower twice to get it out of my hair. It felt like I had just sprayed my hair with hairspray. I like the Deva Curl shampoo and super cream do I thought this would be good too, but I was very wrong. It has been several days since using the spray and I can still feel my hair is dryer than normal even after washing and conditioning it. It did not add moisture nor did it control frizz. I will definitely think twice about buying any other Deva Curl product without my stylist’s recommendation or having her try it on me in the salon first.

This is a MUST HAVE for curly girls!!! I can be on my fourth post-wash day and use this stuff to help freshen-up and re-style! Dry shampoo for curls that actually smells good and dampens hair!! I use it along side water and completely wet my hair and reapply styling products (a little less than normal) and style as usual. Literally amazing!!! Definitely authentic as well. I’ve read some reviews saying their DevaCurl products aren’t authentic but everything I’ve bought on amazon is cheaper than from Sephora or online and is authentic.

I have used the curl revitalizing lavender spray by deva curl and wanted to see if this would have a little more oomph. The lavender spray smells good but doesn’t do much. The scalp and curl revitalizer is the real thing. It actually plumps up my curls and doesn’t leave a gross residue on my scalp, hands or roots. I recommend to anyone who wants a quick curl refresh on second day curls or after a hard workout.

Contains a non-water soluable wax, and therefore is not technically CGM approved. I have 3a hair. That being said, the scent is nice and I do use it to seal the ends of my hair where the most damage is, which helps cut down on frizz when it's humid out. Also works well for providing solid curl definition for an end-of-day refresh. I have not found it useful for a full refresh as the was makes my scalp look greasy and at that point it's easier to just shower.I would recommend to other 2c-3b girls that want to lock in curl definition.

I use this product to refresh between washing and it works great.  I think of it as dry shampoo for curly hair that works in reverse by adding moisture.  It is very fragrant but dissipates quickly.

I really like to use this product along with the Mister Spray. It really does help to delay wash day for at least 2-3 days or so. I have 3c hair and usually wear it in a wash-n-go. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it can leave the hair a bit hard and crunchy with a hairspray feel. I imagine that’s what keeps the hold though.  For that reason, I always mix it with the Mister Spray to get more moisture.

I was a little skeptical since I've found most sprays don't really make much of a difference, but this one revitalizes my curls, minimizes frizz and is great for adding volume at the scalp. With this spray, I can wear my day 3 hair down and even make it last for a 4th day!

I took this from the marketing to be a product to kind of replace dry shampoo for us curly girlies. I've been doing the curly girl method for a few years now, and still my hair really kind of oily by day 3. I have to use dry shampoo, or it's stringy and limp. I tried it today on day 2 hair and I feel like I dumped oil on my scalp. I have to almost wipe the residue off my hand if I touch my roots at all. I want to give it more stars as I've only used it once, and maybe I put too much in or something?? But I'm skeptical. I'll try it again if I don't have to go anywhere, but it looks like I'll use this as a curl refresher (just on the ends)...if I'm lucky. But right now I really hate it.

DevaCurl High Shine Multi-Benefit Oil 1.7 oz,"
I have long 3c/4a/4b coily hair. My hair veers closer to the kinky side of curly and I face a daily challenge from frizz and dullness. Frizz aside (it is what it is), dullness is something I can address because its hard for type 4 hair to be and stay shiny. I want a product that keeps my curls looking their best.Pros:This makes my 4a/4b hair shinyThe smell is wonderfulThe shine lasts a few daysCons:The price. This is overprices oil sheenThe ingredients. Mineral oil is 1 of the top 5 ingredients. I'm sure its water soluble and made from high end ingredients, but after all the mineral oil Ra-ta-ta in the natural hair community I'm surprised to find it in this product.Overall:I will not repurchase. I can get products heavy (or light) with mineral oil and silicones anywhere for far less than $30. At the end of the day its just not worth the price tag.

DevaCurl High Shine Multi-Benefit Oil 1.7 oz,"
First I want to say that if I could do half stars, I would give 4 and a half.This oil spray does what it is advertised to do. It helps to lock in moisture and keep frizz at bay.My hair: I have a mixture of 3b hair that is thick, and slightly coarse in areas. Due to where I live (on the middle of the US East coast), there is no such thing as no humidity. It is always 20% humidity or above. So my hair frizzes very easily.I used this oil with the new leave in conditioner and the supercream, and my curls look decent for about a day. I didn't put gel in them this time, which I had been doing before, to help maintained shape.What I found was that by the end of the day or into the second day, while my curls retained their shape, they were pretty frizzy. Which would then mean they had to be sprayed all over again.So this is where part of the points comes off. Obviously I need to use gel again. But with the amount of oil that I had to use on my hair, for the small bottle, it is too expensive. I would be better off going and getting a different thing of hair oil for less. I will maybe get 6 uses, 7 hopefully, because of how my hair works in where I live (plus thick coarse hair). so when I do use it, it is normally 10-13 sprays going on my hair. Much more than the recommended amount.Positive: it does help me to retain the shine in my hair.It smells goodNot a heavy oilSpray onCon's: priceySmall amount for the price

DevaCurl High Shine Multi-Benefit Oil 1.7 oz,"
So glad I finally found this product! It's really helping add extra moisture and some shine to my dry, low porosity, color treated 2B/C hair. It's light and has a very mild, pleasant scent. Not too heavy to weigh down my waves/curls, but for me it seems to be a big 'missing link' in my curly hair care routine. I use this both on damp hair after the shower, and dry hair to help with 2nd & 3rd day curls. It helps reduce frizz, and I noticed my hair was feeling softer even after the first time I used it. It's a huge benefit for my hair, will absolutely buy this again! 5 big stars.

I believe this is fake or diluted. I am a regular user of this conditioner, but this is my first time buying it on Amazon. It smells normal, but it doesn't feel right. The slip isn't there. I have to use twice as much. My hair does not look good.

I think this is my 1st review ever and I had to write it to warn other potential buyers because I also received a FAKE product!I've been using DevaCurl's One Condition Delight for almost 2 years and decided to purchase this larger bottle on Amazon since it had a great price.Once I received the product, I immediately noticed the smell was not the same and the usual slip wasn't there. I stuck with it thinking it could've been just an impression, however since then, my hair has become freezy, dry and would not curl.I was intrigued and decided to ask for a sample at a local store so I could test it out. Well, it only confirmed my suspicion... the smell and the slip were exactly how I remember them to be, and my hair felt super soft and beautiful afterward. It finally felt like its old self - my curls were back!Avoid the frustration - do not buy from this seller!

I have used the original and the Decadent conditioners by Devacurl. This one works well on my 2A/2B hair type. My hair is thin so it tends to ball on the top of my head in the shower and this conditioner allows me to separate the clumps of knots that it ends up in. The other conditioners did well for this also. I wanted to switch it up and found this was a good change. I have oily skin and wash my hair daily, so the shampoo is good for that. The conditioner smells fresh and has a light citrus aroma to it. I love Devacurls products, so much!

Best thing to happen to my hair in my life. Ism 59 years young my hair is now the curls I always dreamed of, buy the Diva Curl Book watch the DVD . You must use this properly to get great results. When people say your hair is so pretty I say Diva Curl. So many say I tried it, it didn’t work, I tell them they aren’t using it correctly. Once they do they text me thank you so much for teaching me. I use all their products must use all products to get great results

this new lighter line has been a disappointment for my hair.  I have color treated, fine, s-wavy hair and this conditioner doesn't combat the dryness like the ORIGINAL!  The original was never heavy, just thought I would try this for fine hair.  Will not buy again.  Sorry DevaCurl ---  love you no-poo concept and have been freed from all stripping hair care for 2 years now, thanks to you.

I have tried the original, decadent, and delight versions on my daughter's hair. The original gave me headaches. I like the decadent, but thought that I would try the delight since her hair is losing some of its curl as she ages. The smell is devine.  It smells like a quality perfume putting it on, but the fragrance is mild once the hair is dry. It leaves her hair soft with lots of bounce.  It also has great slip.I also use Kinky Curly Knott Today for detangling.  I have found nothing better for that purpose.

My hair absolutely loves this product. I've tried 5 different shampoos and conditioners in the past year, and after watching several youtube videos decided to give this one a shot. I have between 1c and 2c hair strands on my hair, the majority of which are 2a and 2b. Using this and brushing a bit less, along with using the b-leave in conditioner and the wave maker have made for really beautiful waves and curls in my hair.

I used to love DC products - but this latest order - after only using it for about a month, I experienced significantly MORE hair loss, itchy scalp and breakouts on my scalp, back, neck.  Used as ""directed"" along with the other products in the line and nothing else changed - except for the fact that I bought new bottles of product.  I will no longer be using ANY DC products or recommending them to anyone.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
This made all the difference in my 2c hair.  The waves aren't getting that dredlock look anymore and are bouncy once again. Don't live the smell as much as original one condition but it definitely isn't offensive.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I trust DevaCurl because their products are high quality and never fail in giving me beautiful curls . I have 2C hair and I feel like this isn't too heavy at all. It's just enough moisture. I do wish the scent wasn't as strong. It's very very strong. To me it smells a bit lemony citrus which gives me a headache so I have a bit of bias. I really do love it though. I wish they had a non-scented option! I will use the whole bottle but probably won't repurchase because of the scent :/
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I believe this is fake or diluted. I am a regular user of this conditioner, but this is my first time buying it on Amazon. It smells normal, but it doesn't feel right. The slip isn't there. I have to use twice as much. My hair does not look good.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I think this is my 1st review ever and I had to write it to warn other potential buyers because I also received a FAKE product!I've been using DevaCurl's One Condition Delight for almost 2 years and decided to purchase this larger bottle on Amazon since it had a great price.Once I received the product, I immediately noticed the smell was not the same and the usual slip wasn't there. I stuck with it thinking it could've been just an impression, however since then, my hair has become freezy, dry and would not curl.I was intrigued and decided to ask for a sample at a local store so I could test it out. Well, it only confirmed my suspicion... the smell and the slip were exactly how I remember them to be, and my hair felt super soft and beautiful afterward. It finally felt like its old self - my curls were back!Avoid the frustration - do not buy from this seller!

My hair has never looked better since I started using DevaCurl products. This conditioner is super creamy and my dry hair sucks it up. My curls are smooth, less frizzy, and super bouncy. I have long hair but the bottle still lasts for a good amount of time. The pump is nice too so there's more control over how much comes out of the bottle. I'm super happy with this product and will continue to buy.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Love everything DevaCurl! This is a newer scent I enjoy immensely.  It seems expensive but you use a small amount possibility twice a week. Meaning the cost per use is minimal. If you haven't discovered DevaCurl check out the website and purchase products on Amazon. Its not just for curly hair, they have products to enhance every type of hair from wavy to African American .
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Makes a huge difference to use this product on my wavy hair. My hair looks Amazing!
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Deva curl rarely disappoints. I use this in the shower after shampooing as well as after I get out of the shower. I towel dry my hair a ta, run this through my ends then roots and use this as my main and often only hair product. Works great!
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I got this after being impressed with the lo-poo shampoo. This conditioner is pretty pricy if you use a lot at a time like I do (I have hair that falls just below my shoulders). I switched to Treseme Botanicals and it works just as well for a much lower price tag.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
This shampoo and conditioner made my hair break and become thin. After six months of not using it my hair is finally getting back to normal
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Love this product! But when I received it the cap wasn’t screwed on all the way causing the conditioner to leak all over the bag. Box was not damaged.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
did not feel good in my hair at all
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
The product works really well, but the scent is terrible.  It has a sweet artificial smell that literally makes me feel nauseous.  I wanted so much to like it.  I had tried it at a friends house and remembered it smelling really great.  Perhaps they changed the formula.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Great conditioner, the only one I use. Doesn't cause any irritation on my scalp and hydrates my hair.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I took off a star for packing. I love the product, and I will keep buying it. I didn't have any trouble with leakage like others, but my cap was also loose. My issue with packing is this is the second time the top was broke. This makes it hard to use.  Please put some styrofoam around the top and make sure the lid is tight.
"

"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I’ve used this for years. Used to buy at Ulta, significantly less expensive from Amazon. I have very curly hair, and this is one of the few products that helps get a comb through is and tame the frizzies.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Love this product, great for detangling fine hair and does not weigh hair down
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
With Devacurl products, you really need to shop for your hair type. This product is intended for wavy hair, like it says. I have baby fine type 2 hair and I found this to be hydrating and defining for my waves. With this and the shampoo from the same line (low poo delight), I don't need additional products after I shower.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Love it
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
For me this was pretty blah. It smells WONDERFUL but somewhat lacklustre otherwise. I use it scrunched in dry or damp hair as a leave in conditioner and finds that works best.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
The product itself is wonderful, but it arrived open. The connection between the pump and the bottle was unscrewed and the cream had spilled out all over the bag. I lost about a quarter of the bottle because of the fact that it was open during transport. Not pleased.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
This product is FAKE!!! I am so disappointed! It does NOT smell like DevaCurl One Conditioner not does it feel like it. It feels like lotion. My hair is dry and damaged after using this fake product.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
One of the best brand for curly/ wavy girls. No lie. It just feel like your curls is REVIVE AFTER being dead. You need your hands on this if you want your hair to be curly forever.Downside? The price.... but it is worth it.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Product itself was what I ordered but the bottle wasn't full. I'm not sure if they topped off another bottle or someone used some or what but it was almost like 1/4 of the bottle was already gone.

I was hoping that it would be similar to the regular one condition-- just lighter-- but the scent is quite unpleasant which has made it a waste. I regret buying it.

"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I've used Deva products before, but I was beyond PUMPED to see they had released a wavy hair line. I float between 2B/2C hair, and sometimes it's closer to an A (which is annoying), but this conditioner isn't too heavy for my textured, yet fine hair. It doesn't weigh it down the way some conditioners do, but it moisturizes nicely. I leave a little bit of it in when rinsing to fight frizz, but it leaves my hair so soft and happy that it almost isn't necessary (especially when you use the coconut curl super cream). I am definitely buying again!!
"

!!!!? What
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Was better when I used it few years ago. Probably have to switch to something else
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Pros: Worked well with defining my curls and easy to run my fingers through hair while applying it in the shower.Cons: Overpowering scent & caused my sensitive skin to break out along my forehead, jawline, chin, etc. of where my hair came into contact with. I got a headache every time I used this.Unfortunately, I cannot continue to use this product and it's past the window for a refund. I hope DevaCurl will make this without fragrance someday.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I love the Deva curl line. Most of the products work great for my 2b hair. I'm so glad they came out with a lighter weight conditioner. The only thing to keep in mind, at least for me, is that their products take longer to rinse out.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
It's not just the label that has changed, this is a new formula.  I've been using DevaCurl products for years and I've always loved the smell, especially of the conditioner.  While I don't find it offensive in this version like some others do, I prefer the previous scent.  Other than that, it seems to perform similarly to the old formula.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Great product for wavy hair! Fast easy transaction!!
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
This is good for naturally wavy to curly hair.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
The conditioner seems to work okay on my hair, but it smelled SO SO SO bad. It's okay about 1 second and then the undertones of vomit hit.  I have to hold my breath to use it, but I paid a lot of money for this product so I'm going to force myself to get through the bottle. I haven't liked the smell of the newest DevaCurl products, but this one was the worst.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
This stuff is terrible. It leaves my hair frizzy and burns my scalp. I was looking for something more cleansing then the No Poo but this is not it.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER:I got this product as part of the Wavy Mini Transformation Kit.  It includes the Low-Poo Delight, One Condition Delight, and Wave Maker, a styling mousse-cream.  I'm happy I had the opportunity to try out mini sizes of all three for only $12, because although I really wanted to love these products, I was largely dissatisfied.  (Also because it seems like some Amazon sellers sell knockoffs, and I know I got the real thing at an Ulta store, even if I didn't quite like it.)I have low porosity, fine, 2a/b/c hair, and a straight bottom layer.  I have oily roots, having to wash my hair every 2 days (stretch it to 3 once a week with a scalp cleanser), but the ends can get pretty dry once it's time for me to wash again.  While I used to always use a sulfate shampoo, I now use one only once weekly.  I do not include silicones in my hair routine, except for the occasional hair serum.  Therefore, I was pleased that the shampoo, conditioner, and styling product were sulfate- and silicone-free.SHAMPOO:When DevaCurl says ""Low-Poo"", they really mean it.  Because the Low-Poo Delight lathered so little, I felt like it was difficult to spread onto my scalp and that I had to use so much of it, not exactly what I want to do with the most expensive hair product brand I've ever purchased.  I have a cheap little shampoo brush from Sally's that I use for every wash.  Without that thing, there's no way this shampoo would clean my hair nearly enough.  In fact, I washed my hair with Johnson's Baby Shampoo once a few months ago, and it had the same issue with almost no lather, just for comparison.  Both have a fresh scent, but the DevaCurl Low-Poo Delight has a water lily scent, noticeably different from the Johnson's.The interesting thing about this shampoo is that when I wash with it, it makes my hair feel like the water is being all sealed in, the same way my hair feels when I use an oil-based deep conditioner such as the ORS Olive Oil Replenishing Pak.  I may like this for a conditioner, but not quite for a shampoo, considering that I have oily roots.  (While I don't like for my roots/scalp to be dry, which rarely happens anyway, too much moisture there makes it get oily faster.)As for how my hair looks after using both the shampoo and conditioner, I've tried them multiple times, in different weather conditions, and my hair has never come out looking as good as it does with my other shampoos and conditioners, even though my post-wash routine is generally the same.  The very first time using them both, I styled my hair with the Wave Maker, and while my hair looked amazing for a few hours after washing, for the next two days, the waves/curls were looser than usual, and I suppose it was the glycerin that caused it to frizz up a bit.  Other times I have used them, with the Wave Maker or other stylers, I've gotten frizzy hair and/or limp waves.  I do not use these products when I want my hair to look good, which is quite unfortunate considering DevaCurl's great reputation...and price tag.If I wanted a shampoo that hardly lathered that I had to use a ton of to properly cleanse my scalp, and left my waves looking anemic, I might as well buy Johnson's Baby Shampoo for a third of the cost per ounce.CONDITIONER:I did not find a single thing about this conditioner that stood out to me.  It had a nice, fresh, water lily scent.  The consistency was not too runny and not all that thick, but slip is more important to me than how thin or thick the product is, and the slip was not as good as that of other conditioners I've used, even cheap ones like Suave.  There are some conditioners that are so good that I don't even need to use a leave-in afterwards, but I for sure need one after using the One Condition Delight.I find it odd that the shampoo in this line holds in so much moisture from the water in my hair, whereas it's usually conditioner that I would think should do that.  I did not particularly feel that this conditioner was holding in any water or moisture.  However, the combination of the shampoo and conditioner, unfortunately, made my waves/curls looser than usual at best, and frizzy or limp at worst.  I'm wondering if all the glycerin could be the problem.No other shampoo or conditioner I have gives me the problems that these two Delight ones give me.  Sadly, they were not a ""delight"" for me.  In fact, while this brand has a great reputation, I find that I can't wait to use another shampoo and conditioner once it's time for my next wash.I may try the No-Poo Original and One Condition Original.  I'm a little worried that a no-poo may make my scalp oily, but I would think that the conditioner would at least be better for my ends.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I bought this since my hair is wavy rather than curly and it was suggested so as not to weigh down my hair. However, the more I used this, the more my hair felt like straw. The ends look dry and when I comb through my hair it always gets stuck. I think I am going to try the Original or Decadence.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I have fine and super curly hair. Normally anything slightly heavy or ""moisturizing"" weighs my hair down so much and makes it oily. This allows my curls go spring up and be what they need to be....no gel or any other product. Picture is literally after sleeping on it with no satin pillowcase, no pineappling, nothing. Just a little conditioner added in.The packaging was a little defunked. It leaked in the box about the size of a silver dollar. The top was lose and not enough padding.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
This conditioner is okay, but not the holy grail it is made out to be for my hair.My hair is wavy, and I wanted to try something specifically geared for that. I started using this with another brand of shampoo that I had, as my conditioner ran out first. This conditioner didn't condition my hair as well as my previous conditioner (Acure Organics brand). It didn't moisturize as well and left it more difficult to brush through afterwards. I had to rub Argan oil into it just to make it feel more moisturized and allow for better combing. If a conditioner leaves me needing to add a bunch of other products in to actually moisturize or condition and make it manageable, then the conditioner has failed the grade.Once I started using the matching DevaCurl shampoo with it, the state of my hair deteriorated even more. Between the two, my hair is certainly weightless, but by that I mean that it is a poofy fluff mess, akin to having sheep's wool roving on my head. It is hard to comb or brush through, and I hate the way it looks. The shampoo was a smaller bottle, thankfully, but it will be going into the trash can, as much as is hurts to bin $17 of haircare product. As for the conditioner, I haven't decided if I'll keep using it, or if I may try it on my toddler son, whose hair is so short that ultimately it doesn't matter as much if it doesn't work as well.I am going back to Acure, where the prices are better, the products are also free of sulfates and other undesirable chemicals, and where my hair feels and looks nicer.

My hair hated this. I have 2b-3a curls and this left my hair frizzy, matted sticky and weirdly stiff. My hair is highly porous, finely distributed and individual strands are medium to fine. I even tried skipping this as a conditioner/leave in, and used just 1 pump to about six ounces of water in a spray bottle as a refresh, but I got the same abysmal results, wrecking what would have been great second day . It’s possible this didn’t work due to protein overload when added to my other product lineup (suave naturals coconut and eco argan oil) and the scent was strong but not terrible, but at the end of the day this costs too much to be completely unusable for my hair. It will be returned.In replacing this though, I think I may have found a winning routine for my hair - and I’m sharing this for any curlies like me. Cowash with suave naturals, rake in an actual dime size amount of Cantu curl activator cream (which I tried for the first time with this product bombed) and then shake and rake in gobs and gobs of eco argan gel. T-shirt plop and diffuse. I had the best hair day of my life, and as a major bonus the product were affordable.Good luck fellow curlies! Figuring out our hair costs dollars and days, but it feels so empowering and beautifying to find what works and know that no one else has a head of hair just like ours!

I'm actually pretty impressed with this conditioner. I was expecting not to like it because most lightweight conditioners aren't nearly enough for me. I've actually tried numerous times to find a lighter conditioner because the heavy ones weigh my hair down so much I have straight hair and my natural waves can't come through, but it never works and I always end up with just frizz and tangles, but this time I'm happy I finally found one! I haven't tried this with the Deva shampoo yet, but my normal shampoo is sulfate free. Will definitely keep using this product and hopefully the low poo shampoo will add even more oomf to my waves but so far I'm happy with the bounce I got back and my hair is soft and smooth! I will say it's a little pricey and the scent that is in all the Deva products is very strong. It smells exactly like this trashy Paris Hilton glitter body spray/perfume I used to use as a teenager so I like it for the nostalgia but it's definitely not what I would have liked. I wish they would switch to natural essential oils or offer a no fragrance option like Jessiecurl does.

I wish I had found this stuff sooner in life!  I have fine, thin, medium length hair that has some natural wave when I air dry, but can easily be blown out straight as well.  My hair is extremely prone to build up and looking weighted down and flat.  So much so, that I normally do not use a conditioner at all until the winter months when static makes it necessary.This DevaCurl One Condition Delight is truly weightless, and I have tried every conditioner that makes that weightless claim - but this is the only one that actually lives up to it!  My hair is so soft, shiny, full of body, with absolutely zero weight down or build up.  I won't ever be without it.I love that it is silicone free.  I can easily go 2-3 days without washing and my hair still looks freshly washed, which is really saying something for my ""prone to buildup hair"".  With any other conditioner, washing every single day is a must for me.Also, this conditioner is made for wavy hair, which I do have, and it works great when I air dry and leave my hair wavy.  But I use this when I blow my hair out straight also, and it works just as amazing for straight hair!  So straight, wavy, or curly my hair loves this stuff!

I have bought Devacurl products from amazon and directly from deva curl and never had any problems with them. THey all seemed to look, smell, and work the same. However, I bought this Devacurl product on amazon (after buying it several times directly from devacurl) and it burned my scalp. It burned badly and a few days later, all the skin peeled off my scalp. My doctor said it looked like a chemical burn or severe contact dermatitis and to not use it again.  I just received a new bottle that I bought directly from DevaCurl and used it last night with no problem at all. THere is definitely something wrong with this product. It may be fake or have something added to it, I don't know. I definitely won't use it again.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
If you're looking for a new conditioner, and you've got frizz-prone, wavy hair, this is going to be your new bestie.  Leave it on for 5 minutes while you finish your shower, rinse in cold water, gently squeeze out extra water, put in some devacurl light gel, scrunch, and don't touch your hair until it's dry. You will love the difference.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
This conditioner is very lightweight and does moisturize pretty well for not being a heavy conditioner. The scent is something between a reeking chemical jasmine smell and a nice jasmine scent. Odd, I know, but that's the best way I can describe it. So would I purchase it again? Yes - except...apparently I am allergic to the conditioner. Every time I use it my scalp itches for a full day afterward. I have a healthy scalp; I've never had an allergy to a hair product before. But I won't be re-purchasing DevaCurl One because I don't like to have a miserably itchy scalp.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I love this with the entire DevaCurl Delight line. It is light and moisturizing and I have less build-up with it which means I use my clarifying cleanser less. When I want extra moisture I will use my Coconut Asiam cowash in between washes, which is affordable and available to purchase at most drug stores. I will repurchase again and the investment for a 32oz bottle was worth it. However, purchase it through Amazon for cheaper options rather than at the local high end beauty stores as they are more expensive. Here you can get the same product for a fraction of the price.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
I won't say this isn't the real thing made by Deva, but I will say it is the worst thing so far that I have purchased from them. To make matters worse, I took it on a three-week trip without trying it first. Big mistake and won't do that again. For me, this is a terrible product: my hair was dry feeling, had no shine. Ick. I do NOT recommend this product.
"
DevaCurl One Condition Delight Conditioner; 32oz,"
Very unhappy with this product. I liked devacurls other products, and assumed that since I have wavy hair that I could trust that this would work for my hair. Instead of moisturizing, it just sits on top of my hair and makes it gunky. I’ve tried warm water, cold water, different amounts of conditioner and all have horrible results where my hair is a frizzy mess, or lifeless and greasy looking.

This conditioner is a lighter weight than the Deva Decadence conditioner.  I think it's perfect for summer.  Not heavy or sticky.  I'll go back to Decadence in the winter when the air is more dry.  Smells great, too.

I have been using this conditioner for a while now and this is definitely the best price I've seen it listed for. I have wavy hair that is very oily so this formula works great for me. It makes my hair voluminous without drying it out and helps to control my oil so I don't have to shampoo as often.

I have fine, wavy/loose curly hair. I have tried the Original, Decadence, and now DeLight Deva conditioners and this one is surely the most weightless on my hair. It gave my curls more bounce and no greasy feel. Some other reviews complain about the smell, which I was hesitant about, but the conditioner doesn't have a fragrance; it just smells like soap, which is fine by me as I am not a fan of added fragrance in my products.

I was really excited about using this product since I discovered that most curl salons use this in their “bounceback” treatments. I don’t use heat or pull my hair back but I have an autoimmune issue that causes my hair to fall out and this wildly disrupts my curl pattern so I was hoping that this would help that. While it did hydrate and yield bouncy curls, I am concerned about two things: 1) It has a HORRIBLE, overly perfumated smell that is incredibly overpowering. It smells like none of the other DevaCurl items and even after I applied my styling products it continued to overpower them. 2) The product is white. I was expecting it to be a green color because it’s made with seaweed. It leads me to believe that the seaweed was bleached or they chemically removed the color. After speaking with marine biologists, this process actually removes any efficacy of the seaweed. So it makes me wonder: WHY would they bleach it out, and WHAT actually is providing the “deep sea repair.” It makes me wonder if the strong overly perfumated scent is hiding the strong bleach odor from bleaching out the green seaweed color, and thus that is why it’s so strong. Because the item was$54, I’ll use the rest of the bottle but I don’t think I’ll purchase again...

I was sceptical. I have colored curly hair (type 2c/3a), with some serious damage at the ends. No matter what I tried, I just couldn't get my hair ends to be hydrated, and it was always frizzy and tangled. I tried oil treatments at home, other deep conditioning treatments and nothing worked.I tried this treatment once, and kept it on just a little longer than I'm supposed to (about 1 hour), and my dry ends are FINALLY feeling hydrated! It's not completely healthy yet, but the change I saw after just one use has got me so excited! My hair isn't as tangled as it used to get too (which means less breakage!). Very very happy!

I wish I would have known about diva curl when I was younger. This mask (in combination with several other products of same brand) gave me incredibly defined curls. Thank you so much. I let it sit on my hair about 15 mins. FYI, I also used Set it Free on wet hair. Then i combined B'leave-in and Supercream, then scrunched it in. After that I blew dry with a diffuser I always use. Curly girls, you need a blowdryer with a cool shot. The cool air helps to close the cuticle. Now, I won't wash my hair for 3-4 days.

I have 2b-2c wavy hair that's color treated & after a visit to a salon damaged my curl pattern aggressively, I started researching the whole protein thing to help bring my hair back to life.  I used a clarifying shampoo first, then put this on my head & left it for a few hours in a shower cap. After rinsing out, even the first time, I could see the improvement. I'm slowing getting my locks back to life & following the Curly Girl method pretty religiously. Maybe one day I'll aspire to be a CG IG model, but today is not that day.  Either way, I'm very happy with the progession that my hair has made while using this product & I'll continue to use it. For context, I use quite a few of the DevaCurl products & have been overall very happy with them.

Nothing special whatsoever.....Shea moisture protein masks are a lot more conditioning and strengthening than this i recommend those n they are way cheaper (coupons available etc) compared to this. Those I can use alone and get moisturizing benefits as well but this isn't hydrating enough for my curls n I have to mix it with others so yeah not worth it at all

I use this whenever I feel like my hair is getting too dry or sad-- I slather my hair with it, put my hair in a shower cap, and sit in the tub for 45 min before I wash it out in a normal shower.  It leaves my hair feeling stronger and happier, though sometimes it's a bit difficult to figure out if I've managed to wash it all out because it does make my hair feel more slippery, if that makes sense.  Works great for my curls and would highly recommend.

I bought it for repairing my bleach damaged curls- they wouldn’t curl like they used to and moisture wasn’t an issue- protein was- after using this once for 30 minutes, I already see a dramatic improvement in my hair and curls 😍 can’t wait to see what it will be after a few uses!

I thought this product was going to be more moisturizing. It is a good mask to use every other week but not the best one if you have dry hair.

"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
I have several DevaCurl products that I love, but this one is awful for my hair. I've used it three times and I get the same results. It leaves my hair very dry and frizzy. It also makes my curls limp and droopy. Many people seem to love it, but it's the worst conditioner I've ever used. I'm very disappointed in this product.
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
It is just perfect!
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
Really like this condition and found a great price on Amazon.  At least $10 less than other places.  I've been wanting to add a sea protein type product to arsenal.  Its a great deep conditioner supplying just the right amounts of protein and moisture to my naturally curly hair.  My hair is dry but not processed or colored (I use henna to color).  I do a deep treatment twice a month and use to use Ouidad 12 minute reconstructor but its very expensive.  I would say this is comparable to that but much much cheaper. Smells okay nothing fancy but it definitely has an odor and I smell it after I've washed it out but not real strong and not at all once dry.
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
Love how my hair looks and feels after using this!  Much cheaper on here than other retailers!
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
Not sure if I've used it enough to notice a difference in my hair, but DevaCurl has the best products so I'll continue to use until it runs out.

I did not purchase my products from Amazon, I purchased from an authorized retailer, but they aren’t posting my review so I am posting here too. DO NOT buy devacurl products! I have lost probably 1/3 at least of my hair from these products, my hair is damaged, it hardly curls anymore, my scalp was itchy/burning and I had a major dandruff problem while using these products. A simple google search will show you the controversy going on currently with devacurl. Don’t waste your money and don’t risk this happening to you! I believe at one time their products were good and that’s why the reviews are mostly good, but something has changed with their products and they aren’t what they used to be. Their reviews should reflect these changes. There is a current class action lawsuit forming against them for the damage they’ve caused to at least tens of thousands of people. Probably more. Don’t risk it happening to you too!
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
It looked like already used. Did not work like the original product I’ve bought before from a store.
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
So far, i like it. I used this and the matcha butter mask together. I just did the same amount of both finger-combed it through my hair and then rinsed out completely. My curls looked more defined and so far I am pleased with the product. I exclusively use DevaCurl products. I use the No Poo, One Condition, B'Leavin, Ultra Hold Gel. And on occasion, when my hair needs it i use the Micellar Cleansing thingy, and now I will be using the Deep Sea Repair and Matcha Butter Conditioning Mask on a regular basis but as needed. I also use the hairspray occasionally and I use the No Poo dry shampoo cleanser.

After one long treatment (1 hr, with the bowl method), I could not believe my hair was so curly. I thought I was a mixed 2B-3A, but I am now a solid 3B with 3C curls underneath. The top layer of my hair still needs more moisture conditioning masks, and Olaplex 3 treatments but I believe this is the curl pattern I was born with. My curls are shinier and smoother with less tangling. Of course, I still need styling product and use curly girl drying methods. I had already been using Deva cowash and conditioner for about 3 months by the time I tried this mask (previously was using Biolage cowash for curls). I have since used the mask 2 more times for 30 min.However, I noticed my hair was thinning after 6 months on Deva wash, and after 3 treatments of Deep Sea. I went to the dermo, had bloodwork and scalp biopsies, and she believes it is my Deva products based on the ingredients, so I have discontinued them and we are monitoring. In googling, there are many concerns similar to mine. But also many people who are doing really well with Deva products. The results can not be denied and I am very disappointed to give up this hair mask and cowash system, but that doesn't mean hair loss is true for everyone and if I had to do it over again, I would still try this, but just be more mindful in monitoring my hair density.  I still recommend this mask to someone who wants to get moisture, shape and shine back into their hair.I'm 50yrs old, with a few previous health issues that have affected the condition of my hair, but I'm on the other side of it in the last year. My dermatologist remarked that my hair and scalp are very healthy, aside from the thinning. I have been using Biotin 10k mg once a day for 4 years.

My hairdresser gave me a sample of this after giving me a balayage and I absolutely LOVED IT. The sample size (maybe 1oz?) lasted me over 4 months. I have generally straight, maybe slightly wavy hair but this actually gives me curls which I wasn’t even expecting. It repairs my bleached and damaged hair AND gives me curls?? Yeah, that’s why I bought the 8oz bottle on amazon.

"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
I’m new to letting my curls curl. Needed conditioning and moisture. This has worked great
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
I used it for my frizzy hair.  Not helpful
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
This product dried my hair out and made it feel like seaweed. For days after I first used it my hair was crispy and felt like it had a weird residue on it. I wouldn’t recommend this product. I have used Heaven In Hair for a long time and was looking for a change but I went back to the other Deva products and threw this stuff out.
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
Moisturized and defined my curls. The product has to be left in hair for 20 minutes, so it is a bit of a process. I'll probably use it twice a month instead of the recommended once each week.
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
I don't see much of a difference in my very fine wavy colored damaged hair. Actually the first time I did a mask how it is suggested at the package, I felt my hair being dry. Use it sometimes now as a conditioner now.
"
"DevaCurl Deep Sea Strengthening Mask, 8oz","
So far so good! I am using this in conjunction with the other deep conditioning mask. It has made a noticeable difference to my low porosity, frizzy and fine, caucasian curly hair. Especially with high humidity during summer in FL.

I have super curly long dry thick hair, and this is a wonder product for me.  I can tell immediately after use by the softer texture of my hair that it has been moisturized and smoothed by this product.

My hair does not do well with the Deva Curl conditioners apparently. I order three different ones including this one.  It leaves my hair 3B feeling like dry straw. I actually had to use another conditioner to undo the hard feeling of the hair in the shower. Will not buy again.  Love the other products.

This smelled fresh and was sleek going on. But it didn't leave my hair feeling any more conditioned than my normal leave-in conditioner. I have medium curly hair (3B and 3C).

This product is great. I am a deep conditioning girl-- do it all the time for my color- treated hair-- which means I need a deep, deep, deep conditioner which this is. I have always been a devacurl girl so there was no convincing when I learned they developed a new conditioner in addition to their heaven in hair. I love this for wash and go, hair was so soft with no residue, can't wait to give it a go again. Plus, the smell is heavenly.

"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
This towel is hilarious. Man, I tell ya. Curly hair methods just aren't designed for gals with long hair. This towel is the ""bigger size"" and it looks like the size of a hand towel. My hair is down to my lower back. I have very thick 3B hair. And if I had bangs, maybe those would fit in this towel. But the rest of my hair...Ha! I can hear my follicles mocking me for spending $20 on this oversized wash rag. If your hair is long, ladies...save your Jacksons and go through the thrift store bins and find ya a good oversized t-shirt for $1.25. Works like a dream.

"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
This is a great towel. I got it and used it the same day. It's great for the plopping method. It did cut the frizz in my hair took about a hour to dry (so if you're looking for a quick dry this isn't it) ONLY issue I had with the towel was the loop it broke and unraveled in a instant leaving me to use the ribbon tied around it in the box as a new loop (cut it doubled it and sewed it on). Overall I think the towel is good just needs a stronger loop.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
I absolutely love this towel. I have curly hair that sops up water. It was taking all day to dry and if I used my aquis towel I could cut it down to 10-12 hours. I tried blow drying and it was laughable. UNTIL this towel. It’s amazing and after using my hair took 2 hours to air dry and when I decided to blow dry instead of air dry it only took 20 minutes! And I finally got a cast from my hair products! Thank you for saving my curly hair.

My hair is naturally curly long and very thick. Takes forever to dry. This towel definitely cuts drying time but didn't alleviate frizz or define curls. Wish the towel was longer.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
On my curly hair journey I have found that I like flour sack towels cause less frizz than microfiber so I'm a little sorry I bought this.  But It's still a nice large towel to drape on my shoulders and if frizz is not an issue for you it's big enough to plop your hair in which is a plus.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
So much better than the original version. I’ve had the original white one for several years and now keep it in my travel bag so I can use this thicker and larger one at home regularly. This new gray one is large enough to plop or wrap my hair after washing it and really shortens the amount of time I have to expose it to the heat of the diffuser because it pulls so much more water out. Love it.

I love this towel. I have waist length, wavy hair that frizzes easily. This towel eliminates frizz and helps keep my waves defined. The absorbency of the towel cuts down drying time significantly.

It’s a great feel and dries the hair. But why can’t it be as long as it is wide? Or vice versa (however you look at it) it’s a weird rectangle, that would make a better square.

This towel is great for my curly hair. I have an American Wave and this helps the curl form whole drying without adding frizz.

This towel absorbs the excess water in your hair, keeps your curls on lock, and prevents frizz.  My curls never looked better!

Love my Deva Curl microfiber towel!! It’s so soft. And big enough to wrap around and secure on my head
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Amazing product for drying curly hair! Really absorbs water without the frizz :)
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Love this towel! I use it often - at least 2 to 3 times a week along with the devacurl shampoo and conditioner.  It dries my hair quickly and I no longer have frizzy curls...highly recommend for mixed hair types!!

Towel works great, but the loop broke after two uses and now the stitching on the side is breaking apart
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
The fabric and quality of the towel are great, but it is much too small to wrap around your head!...so, what to do with it?
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Too small - couldn't wrap it around my head :(
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
The size of a napkin - can't even wrap it around your head - total waste of money
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
This “new” towel is no different than the older version. The size is the same, the smell (even after washing and hang drying is the same, and the ribbon hanging loop always breaks off.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Not quite big enough for my preference, but still a decent product.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Best towel ever for your hair.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
I received a towel as a gift and I liked it so much I ordered another one! I highly recommend this towel if you have hair that is prone to being frizzy.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Very soft and perfect size it can fit all of your “thick” hair in it.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Just an ordinary towel

If you expect to sell this, you can't charge $83. They aren't worth more than $20 and everybody is aware of that.

"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
I recently embraced the DivaCurl brand. My hair has been getting curlier and curlier for the last decade, and I struggle with keeping the frizz down to a minimum. This towel is large enough to dry my hair by scrunching or by wrapping my wet curls, and does a great job of keeping the frizz down. It's lightweight, so I can wear it while I get ready, and it dries quickly, even in high humidity weather.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
I like this better than the previous Deva towel because it's large enough to wrap around my head. But I'm not a fan of the color grey.  If there were different color options I would give it five stars
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
It's small but the perfect size for using on your hair. The only problem is that it makes my hair frizz just as much as using a regular bath towel. I only use it to drape over my shoulders while I'm applying product or letting my hair air dry if I need to protect what I'm wearing.  I would say that scrunching with it a bit does give more definition to my curls, but they frizz so badly afterward that it's not worth it.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
I purchased this for my curly girl method of absorbing water from my hair without creating frizz.  The towel is a great size and very absorbent.  I scrunched out the water and hung it to dry by the convenient attached loop.  I also used it to wrap around my plastic hair cap when I deep conditioned my hair to help create heat.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
The microfiber towel is large enough to do the job of scrunching the water out of my curls. It is larger than the original DC towel, but if it were just 3 -4 inches longer, I could wrap it around my head and let it stay there. I have shoulder length hair that is very thick.  I may just sew on a few inches of regular fabric to the 2 short ends to  help me wrap the towel.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
This towel is great for my wavy hair.  It dries fast, and I'm able to launder it with the other towels.  It is SUPER soft, and seems to have helped calm down the frizz.  Also, it's super compact, so easy to take when traveling.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
My curly hair is in heaven with this towel. It’s a great size and amazing at drying my hair n not making it frizzy an no damage either. Love it! And totally recommend it, not just for curly girls but everyone.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
I've used this every day for 2 months and just love it. It works exactly as it should. Absorbent, easy to hang, eliminates frizz. All good.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
I wish it was a tad longer, even an inch or two with a good way to attach or close it so that it would stay wrapped on my head even just long enough to get my makeup on. I still use it, but it is not convenient and just falls off. I actually just prefer a regular towel.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
I bought this for my daughter’s hair holds water and is so hard to dry. It was amazing how much water it took out of her hair and saved on drying time!
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Just the right size. Really helps my curls stay separated. Put those oversized cotton Ts away. I highly recommend!
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Too small maybe if your bald it’ll work but I got thick long curly hair so this is basically a napkin
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Awesome buy. Definitely a must have.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
The towel works great but I have long hair and this towel is small and won’t cover my whole hair
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
This towel has worked so well to dry my curly hair. My hair has had less frizz than when I used to use a regular towel.
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
To expensive, could have used a lot less expensive and had the same results
"
"DevaCurl Microfiber Anti-Frizz Towel, Gray","
Really helps my curly hair dry and not become frizzy.  A little expensive but worth the price I think.

"DevaCurl Flexible Hold Styling Hairspray, 10oz","
I love Deva curls cream and gels- they’re so unique and curl my hair unlike any other product I’ve ever tried but this hairspray doesn’t seem to be any different than any other hairspray. It was stiffer than I’d thought, but mostly I didn’t like the really earthy chemical scent - hair products should smell good!
"
"DevaCurl Flexible Hold Styling Hairspray, 10oz","
I love that this hairspray doesn't leave your hair feeling crunchy. Yes, there is a bit of stiffness (it's not going to feel like you just did a deep conditioning session), but your curls will still bounce and look gorgeous. This actually helps keep my curls longer throughout hot humid days (living in Houston is quite the trial!).
"

Amazing product! Flexible hold that keeps the bounce in my curls without the buildup. Smells AMAZING!!! Wish I had started using this sooner. I use with the Deva Curl line. Worth the investment!

I love every other DevaCurl product that I've tried, but wasn't a fan of this hairspray. Two stars because it does hold your hair in place with little to no frizz. However, it's not flexible. My hair feels sticky and stiff after using, no matter the amount I use. Defeats the purpose of using the other products for soft bouncy curls.
"
"DevaCurl Flexible Hold Styling Hairspray, 10oz","
This is BY FAR the best hairspray and one of my favorite curly hair products I've ever found.  This give me the BEST BOUNCY curls, shine, and all touchable and never crunchy.  Seriously hands down a staple in my hair routine.
"
"DevaCurl Flexible Hold Styling Hairspray, 10oz","
I love this hairspray because it holds all day but, it's a nice, flexible hold. My hair feels really nice and soft. I can also spray my hair and work it with my fingers a little bit before it dries. I don't have to have it perfect before I spray because the spray allows some work time. I haven't noticed any buildup in my hair either.
"

Amazing!!Not only did my tangles melt but my curls are poppin more than they ever have, with little product needed.I drench my hair in the shower, then part in half and use about a quarter size amount on each side, massage into hair let sit, then rinse.

"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Magical. Not sure how, but it works. I ise on my daughter’s 3C/4A hair. When hair is soaking wet, you apply (I put mostly toward the bottom half)...let it sit for a minute. Doesn’t take much time, but it helps tremendously with combing out tangled and not having screaming matches. (She is 11). The end.

There are some products that are synonymous with their superior quality. I think OPI’s Sêche Vite is one. No other top coat like it. There are products we use the brand name with and we don’t even realize it - see: Scotch tape, Dumpster, etc. Wash Day Wonder is one of these products. In just a couple of years, people will say detangler when they’re speaking in general about Wash Day Wonder. I am not a wash day lady. I should be. I have extremely thick, 4b(?) natural hair. By the time I get around to detangling and washing/conditioning my hair, there’s nothing left to do at the house besides dusting the top of the fridge. I used make up ANY excuse not to do my hair...until now. Detangling used to take me 1.5 to 2 hours. I swear it only takes about 30 minutes with WDW; maybe 45 if I’m moving slowly. Never has a product worked this well in all of my 10 years of having natural hair. Believe me when I tell you, WDW is the only reason I don’t have a relaxer. I’ll buy it by the gallon if I have to.

I love DevaCurl products and this is one of my must haves fro my hair care routine. I have dense, low porosity hair (it takes a long time for the water to absorb), shoulder length, super curly dry hair so it gets tangled very easily. I use this with a WET brush to detangle my hair every time I wash it. It has amazing slip & glide and my hair feels so soft, and smells great after I use it. Its a must have for tangles of every kind!!
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I usually detangle with conditioner, so this is a new way to try to get used to. The product smells good and does help with detangling. It’s best to apply it to drenched curls, then add shampoo before rinsing it out. Then condition as normal. Although it does help smooth and detangle, I’m not sure the extra product and step is worth it. I can detangle just as well with my conditioner.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I purchased this due to all of the good reviews. Mistake. Do not purchase this product if you use hairspray. It felt really weird when I put the product on my hair, then I had all these little white balls everywhere in my hair. I though ""okay, its just getting hairspray out, it will come out after shampoo and conditioner"". When I got my hair out of towel I could not even get a wide tooth comb through it. White balls everywhere. I do not use a lot of hairspray or strong hold hairspray. I had a lot of hair break off trying to get a comb through it and finally had to rewash hair, defeating the purpose of making wash day easier. Save your money and just use conditioner as a pre poo.
"

I LOVE THIS! This detangler work magic in my mixed hair. It cut major time out of my shower and is gentle enough to use everyday. On wash days I detangle, shampoo, condition, moisturize. On other days I detangle, condition, and moisturize. It's great. It is still some work to get the tangles/knots out (it's not literal magic) but it makes the job so much easier. My 30 minutes showers have become 15. It's a bit on the expensive side but we'll worth It!

"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Thank God for this product!  I have THICK, somewhere between type 2B-3A depending on length, cut, and weather. And I So so wish this product had launched a year [+ 7 days to be exact] ago. literally would have deterred me from cutting 14"" off. Also, I now have more time for doing... ANYTHING other than detangling and ripping out chunks of hair in the shower. This product has eliminated the (physical and mental) headache and frustration of the oh so time consuming knots.

This product works wonders. I used this on my mother hair which is like mine - kind of web-like & sister hair which is very thin. It was very easy to prep their hair especially because you leave the product in when you wash your hair. Also, this product left their hair very soft. I will order again.

No more tangles. Smooths your hair with no buildup. Put it in before shampoo and my hair feels so much better. Have been using for over a year and it keeps performing great! I have very fine curly hair that tends to dry out and break a lot. This product keeps my hair soft and manageable and it doesn't break as much.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Not impressed. I saw no noticeable difference. Total waste of money. I would say it almost makes it harder to get through my hair because it seems to dry it out.  I tried to use it occasionally just to use it up but eventually just gave up completely.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I found this to be FAR less effective than using a very rich conditioner to detangle my little girl's fine, very curly hair. It adds an unnecessary extra step, smells masculine (think Axe body spray, ugh) and actually WORSENED tangles. It requires gobs and gobs of product per application. And it has absolutely no conditioing properties on its own - it is supposed to act solely as a sort of ""hair lubricant"". Extremely disappointed. At this price point, shocked by the lack of efficacy.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I am trying to go back to my natural texture instead of getting relaxers every 8 weeks like I used to.  A frustration is how difficult it can be to comb through my long, thick 4c hair when washing.  This has been very helpful with that.

Only purchase if you have tangled hair and going to detangle in the shower because you just wash it out if not. But it works well I gave 3 stars because you can just use conditioner this just has way more slip

I'm a curly girl so this product creates one addittional step. That is the only negative thing that I have time say.  The time spent is with it.  It is a great detangler!

We love wash day wonder! It makes washing so much easier! Make sure your hair is pretty soaked with water before applying and work in small sections.

Very slick feel when applied to dry hair. Instantly moisturizes the hair. My hair never felt better before a wash.

I didn't find this incredibly useful
"

Will not buy half of the product was allready spilling out and it didn't have a seal on the bottle making me suspect it's fake. I have tried the wash day wonder and this one felt water down as if some one is ripping people off on here.

Slip is fantastic. But I just found it to be unnecessary for me. The conditioner I use does just fine and I can leave it in my hair!

LOVE!!! If you have any knots in your hair, or your kids hair, this will knock your socks off!!

This product work great on my 4c hair
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Amazing-I seem to use more of it than I should but I can’t figure out how to evenly distribute it through my hair without using too much.This has tremendously reduced breakage and knots- if it weren’t for the price I’d use this everyday
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Only gave 4 stars because of the price. It does exactly what it says it does.  Truly an amazing product!!! No more nights pulling knots out of my daughter’s hair. Just a little pricey
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I am a huge DevaCurl fan and this product misses the mark for me. They say silky and lightweight but I find it more greasy. It sort of works if I use a lot but I was hoping for something more conditioner-based.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
This stuff is awesome- but don't apply to your scalp or it may make your hair look greasy! This is a serious life saver especially when trying to wash my hair after adding styling products (hairspray, mousse, etc) to it. A little goes a long way!

Favorite detangler for wavy hair. Smells amazing!

Didn’t do much for my hair & I have wavy hair. My hair is fine & prone to frizz & tangles

Definitely gets the tangles out before shampooing.

The “slip” is amazing, but I wasn’t fond of the smell.

This product is great for maintaining your curls. I used this on my daughters hair and she loved it. I highly recommend this!
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
This product is amazing I use it when I take down my extensions and it makes the process so easy. It allows the tangles and knots to seemingly melt away!

"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Product was watered down, noticeably different from bottles purchased in the past.  In the future, I will only purchase from DevaCurl manufacturer, too expensive not to receive legitimate product.

Thank You Jesus ❤

At the beginning felt very slimming but as it went down through my curls it made my hair more tangled than it was at the beginning. So weird.

Not good detangler. Their conditioner Works way better as a detangler.

Did detangle however, could of used more slip.

"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
This is a great detangler!  I purchased for my 9yo daughter, who has 4A hair that is super dry and prone to matting.  This has a very silky texture that makes it easy to detangle her hair with my fingers in about 5-10 minutes.  This is one of the best hair products I've tried for my daughter's hair, and I think I've spent a gazillion bucks and tried everything.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I will be the first to say that this stuff is MAGIC.  Apply it liberally and finger comb and your tangles are GONE!  The product easily rinses out once hair is cleansed.  This stuff is so great that even just CLEANSING makes your hair feel like you've completely conditioned it.  It's expensive, but so worth it.  NOW...I am not so sure I would want to buy from a seller who cannot even get the correct description of the product being shown.  It's NOT a gel as the description says.  Red flag.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Love this for all types of Hair! Including extensions. I’m a hair stylist. With thin fine textured  Straight hair. Tried this to help with knots that take me 15min to detangle after a wash.  Expecting it to weigh down my thin hair. After 4mo of almost daily use I can report  has not weighed down my hair.  I believe it has been responsible for the sudden growth that I’m seeing.  My hair tangles in Knots so bad after every wash that it breaks off on the ends durring the detangling  process.  When I use this I  honestly do not have one knot in my hair.It rinses out clean as you use it with your normal shampoo.  I’ve now started recommending this to all of my Extension Clients and of course curly hair clients.  It’s really a godsend for everyone.  Diva curl  please never stop making this!🙏💕  incorporate a wet brush or wide tooth comb in the shower while using this product and you have perfection.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I purchased this product without looking at video reviews or conducting much research. I regret that decision. I have 4B/4C hair and suspect that this product just isn't ideal for my hair type. It appears that reviewers with looser curl patterns were more likely to obtain the desired result with this product. The product did not have much slip and did not ease the process of dangling my hair. The product just isn't that great and NOT worth the hefty price tag.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
My hair is thick with tiny curls, and after wearing it in a protective style for a few months, I decided to try this for detangling purposes. I didn’t use it in the shower, I just wet my hair with a spray bottle, then used this cream, which worked AMAZINGLY. The comb easily slid through my hair with very little resistance.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
AMAZING!!! I HAVE ALWAYS HAD REALLY BAD KNOTS, AND HTHIS MELTED THEM AWAY, WITH AN EXTREME EASE... NOW I DID USE MORE THAN SOME PEEPS SAY THEN noticed if u add water u don't need so much product. BUT IT WORKS!!!! I saved SO MUCH CONDITIONER! WILL CONTINUE TO BUY! LOVE DEVA CURL

My 12 year old daughter recently has taking a interest in her curly hair. She has researched products that work for her hair type and also those that don’t.In our last trip to NY, she decided to seek a professional to give her a Devacut. The specialist was very knowledgeable and suggested this product. Well she’s hooked! Not just in this product but the whole line. This wash day wonder is pre-shampoo and helps to soft hair and detangle.I tried it once when I was preparing to wash my hair and I can say first hand “WOW”.  There is a difference. So now when I see the price these products I understand that it’s worth it.Just a warning: bottles usually come with some spillage. The good news is that they are wrapped in plastic bags however, no one wants to lose a drop of product.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Detangling after a thorough shampoo and scalp scrub was always an uncomfortable chore and this product makes it quite a bit easier. I have to use a lot of it, which is pricey, but I use it after the shampoo (not before as recommended, since tangling occurs after vigorous shampooing) and combing my hair out before conditioning produces a lot less pulling and shedding. Product then rinses cleanly for good conditioner penetration. I use Kinky Curly Come Clean shampoo and Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus conditioner on wash day and style with Kinky Curly Knot Today, Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel and Deva Curl’s newer clear pomade on my ends for definition that lasts a week but doesn’t leave the feel of build-up.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I love this product. First time, I was unimpressed but when I washed my hair a second time, my hair felt amazing! Will continue using and buying. My hair has never felt this soft.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
This product is MAGICAL!!!!! I really does work to easily detangle as it creates a ton of slip. My hair is 3c/4a and I can easily finger detangle very quickly.  Wow! Didn't believe the hype but it really is worth it
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Probably best for thicker hair. I have normal curly hair it's not wavy it's not corkscrew and this is simply not needed for my hair type. I also feel obligated to state that Amazon is not an official seller of devacurl so this is third party. I haven't had any problems but it's something I didn't know.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
I will never order this product again online from ""NaqshBeauty.""  The product wash open and spilled inside package.  All the individual had to do was tape the nozzle down before mailing product. Unfortunately, the overall rating is a 1 because the product was damaged. However, know this is a wonderful product and should not be purchased through ""NaqshBeauty.""
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
This stuff is great.  I got my very long brown hair bleached and it damaged it to where I could hardly brush it out after washing, it would take an hour.  After applying this to the length prior to shampooing, it made combing my wet hair out so much easier.  Fantastic product for knotty hair!
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Works really well!  Only need a tablespoon to prepare hair for shampoo.  Only need a much smaller amount of shampoo.  Aides in cleaning hair by preping hair to utilize shampoo more efficiently.  I love it.  Wish it were more economical,  i.e., cheaper.  Will buy again.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
This product was delivered on time without any defects. The only problem I have with this product is the price, however if you're concerned with amount of hair fall from matted or extremely dry hair this product is worth every penny. My daughter has very thick coarse kinky coily 4b/4c hair. I recently took down her 3mo old braids and this worked a charm detangling her hair before wash day. Highly recommend for naturals.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
This did nothing that regular conditioner and super wet hair couldn’t. SAVE YOUR COINS!!
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
So far I've tried it twice on my thick, curly, mixed race hair and was disappointed both times.  I will continue to use it since I'm not going to waste money, and combine it with my Herbal Essence to detangle my hair.  I'm a HUGE fan of the DevaCurl Decadence line but this doesn't work for me.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
This is amazing and has really helped with bathtime with my daughter!! It actually loosens tight curls so that you can comb through it and also afterwards the hair looks amazing!
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
It's so much easier to comb my hair now! I don't dread washing my curls anymore!
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Listen! I LOVE this product! It really works WONDERS!! I have VERY thick kinky hair. I don’t know what type of curl exactly, but thicker than a snicker. As soon as I apply this on my hair before I wash it, it detangles my hair and makes it easy to wash and comb through. No other product as detangled my hair as well.
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Just put this on your hair on wash day and use your fingers to get rid of the tangles....works really well
"
"DevaCurl Wash Day Wonder, 12oz","
Smells good but a little strong. This helps with my shampoo day significantly. And it makes finger detangling much easier

Product works well on my daughter's hair.  However, it is very heavily scented.  Different from other Deva products we've used.  Would like a lot better if the scent wasn't so strong.

I have used this shampoo many times before and LOVED it. I decided to purchase the larger sizes from Amazon; however, the shampoo is not at all like the previous bottles I have purchased. The shampoo is the consistency of hair gel, it dispenses in a clumpy, sticky mess. I will not buy this product from Amazon again.

I've been using the low-poo delight shampoo and conditioner for quite some time now. I just ran out of my last bottles and had ordered this, but there is something wrong. The shampoo isn't the right consistency - it's not supposed to be sticky, like gel. It doesn't even lather and the scent is different too. I can't use it - this seems like fake DevaCurl to me. I will be buying my DevaCurl directly from them from now on.

I have used Deva Curl products for 4 years.  I switched to the Delight Low-Poo and One Condition and it is awful.  It makes my hair frizzy, dry and unmanageable.  When I wash my hair the Delight Low-Poo makes my hair feel like I can't even put my fingers through my hair.  I wished I had not bought a big bottle.  I'm not sure if this is what the product is suppose to be or if the company that I bought it from substituted something else in the bottles, but it is the worse. It was sold by salon*expo.  I will never buy again.

FRAUD!  I have used this shampoo for years... with great results.  I purchased the first time from this vendor and the consistency of the shampoo seemed off and sticky.  Color was darker than normal too.... more beige than clear.  I didnt think anything of it... just that they reformulated the product... I bought it a second time from this vendor and the same consistency came thru... and then the unthinkable happened!  my hair started to fall out and break off.  I thought I was dying and went to many doctors and many test later... they found nothing wrong with me physically and was told that i was stressed.  but my hair continued to fall out.  We finally figured out it was this shampoo that was causing the damage!  Had it tested against the actual formula and was told that this was NOT the original formula.I stopped using this and my hair is just starting to grow back but they say it will take years to fully recover.  Stay away from this product.  Be very afraid if you chose to ignore this warning.

I am a Devacurl girl and use these products exclusively and even go to Devacut stylists to get my hair cut. I am positive that this is not real Devacurl, the scent is not right and when I used it it felt different than when I buy it at a salon or Ulta. Buyer beware! We spend thousands of dollars a year on Amazon and this was so disappointing to me!

This is supposed to be awesome for waves. The conditioner was not moisturizing. I was not impressed with the cleansing of the low-poo over the no-poo. My defined waves turned into a single strands of frizz that floated and danced like fine snakes from Medusa's head, but not nearly as cool. Really disappointed that I purchased such a large container for a trial run. However, I can say with certainty that either of these products did not work for my 2B/2C hair except to create a crown of frizz.

I have wavy curly hair, and most “curly” shampoos I’ve found are too heavy for my curls. This is my FAVORITE shampoo and conditioner! It makes my curls soft and healthy and shiny, while also not weighting them down. I pair it with the Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel after I shower, and my curls look great for 1-3 days. Highly recommend these products, especially for folks with wavy curly hair!And these large bottles are great for the shower. It’s worth the investment to not have small bottles that don’t last very long. These larger bottles last me around 4-5 months.

I have wavy and frizzy hair so I was excited to try out devacurl after all of the hype. I was very unimpressed by how an expensive product does virtually nothing to combat my frizz or tame waves.

This has to be altered! It is not the same as I’ve gotten in the past. The scent is different and lathers differenty, couldn’t place it at first then it  hit me! It smells like Joy dish detergent!!!!

I’ve been using this product on my myself and my daughter for a while now. I finally decided to go for the bigger bottles and the shampoo is the consistency of slime or wet glue.

GREAT price! I saved $30, buying from the salon is much more expensive. I don't wear my hair naturally curly that often but I still love this product and use it every day. My hair holds curl better, doesn't get greasy and the product doesn't clog my pores (something I've had a lot of trouble with in the past). It also smells nice and doesn't leave any residue in your shower. I will continue to buy this over and over again!

This product is fantastic. I’ve read some of the negative comments.  One thing you must remember is to remove build up once a month.  Without sulfates, your hair can build up with products.  Deva curl recommends this.  I do and have great success.

I have used this shampoo and conditioner for two years now.  I purchased the big bottles straight from the salon last time.  I worry this has substitutions or fillers added.  The shampoo is a much darker color than previously (I still have a little left), and it doesn't work into my hair.  It is very stringy and globs up in my hair!
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
I didn't realize Deva Curl came out with a new fragrance.  The scent gives me an instant headache.  Please note the yellow top indicates a different smell than the ORIGINAL.  Won't ever buy it again.  The company was fine; I just didn't realize it was a different scent until it was too late to return it.

Buyer beware. This is not authentic devacurl products. If you’ve used them in the past, then you’d know that the  cleanser does not lather as it is not a traditional shampoo. This shampoo is thicker than it should be and lathers like any other shampoo. Spend the extra money to buy authentic products at a salon or ulta!

The shampoo has an inconsistent texture to it - its best described as gummy. I've purchased this several times and it was fine, but this time I believe it should not have passed a quality control check.  The conditioner is just fine - as always

Works awesomely for my wavy hair.My only buyer-be-ware is that the shampoo does not bubble or foam which can take some getting used to.I also feel like I have to wash my hair more often than I would with a bubbling sulfate-free shampoo but, honestly, it is worth it!

Awful. Made my hair feel like straw - even after conditioning could barely get a comb thru it. Also really don't like the scent - smells like bad, cheap cologne. Even if you have naturally wavy hair like me, stick with the original Low Poo for curly hair!!!

THE BEST shampoo and conditioner for wavy hair!
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
This is not an imitation! Sold by amazon from Deva as its noted above. This is the DELIGHT version of their product so it works a little differently and smells different. This is my personal favorite for my hair type. DEVA offers 3 different shampoos for different hair types. Best shampoo for curls I've found and I love their light gel. Leaves my hair feeling soft and natural not crunchy.

These products are just awful. They  have turned my wavy hair into a frizzy and greasy mess. They coat the hair with a slimy residue. The smell is also not very nice. What a waste of money. Disappointed. Going in the trash.
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
The perfect combo for wavy hair!  I started using the no poo about a year ago and then switched to the low poo because my hair is more wavy than curly in most places.  I'm amazed.  My hair is so healthy and shiny. It has so much body and curls up more than it did with the no poo.  I love the smell and feel of my hair.  This is the perfect duo for wavy to curly hair.
"

Please don't buy this product it will cause your hair to fall out and break. I lost 1/3 of my hair during 2 months I was using it.

This is not the same quality as the (same) DevaCurl products I have used in the past.  They smell different and made my hair flat, dry and a completely different experience than I have had in the padt..  I can't help but feel like these are a knock off.  I should have known for the price.
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
I don’t even know why I bought this - I know you’re running the risk of getting something fake off amazon and it def is fake. I’ve been using deva products for over 10 years - this weirdly tacky, off smelling stuff is not it. Luckily deva has a sale every few months and you can get this bundle plus 12 extra ounces of conditioner for $4 more - and you know it’s the real stuff. If you’re reading this, trust me, spend the $4, it’s well worth it!
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
The ladies of the house really like both products. Me.. I’m bald so I will never feel the luxurious mane that these products will produce. This is a low foaming product so don’t over do and think you need more because it doesn’t foam up, like somebody in my house that blew though both bottles in under two weeks because “I just kept adding more to get it to foam!”. I might as well as lit $80 bucks on fire. I digress. It works very well on curly hair.
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
As previous reviewers have stated there is something off with the shampoo and conditioner that comes from this seller. The shampoo is sticky to the point it is hard to even work into your hair and hard to rinse out. The conditioner does not work correctly either. It appears to be fake which, if you go to devacurl's website they have a blog post about this being a problem. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. I suggest buying from another seller.
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
I had been using the No-Poo for about a year, and my stylist recommended I switch to the Low-Poo.  I only wash my hair about 2 times a week, so it lasts forever. It smells amazing, and I compared the ingredients to the bottle from Ulta and it matches. Great price!
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
The product is awesome! Leaves my 2c/3a/3b hair soft and shiny and doesn't weigh down my very fine strands. I took off one star because the lid of the shampoo wasn't tight and had leaked inside the package.

My daughter absolutely loves this product.  We have to order it again :)  It's all she uses and it works well on her hair.  It smells terrific and her hair is more manageable than ever.  Great product.  I read other reviews where the product was watered down...this was not the case for us.
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
This low poo seems watered down. It runs right off my hand and is lacking fragrance. Makes me wonder if this is not the real thing. To be clear, I have been using these products for a while so I know what yo be expect and this isn't it.
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
Perfect for my Low Po 3A hair! I needed less moisture and more protein and this line was amazing.The low-poo is less than desireable in scent but it does an incredible job! No harsh sulfates in it at all, lathers nicely.The conditioner is AMAZING!! It smells so good, like a lemony-sandalwood but not overpowering.I was surprised to see the amount of protein in both products and will continue using them in my routine.
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
For my 3b-type hair, I think I'll stick with DevaCurl's No Poo & One Condition. Overall, this delight version is great, leaves my hair smooth & smells fantastic, however my curls appreciate the No Poo & One Condition better.
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
Just the right amount of cleansing and moisturization so it protects fine delicate curly hair. I like that it doesn't weigh my hair down. I'm not a fan of the overly sweet scent but love the larger size.

Would give it -1 stars if I could.  I switched from low-poo (which I had used successfully for a year) to this, and after about a month my hair started shedding like crazy -- enough to make a Barbie wig after every shampoo.  I didn't shed any other time of the day except for washing and styling my hair.  I stopped using the Deva line shampoo and conditioner month ago and am shedding a normal amount now.  I don't know what the hell is in here that would cause this, but beware.....
"
"Deva Curl Delight Low-Poo and One-Condition Duo, 32 Ounce","
I'm a big fan of the Deva Curl products. I've been using them for years now with fabulous results. My stylist recommended that I try the Delight series because it's made for wavy hair, rather than out and out curly hair. I tried this product once and I will never use it again. The smell is TERRIBLE. It's like cheap, knock off CK cologne. It took a week to get the smell out of my hair and pillow and shower. The whole bathroom reeked. DO NOT BUY.

Edited 5/9/17After more research I found this product line to be on the Deva Curl website. Apparently there is this completely different product line. I was thinking this was the ""original"" scent. It is not. Although I still do not like this scent and it's consistancy it does seem to be real Deva Curl. I know now there are different lines within Deva Curl.Original review:This is not Deva Curl! Products smells and feels completely different! I contacted Deva Curl to see if they changed their formula to explain the new scent and product but they assured me they hadn't! Will not buy again! Do not buy!

Within 12 hours of using this shampoo my scalp starts to itch. Within 24 hours it itches so badly I have to wash it again to get the itching to stop. As soon as I go back to using regular shampoo the itching stops.  I ordered mine directly from the company so I know it's an authentic product. I hate to throw it out because it is so expensive but I really didn't notice that it made any difference in my hair anyway.

I recently tried this product for my wavy hair and finally, I can have wavy hair that doesn't frizz up, feel crunchy, or look cheap - until now, I had to always blow out my hair straight.  Now, instead I can add some Deva styling cream, scrunch, and let it air dry into pretty voluminous waves.  Thank you DevaCurl.  I also like the smell, it is fresh but not too fruity or floral.  I tried the no poo and didn't feel it worked for my hair and the smell was too minty.

I’m actually a bit disappointed. My packaged arrived and inside the cleanser was all over inside of the package. I had a previous package delivered the day before and it was fine. The outside package that was delivered wasn’t crushed or anything so I am assuming it was the hair company itself because it was inside the clear package. I lost a good bit of it due to the miss handling .

It smells different.  I don't feel cleaning while shampooing.  The real one I used had feeling sensation.  It had peppermint in it and it smelled great and felt cleaning.  It is not the same DevaCurl as I used.

Keep your hair healthy, no unnecessary fragrance, lather, it just cleans the hair without all the things you do not need to do the job. Won't weigh down your hair. Will detangle your hair and keep it's natural soft curls.

I've used the different iterations of the no-poo cleanser offered by Devacurl and I don't like this one as much. I wash my hair every two days, and when using this one, it gets funky quicker than the other no-poo cleansers I've used. It also doesn't have the minty feeling on the scalp as the earlier products.

"Devacurl No-Poo Original Cleanser, 32oz","
My life has been a curly-haired journey, full of ups and downs and everything in between. I have gotten too many bad haircuts to count.  At each salon, I am told of yet another product that will “change my life”, and “make me more confident”! Hairstylists with pin-straight hair recommend all sorts of chemical-saturated pastes. My hair was tired of being dragged down by mediocre products.  I was ready to settle for below average curls, but DevaCurl wasn’t.DevaCurl is the first experience I had with hair products designed specifically with curly-haired girls in mind. What a magical experience! Girls with curly hair were cutting my curly hair. Some brands have one product that is for curly hair but the problem is: there are so many types of curly hair! DevaCurl has recognized that. They have Decadent No-Poo for girls with coarse, kinky hair and Low-Poo for girls with relative low curl-patterns. DevaCurl is for girls with all curl types. They want to make your curls the best that they can be.DevaCurl’s No-Poo contains no sulfates, parabens, or silicone. There are no harsh chemicals that will damage your hair or stunt your curls. The ingredients they use, such as grapeseed oil and peppermint oil, are designed to gently cleanse your hair without stripping your hair of its natural oils, plus No-Poo smells amazing.  I thought that the more lather, the better; but DevaCurl’s No-Poo has zero lather because the lather is created by parabens and silicones which are detrimental to your hair. After every wash with No-Poo, I leave my bathroom with my curls bouncing and a smile on my face. I give DevaCurl’s NoPoo a five out of five rating. My hair has never been the same after using this product. My curls are more defined, more moisturized, and I am more assured. I can’t wait to try more of their products. DevaCurl didn’t just sell me a shampoo; they sold me confidence.
"
"Devacurl No-Poo Original Cleanser, 32oz","
This weighed my hair down until it was straight and I had to revert to a “bad hair day” ponytail.  Plus I didn’t like the smell— like a chemical cleaning product.  The product description says it smells like “roses and mint.”  I don’t understand how that is possible.  I wish I had known how heavy it was before buying it; it is not for fine or medium hair.
"
"Devacurl No-Poo Original Cleanser, 32oz","
Product lid was not on properly. Product leaked out during shipment. I also did not see any selection to have the item replaced. It was returned and if I still wanted it I will need to repurchase.  Funny thing, now I am not seeing the product for the same price. The Devi product itself is always a good product for Very thick and very curly crazy hair. I am always satisfied with the product it’s self, but I’m very disappointed in Amazon at the moment. We order a lot through Amazon - continually and for several years now. So this is a very disappointing incident!

"Devacurl No-Poo Original Cleanser, 32oz","
I invested money into deva curl products and they dried my curls. My curls were damaged and got even worse. I was using each product as described on the label. I can't even return my product because it passed the return mark but there was no way of me knowing if it worked or not without using it a few times. I am extremely disappointed on how this product worked. I wish I could return these products and get my money back.

Been using this product for years.  My hair is definitely less frizzy and dry overall. I can't see myself ever going back to a detergent based shampoo with my thick, curly, prone to dryness,  chemically treated hair. It's lovely.  Don't mind the smell either.  It's mild

"Devacurl No-Poo Original Cleanser, 32oz","
I have been using Devacurl products for over a year with no issues. I purchased the no poo and one condition a couple months ago. Since then my hair has been falling out and my scalp has been unbearably itchy. I switched to another brand and those issues resolved. I believe there is also a lawsuit coming against Devacurl as many others are experiencing the same issues.

I had been getting buzz cuts because I was so sick of my thick, dull, frizzy hair. It's now grown in to a jaw length layered bob. It is not frizzy at all and it kind of looks like I roll it with curlers or use the curling iron on it. The best part is that my scalp doesn't bother me like it used to. For me, it works better than Head and Shoulders for flakes and dry scalp. I don't remember my scalp feeling this normal since I was a small child. It seems a little expensive, but for me (my hair is in botticelli curls when long and if I let it dry naturally - it is very wavy if I use a diffuser and then sleep on it) I can use it as a 2-in-1 and not use more of it as a leave in conditioner. That way I'm not using as much so it lasts longer and is not so expensive. I am very happy with this product. Family members with straight hair have also tried it and it has not worked as well for them (as you would expect).

First of all, I'm pretty easy-going when it comes to scents. I don't think I've ever had a complaint about the way a shampoo smelled...that said, I hate the smell of this stuff. It is an overwhelming, I can tasted in my mouth, nauseating perfume smell. I feel like I'm brushing my teeth with a bottle of perfume. Like, old-lady cheap perfume. Yuck. So, I'm trying to hold my breath while finishing the bottle.As far as cleansing. I feel like it cleanses pretty well. I'm new to co-washing, so I don't have another one to compare it to yet (I may update this later!). I was nervous to try co-washing, but was pleasantly surprised at how clean and soft my hair felt. However, this does contain glycerin and I found that if I try to use it multiple days in a row, my hair gets limp and weighed down. If I use it in a rotation--in between my regular shampoos, or in  between/following a clarifying shampoo, I've found that it helps my 2b/2c curls bounce back and adds some shine.  I'll add more after I've tried a couple other brands/formulations and see how it compares.

I have lost tons of hair and length using Devacurl products. It fried my super long curly hair so badly and the company won’t reply to me about it. I’ve had approx 8-10 inches in places just break off. My hair is absolutely ruined. Unbelievable :-/ very sad and distrought.Beware if you have very long colored or fragile hair.

Update, this has now happened twice now.  Accidentally reordered from the same seller and the same thing happened.  This time it looks like it might be the right product inside the bottle, but it was delivered a mess, and there's no way it's new, it's not even full.Sorry, but it was so obviously refilled and kind of sloppily done.  The outside was super sticky and covered in gel and the top pump wasn’t taped down like it usually is with a new bottle. Also, it wasn’t even filled all the way.  I’ve been ordering this stuff for years and I know the smell and color of the Arc Angel product. This might have been the ultra defining gel because it was clear but Arc Angel is a soft orange and I KNOW they haven’t changed that because I was just in for a deva cut a few weeks ago.

Like others have posted, this gel is awesome, when you receive the correct product. I received what looked and smelled like the Ultra Defining gel in an Arc Angel gel bottle. Ultra Defining gel is clear-ish, while the Arc Angel gel is orange and smells citrusy. Both items (my original order and the replacement) were sold by Amazon.com LLC, so even the biggest sellers can be affected.Before trying this product, I was afraid to use gel on my curly hair because of high school experiences with crunchy, wet-looking hair and white flakes. This gel is different. Your hair will get ""crunchy"" but that's just the gel cast to help set your curls. Once your hair is dry, scrunch your curls a bit to get rid of the cast and you have great looking curls for days. The product smells great too. I keep mine in the shower, so I can apply to my curls and scrunch out the excess liquid before getting out of the shower.

I’m of mixed race with super fine and frizzy tiny curls. I’m 50 years old and have been a product junky for most of my life, with mixed success. But I always wanted my hair to swing, and to hold it’s all-over curl, like it does when wet or freshly washed. I discovered DevaCurl 1 year ago by asking a black customer of mine what she used in her lovely curls. My hair is now perfect every day, even when I wake. When I get a haircut, I no longer need drastic damage cuts, and so my hair is the longest it’s been. The secret is to follow Deva Curls instruction book. 1. No other non-Deva products (this is non-silicone, non oil, so hydration can soak in). 2. Filter on shower head ($25 or so at home improvement stores, easy to self-install). 3. Use a satin pillowcase or head covering at night to stop friction (graceeleyae.com products recommended). 4. I only use 3 DevaCurl products. No-poo, Decadence Conditioner and Arc Gel. According to my hairdresser, I don’t need any of the deep conditioner. After washing and combing, re-wet hair, carefully squeeze out excess water, and soak strands thoroughly with conditioner, DevaCurl says until strands feel like seaweed. Use a microfiber towel or tee shirt to carefully squeeze out excess water. Put copious amounts of gel in. Hair will still be soft, nongreasy, and even comb-able (when wet), in future. 5. Wash hair as little as is necessary. I wash weekly. 6. For daily maintenance, I stand outside of shower, and moisten my hair in the running warm water. Re-squeeze with microfiber towel, finger comb if necessary and reapply more conditioner and gel. First time in my life that strangers stop me in the street daily to complement my hair! Products not cheap, but I’m no longer throwing away unworkable products or paying for Brazilian Blowouts, or relaxers, etc. I wasn’t paid in anyway for this recommendation.

I have heard a lot of good reviews for DevaCurl. So, after watching a video of girl with beautiful curly hair; I decided to give this one product a try. I needed a product to hold the shape of my curl and keep it. Also keep it from fizzing. My hair is definitely prone to frizz. I have fine hair and plenty of it and it is a little on the dry side. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I washed my hair in the evening and let it air dry for an hour; then dried it with a hair dryer to finish it. I slept on it all night and woke up with my curls still in tact. No Frizz!!! I showered the next morning, which will cause my hair to get damp and wet in some places. Still No Frizz!!! I am planning on purchasing a few of the other products I feel I need for my type of hair. I am very surprised it worked so well. I have tried so many other products in the past. I have chosen from expensive lines to inexpensive lines and haven't found one that works this well. This is a good size bottle so for the price it's not very expensive.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
You have to use a lot of product and wait forever for it to dry in your hair. But when it does dry and you shake your hair to fluff it looks amazing!!! It last all day. And I found that if you spritz with water the next day your curls pop right back. Another huge downside is that if you have dry, thin or weak hair this product will make your hair fall out more. I used this product only a few times and each time I washed it out, a lot of hair came out too. So I won't use it anymore. I use Bella Curls now. Same effect and no hair falling out.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I LOVE LOVE Love this gel!  The key to getting a great result v/s a good result is application.  You need to apply it in the shower while your hair is dripping wet, and use a ton more than you thought you needed.  Your curls will hold with zero frizz.  It is amazing

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Originally, I really hated this and thought I had wasted my money. But after several weeks and trying it different ways, I’m now okay with it. I still think my hair feels drier when I use Arc Angel, but at least it is holding curl now. I HAVE to diffuse my hair without heat when using it. Heat =extra dry and frizzy results.Original review: I can’t believe how much I dislike this product. I usually love Devacurl products, but I certainly don’t like this one. My hair looks better if I literally do nothing to it after washing it than the past three days of using Arc Angel. Within 30 minutes my hair is already frizzy, flat, and lifeless. How does a curling gel manage to REMOVE the curl??? I’ll stick with my Ultra Defining Gel. The only positive thing I can say about Arc Angel is that it smells good.

I was recommended this product by a cousin who is a professional hair stylist. This gel is amazing at holding my curls! I naturally have a very slight wave, more towards straight hair, but when it's wet before I brush it, it's slightly wavy. I can use this gel and scrunch my hair and it holds the prettiest curls! The more often I use it, the better the curls look! First photo is me with my naturally straight with a slight single wave hair and a fan who fell asleep at the game. It was a night game and I was outside all day long. Second pic is me with the curls and the lead vocalist of the band Friday Pilots Club. The pic was taken at night and I was at an outdoor music festival all day yet the curls still stayed. Third pic is me and my sister, again with the curls. I had worked all day and then drove an hour to meet her at an outdoor concert in a park and again the curls look great! As you can see, this gel creates curly miracles and my hair still looks flexible, soft, and free all day long!

I have wavy/curly hair and had been using the light weight Deva Curl gel, but wanted to try something with a little more holding power.  Arc Angel is awesome.  It provides good hold and yet still leaves my hair feeling soft.  While the hair is drying, there is a feeling of it being a little crusty, but once it's dry and you scrunch the hair, that cast breaks up and leave the hair feeling great.

I needed a product to hold the shape of my curl and keep it. Also keep it from fizzing. My hair is definitely prone to frizz. I have fine hair and plenty of it and it is a little on the dry side. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I washed my hair in the evening and let it air dry for an hour; then dried it with a hair dryer to finish it. I slept on it all night and woke up with my curls still in tact. No Frizz!!! I showered the next morning, which will cause my hair to get damp and wet in some places. Still No Frizz!!! I am planning on purchasing a few of the other products I feel I need for my type of hair. I am very surprised it worked so well. I have tried so many other products in the past. I have chosen from expensive lines to inexpensive lines and haven't found one that works this well. This is a good size bottle so for the price it's not very expensive.

You have to use a lot of product and wait forever for it to dry in your hair. But when it does dry and you shake your hair to fluff it looks amazing!!! It last all day. And I found that if you spritz with water the next day your curls pop right back. Another huge downside is that if you have dry, thin or weak hair this product will make your hair fall out more. I used this product only a few times and each time I washed it out, a lot of hair came out too. So I won't use it anymore. I use Bella Curls now. Same effect and no hair falling out.

I LOVE LOVE Love this gel!  The key to getting a great result v/s a good result is application.  You need to apply it in the shower while your hair is dripping wet, and use a ton more than you thought you needed.  Your curls will hold with zero frizz.  It is amazing

Originally, I really hated this and thought I had wasted my money. But after several weeks and trying it different ways, I’m now okay with it. I still think my hair feels drier when I use Arc Angel, but at least it is holding curl now. I HAVE to diffuse my hair without heat when using it. Heat =extra dry and frizzy results.Original review: I can’t believe how much I dislike this product. I usually love Devacurl products, but I certainly don’t like this one. My hair looks better if I literally do nothing to it after washing it than the past three days of using Arc Angel. Within 30 minutes my hair is already frizzy, flat, and lifeless. How does a curling gel manage to REMOVE the curl??? I’ll stick with my Ultra Defining Gel. The only positive thing I can say about Arc Angel is that it smells good.

I was recommended this product by a cousin who is a professional hair stylist. This gel is amazing at holding my curls! I naturally have a very slight wave, more towards straight hair, but when it's wet before I brush it, it's slightly wavy. I can use this gel and scrunch my hair and it holds the prettiest curls! The more often I use it, the better the curls look! First photo is me with my naturally straight with a slight single wave hair and a fan who fell asleep at the game. It was a night game and I was outside all day long. Second pic is me with the curls and the lead vocalist of the band Friday Pilots Club. The pic was taken at night and I was at an outdoor music festival all day yet the curls still stayed. Third pic is me and my sister, again with the curls. I had worked all day and then drove an hour to meet her at an outdoor concert in a park and again the curls look great! As you can see, this gel creates curly miracles and my hair still looks flexible, soft, and free all day long!

I have wavy/curly hair and had been using the light weight Deva Curl gel, but wanted to try something with a little more holding power.  Arc Angel is awesome.  It provides good hold and yet still leaves my hair feeling soft.  While the hair is drying, there is a feeling of it being a little crusty, but once it's dry and you scrunch the hair, that cast breaks up and leave the hair feeling great.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I have tried so hard to like this product. I started with the Ultra Defining gel and when that failed I tried the Arc Angel gel. I have 2 C hair and although it doesn't leave it crunchy or hard it had NO HOLD whatsoever. I tried it over and over with different amounts, air dry vs diffusing, also with Deva Super Cream and the results were the same, no good whatsoever. I just don't get the hype over these products. If you want something that works for 2 b or 2 c hair try Jessie Curl Spiralicious gel, best product I have found so far out of the seriously hundreds I have tried.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I LOVE this gel! I’m new to the curly girl method and Ive seen that a lot of people are constantly trying new products and switching it up but honestly I like this gel I might just stick with it. It is not sticky in between my hands, the scent is not too strong but does leave your hair smelling fresh. I have low porosity hair and use only about a dime size on each side of my head (I have short hair) and that’s enough for me. I use a diffuser and it creates a nice light cast (if I used more i believe it would create more of a cast). And then I scrunch out the crunch using praying hands and it leaves my hair bouncy with nice hold all day but doesn’t even look like I have product in it! Also note, I decided on this deva gel because on their website it stated it would be good for low porosity hair, so I would suggest looking at that to find the one that fits you.

By far my favorite product ever!!! I switched to all vegan hair products for about a year now and no heat on my hair what so ever. This product gives my hair that extra bounce to my natural long curls and without leaving white flaky stuff. I can touch my hair through out the day without worrying that my curls are going to fall. It gives just the right amount of hold and shine to my curls. Naturally my hair I is curly but frizzy and not a lot of volume. Also this product has a nice light sweet scent. Better than other gels I've used by this brand. Definitely will stick to this one for keeps.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I like to let my curls dry without brushing them.  The arc angel makes a stiff curl ""cast"" to support the curl formation while the hair dries.  Once the hair is dry, I hang my head upside down and scrunch curls, which breaks the curl cast, and the crunchiness disappears, leaving me with soft, defined curls.  I've been using this method for 6 months now.  I've also been using the same bottle of Arc Angel for 6 months, so while it seemed pricey at first, it's really not.  Product has a light, citrusy scent, but not enough to upset my sensitive scalp.  I will be buying this product again.

FAKE! I used this for years and thought they changed the formula cause it seemed watered down. It was doing nothing for my hair. Saw my stylist today and she didnt even believe I had product in it. I wish I could return. Dont waste your money.

Arrived on time / packaged well.This is far from cheap but it’s worth the price. You do not need to use a large amount, it works best is you don’t over do it.Leaves my hair w/a soft bouncy curl. After a shower I use the gel & let my hair air dry. Once it’s almost dry I use a blow dryer on low air flow & high heat (that’s just me folks) and scrunch it lightly to get the soft bounce.This get holds well & smells nice.

Buyer Beware: I received a fake product. I couldn't understand why my hair was not turning out similar to when it was styled at the salon. Then I noticed that my Arc Angel Gel did not have the same color, consistency or smell as the product sold at my salon. Unfortunately I did not notice this until well after the return period.

I purchased about a month ago and gave it 3 solid weeks of use. However after the first few days I noticed how dry my protein sensitive 3A curly hair was becoming, it was awful. I tried applying it in distant ways, etc but I just had to stop using it. The second I speed using this my hair changed back to soft, not dry, and looked healthier again. I'm not sure what was in this product to make my hair react this was but I'd highly caution anyone who has protein sensitive hair to think hard before purchasing. Instead I'd recommend Moptop and Jessicurl products.

I hate it. My hair felt disgusting. It has a flash drying effect on my hair. I put it on very moisturized slippery wet hair, and my hair started to feel dry and crispy. After it fully air dried my curls looked okay for about 5 minutes. Then I had more frizz around the crown of my head than i have in long time. I have prorein sensitive loose curls and waves, and honestly it hates practically everything. I was really hopeful this would be the one for me and my search would ve over. Guess not

Packaged Perfect, no leakage, but I’m not sure this product is for me.  It fills my hair.  I will continue to use it, it may be an issue with how much I’m using or how I’m using it ( before leave-in or after).  I will try different ways, to see what works best for my hair.

My wife uses this DevaCurl several time a week, she has curly and fine hair and it doesn't make her hair look oily or greasy when she uses it and it's not heavy. When she uses it, her hair curls likes she wants it to. I will buy this again when she runs out in a year, this was a great value for what you get.

I don't know if this is the real stuff or not, but I'm not impressed. It smells like lemon lime Gatorade to start. I've used it a couple times now and followed directions of starting with soaking wet hair and air drying. Meh. Still a frizzy and not much control. My hair still feels dry and I got the same results as using any old gel. For anyone reading this I recommend instead Renpure coconut creme curling jelly. Not as pricey doing the job this gel claims to. Good luck curly girls!

I purchased this product for the first time through Amazon. I noticed that several other reviewers mentioned receiving the wrong product but I do believe that I got the right one based on the smell and color description.I love this gel! It really defines my curls without making them super crunchy and I am able to add lots of volume with a diffuser without too much frizz. Sometimes I add other products in at the same time, mostly like a conditioner or cream but the gel still helps with volume.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Beware, this is a fake. I am very familiar with Deva Curl products, have been using them for years. Just received from Amazon, and the color of gel was incorrect, and it smelled. I see others have same complaint, I could not find a way to notify Amazon on this issue. This is clearly a counterfeit and disappointed. I then purchased it direct from Deva Curl, and product arrived perfect. It is a great product.

LOVE THIS STUFF.  When applying it, I thought it would dry crunchy - but it doesn't!  This stuff is magical!  i used all DevaCurl products now! I have 3A curly hair, fine, but think hair.  Used this with the No Poo cleanser, the DevaCurl conditioner that you like, then the B-Leave DC product, then s little bit of this stuff - and it's AWESOME!

As I was warned about Amazon vendors watering down the DevaCurl products, the first thing I did when I received this product was compare it to the genuine product. It is noticeably more watery. My DevaCut hairstylist had informed me that genuine DevaCurl products will never be so inexpensive as this, but it’s worth it if you find the products work for you and your meant-to-be-beautiful curls! Returning this bogus crap and ordering the real product!

I've tried the devacurl line with all the hype about it.......honestly, I have not been happy with the stylesrs.  I like the no poo shampoo and conditioner.......i was not impressed with thos gel.  I first tried the regular gel, but it was like adding thickened, scented water to my hair.  And this one did add a little more hold, but still not what I needed.  I was very excited to try this and wanted to love it, but I did not.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I love this gel as it does smell good and leaves your hair soft once you break the gel cast. However, as soon as my hair hits any humidity, my frizz comes out and my hair goes up into a bun. I have a deva cut and follow all care/style instructions, use the no poo cleanser and conditioner, super cream, and hairspray and still doesn’t help. If I don’t hit humidity, my hair looks great!

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I’m used to the other Deva gel. This gel left my hair gummy and frizzy. It created frizzy clumps. I applied it as directed to soaking wet hair after leave in conditioner. The other Deva gel works very well in my 3A low porosity curls. This version  has a floral/fabric softener scent, whereas the original version is a sweet/lemongrassy scent.

I love this stuff and have been using Deva Curl products for over a decade.  They, along with my Deva trained stylist, make all the difference.HOWEVER- the packaging on the shipments leaves much to be desired. These bottles are heavy. They are often packed with either just paper for padding or nothing at all- in boxes that are clearly too large so the bottles jostle around a great deal. In my latest shipment one of the noses on the pump is snapped clean off.  Thankfully, I can transfer the pump from my current bottle. But damage like this is a not infrequent problem. I know other reviewers have mentioned the same kind of issue. Please pack and wrap heavy bottles of expensive product securely so they don’t roll around in the box and end up breakin somehow! Please!

I really wish this would have worked for me better for my “wash n gos”, I have coily courts (3c-4a type)  it slightly defined my hair and only would last me a day. But it definitely worked fine for twist outs, braid outs and other styles using perm rods or flexi rods leaving my hair soft and lasting about 3-4 days until it becomes a frizz ball. By the way, it smells very citrus. I recommended mostly for those with loose curls and definitely not much for those with type 4a+ (If you are doing a wash n go).

Product: I love this gel! Great hold and soft curls for my huge hair. Way cheaper than Ouidad climate control @ $60 which has been my staple for 3 years!!Boxing: terrible!

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Oh, MAN, I am using products from three different lines that I love! Wen cleansing conditioners, replenishing treatment mists, and body creams are great. Ouidad leave-ins including Whipped Curls are awesome. Then there's THIS Deva Arc Angel Defining gel along with their Low-poo! I really need to figure out something here. I have yet to try Ouidad's Shampoos, and now that I really like this Arc Angel gel, I probably won't try Ouidad stylers. So,  perhaps I should keep doing what I'm doing as long as it works.I can't believe I had this Arc Angel Defining gel in my arsenal of hair supplies for Over three years now! Purchased March 14, 2014 used it once, had flakes and little hold, put it away in a huge plastic zip bag to give away. I did not want to throw it away since I used so little of it. Lately, I have been looking for a styling agent as I prefer a little bit of hold. I had a little bit of Kinky-Curly Curling Custard left from a couple of years ago (never used straight out of jar, just removed some with spoon into another container) that I recently used. I've always had a love and hate with that. It has made my hair stringy, with rubbery crunchiness and left it difficult to dry at my roots. But there were occasional ""good"" days with it. Again, after not using it for approx. two years, I decided to try it again after cleansing with Wen and with Ouidad's leave-ins.  Long story short---You CAN'T mix Kinky-Curly with A-N-Y-thing otherwise you'll have a hot mess....And, the Knot Today leave-in eventually builds up on my hair. Fact is Kinky-Curly is the most all natural thick gelled styler I have ever come across.  I Tried to Make myself use it.  So, I tried Arc Angel again for the second time since I had it. I used Deva Curl Low-Poo followed with Wen as leave-in - then Ouidad Moisture Lock - then Whipped Curls - finally Arc Angel (I flat ironed last winter soooo, the more good things I can put into my hair the better) I have the Deva Green Hand diffuser but I let it air dry. My hair looks great. I used such a small amount of product and got excellent results. It is shiny, Not Crunchy, hard, or stiff. The cast is super light, there really isn't much of a cast to break. In the morning it will be just a fabulous after sleeping on it...I know I should be doing the unicorn/pineapple thing but I'm just not doing that right now as I have a satin pillowcase.The problem when first used may have been due to styling out of the shower (not sure). I came to Amazon to read reviews on this again and found many reviewers stated to use in the shower, and that's what I did! Thanks for your helpful tips!UPDATE: The next day my hair looked and felt great. However....it Flakes on dark clothing, surprisingly not on hair. The flakes are so fine it looks like dandruff or something. Soooo, now I'm thinking that was probably the reason why I only used once and put it away. I still like it as it defines without heaviness. But, what you wear matters with this. Took one star off. :/

I've been using this product on and off for about 4 years now. I typically use it in my hair after I am done showering and then let my hair air dry or use very minimal heat. The more I use the more ""crunch"" I will have to my hair. I have naturally curly hair but they are not super tight curls. I would recommend a try for anyone who wants some hold to their hair with a nice smell to go along with it. The smell isn't overbearing, which is nice. I also use the Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner as well.

I have 2b/2c hair that loves moisture, so I thought the Arc Angel would be a good fit. Unfortunately, what it adds in moisture it lacks in hold. Mind you, I need a LOT of hold. When I don't put product in my hair, my entire top layer doesn't form curls. As it dries, it slowly inflates to a poofy, formless mass. I find DevaCurl's Ultra Defining Gel to work well when I layer it over Eden Curl Defining Creme and plop for 20 minutes. My curls get the help they need to make reasonably defined ringlets. The Arc Angel just doesn't work for me.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I love, love, love this gel.  You need to apply it when your hair is soaking wet which takes some getting used to.  You absolutely cannot touch it again until your hair is dry.  My hair takes forever to dry so this is also challenging.  BUT, then when you break the cast and fluff up your hair you will have the best, softest curls ever.  It doesn't feel like you have any product in it at all and your curls last for days.

I have 3C/4A curls and this gel really doesn’t do much for my hair. If you have hair types similar to mine and like really defined curls I wouldn’t recommend this product. It does define your curls but mine were left fizzy looking and not as defined as I like them. After using this I usually just wear my hair in updos because it’s not defined enough to wear as a wash and go. I do use the entire system so that doesn’t have anything to with my results, this product just doesn’t work for my hair.

She loves the softness of it and I’ll give it that, it is soft but Cat Walk Curls Rock works better for me.  I’ll continue to use the remainder of this product for normal styling but if I want to hold a scrunched look I will use the Curls Rock.

I didn't originally read the reviews because I thought I knew what I was buying, I guess that will teach me next time.

I have been using the lighter hold and purchased this to see if it works better. I'd say ""no"" simply because both products work so amazingly well that I want to always have one or the other on hand. This product does not leave your hair sticky or crunchy. It refreshing curls and helps keep them from being frizzy. My curls are from a perm and this defining gel gave them better definition that simply washing and conditioning did. This product is a keeper!

Finally found something that my curly hair loves without drying it out.  I can not say enough positive things about the Deva Care system.  I have gone through 40 years having to wash my hair every day because the hair products I was using was making my hair dirty, frizzy and and dried out.  Someone recommend I try the deva care system, said ""You need to stop treating your hair like it is Caucasian as it isn't).  I started using deva care and I get continuous compliments as well as only having to wash my hair every 4 days.  My hair hasn't been happier since!

I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls. I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren't any better than their cheaper counterparts. Don't waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products. Head to Target for the same type of shampoo, Frizz-Free stuff, gel & condition without bruising your credit card. My opinion only, but I've found better products for my curly hair at Ross', TJ Max and Marshalls. Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz. It's cheap & it works.

I was excited to try this but alas, I was extremely disappointed. It makes my hair very frizzy and my curls are not defined at *all*.

It also seems to have a weird residue and I'll have to wash it today after using it for 2 days (usually I only wash my hair a few times a month). Yes it smells good but smell does not make my curls appealing! I'm actually going to try and return it and try a different product. I have much better luck with Garnier Fructise natural gel.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
This stuff is amazing! I heard about this through a friend and had to try it. I have very curly, soft hair. When I use other firm gel products, my hair becomes crunchy or straw like. If I use the flexible gel, my hair is too frizzy with undefined curls. I do advise you to use it directly as stated in the directions. Your hair will have a stuff cast on it that you will need to scrunch once it is dry to break the cast and create beautiful, soft, defined curls. I also purchased the shampoo and conditioner but have not used it yet. Waiting until my other products run out. Once I am using all Deva Care products, I can't imagine the improvement!

Smells like citrus but thats all thats really good about it. I noticed my hair began breaking off while using this

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I have curly, coarse hair. This product holds it in place without stickiness. You have to finger comb the product thru totally wet hair, scrunch, let dry.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
This stuff might work if you never have frizz problems but if you have curly hair that you're looking to tame keep searching.  This gel is thin.  No matter how much I put in it won't keep my naturally curly corkicelli hair from looking like I have a second type of hair haloing my head.  I was expecting more from a product from the writer of the book I read that taught me how to properly care for my curls.  I'm giving up on this gel after using it for a few days.  I'll have to go back to my cheap Aussie gel until I find something better. :( Positive- Smells good.- Low toxin levels, great EWG score.Negative- Doesn't control frizz at all.- Very thin consistency.

Moldy shampoo?!?? I’m not sure how this is even a thing! I purchased this last year (I don’t use a ton of shampoo so this lasts a while!!) and today while showering I noticed it was dark color and picked it up to discover mold!!! I don’t know how long it’s been that way which really disturbs me! I’ve never had this problem before, but I’ll be thinking twice about ordering again.

I love that you can get this on Amazon this gel is AMAZING for my 3b-3c some 4 A curls that are frizzy and often dehydrated. This helps to define my curls and make them luscious and frizz free! The shipping is fast,the customer service is good, love the big size.. all perfect.

I have thick blonde curly hair that was prone to fizzing. For some reason all of the expensive hair products I was using such as Oribe and Davines was not helping. I did my usual research on Amazon and found the reviews on this, the DevaCare No Poo and Conditioner and this Angel Firm Defining gel, it worked wonders on my hair and I was able to wear it curly again. Definitely would recommend this to anyone experiencing fizzy unmanageable hair. I still have a few bad hair days when the weather is really humid but overall this has made a huge difference.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
The product came in the correct packaging. But once I went to use it, I found that it was watery and not a gel content. The smell is also not as strong as it should be. This is a false product.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
My hair seems to be more frizzy with this product,  I like the original much better, I stopped using it for now and using a less expensive gel that works much better
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I like this gel because it doesn't leave a lot of buildup on my hair.  I use it for my wash and go hairstyle.  It really makes the curls pop and  my 4a hair  is soft not hard and crunchy.

Not the real stuff, don't buy.

My hair still frizzes when i use this unless i use an INSANE AMOUNT of product which weighs my hair down and makes it look really wet and drippy.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I have used this product before and something was funny about it this time. It looked and smelled the same but not quite.... the bottle looked cheaper, the gel had a more watery consistency and was separating, and it didn't hold half as well as the one I bought from the store. I wouldn't trust buying this product online, particularly from this seller.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I have been using Deva Curl Arc angel for 8 years. I took a chance and ordered it from Amazon. Well I should have listened to the other reviews. This is NOT real. Doesn’t smell right or have even close to the real consistency of the real Arc Angel

Hold my messy curly mane in check without feeling sticky.  Smells great!

I'm a hair stylist and this gel is awesome. Massive shine and will not leave your hair feeling dirty. Can revert hair in the morning and resctivates .
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
This did not work as well as I was expecting given the reviews. My hair is very thick and dry so I was got this gel hoping it would hold in extra moisture and define my curls. Immediately after putting it into my sopping wet hair (as suggested) it began to frizz and strands began to separate instead of stick together. Considering my hair was wet, it's a bad sign that this gel was already making my hair frizzy. When it dried it did not form a curl cast and left my hair frizzy and dry and sticky. Would not recommend.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
As expected! Perfect and convenient! Works great if use as directed. Worth the price.

I love this product for my naturally wavy hair. It leaves my waves soft, not crunchy and doesn’t feel like i have a ton of product in my hair. I keep trying new products and wind up coming right back to deva curl.

Have been using the smaller bottle thought it was time to switch for the value size. Definitely worth it.

Gel works really well. Do not like the scent I’ve noticed all the deva products smell pretty bad.

I've been using DevaCurl for a few years and this is NOT the Arc Angel Control Styling Gel. I had thought something was wrong so I purchased the same product locally and it was completely different. Too bad my return/refund window closed. It took me a while to figure it out. I am furious and feel duped.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I bought the jumbo bottle and less than half way through the bottle, it is not even gel anymore. It is the consistency of water and is not doing the job of gel. Total rip off.  I will never by devacurl products from Amazon again.

I knew this would be a low poo shampoo but it still seems like you need way to many pumps of shampoo to get enough to clean your hair.  I feel like my scalp doesn’t smell clean after washing with a lot of shampoo.  I also feel, after 2-3 weeks of use, that there is a waxy buildup on my hair.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I know this product is supposed to be for people with curly hair, but I just had to give it a try.  I have long, straight caucasian hair.  A hair stylist told a friend of mine with short straight hair that Deva Curl products would make her hair curl.  She tried it and it worked. It gave her waves and body.  So, I had to give it a try.  I have hair where a couple pieces curl in the rain but that's about it.  I bought Deva Curl Low Poo, Deva Curl One Conditioner, and Deva Care Arc Angel Gel.  After using the cleanser and conditioner, I dried my hair with a towel and combed it out.  I could see waves starting to happen.  I scrunched in the Arc Angel Gel, and I had waves and body.  I really couldn't believe it.  It made my straight fine hair look wavy, almost like I had a body perm.  It can also give that slightly messy, wind blown look.This gel has a strong hold and gives nice body.  Your hair still has bounce and freedom to move.  It does not leave your hair stiff and brittle.  I plan to use it when I use my rollers to curl my hair next time.  I think it will give it great hold without that crunchy feeling.My mother has shoulder length, straight, thin, baby fine caucasian hair that is damaged and color treated.  She is hooked on this gel.  It gives her hair fullness and body.  It doesn't curl her hair, but it makes her hair look fuller and lay better.  Without it, her hair looks stringy and uncombed.  She has no natural curl at all, but I have some and I think that's why it curls my hair and not hers.

A total waste of money. My hair was dry and the product flakes when dry and that was wash day. The next day looked just like the bad hair videos for this product on YouTube.

Someone watered this gel down. It's like water. The consistency and feel are not the same as I have purchased from other places.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Works great. Smells nice. Have noticed that it can be a bit drying on the hair ends over time. I have problems with conditioners giving me rashes if I use too much or leave too much product in my hair, so it is a problem keeping my hair moisturized. I can't use Deva Care's No or Low Poo because of breakouts/rashes, but I have really sensitive skin and lots of allergies to all kinds of products.

Great gel.  Love that after your hair dries, you scrunch again to release the cast and soft curls stay.  I used to only use Paul Mitchell sculpting foam but this is now my go to.  You really cannot use too much.

You have to know how to use it..In the shower after finger combing your hair with conditioner, lightly rinse with cold water.Scrunch this through your hair, and use A LOT!Then scrunch with a microfiber cloth and try to let it air dry after that.Once its completely dry it will be hard, just crunch the stiffness out of your hair and your ready to go!

not the correct product—wrong color, smell, and texture. Looks and feels more like the light defining gel. Also looks like someone filled the bottle—it's not full to the top like my previous purchase, which was the right product.

If I could give a one star I would. Product leaked out of packaging when it was delivered. I should have known not to use it but I did anyway. It smelled horrible and was so runny it was like water. As soon as I used I knew it wasn’t a real Devacurl product.

I was introduced to Deva products 2 yrs ago.  I will never switch!!1. Use No Poo Shampoo2. Follow with One Conditioner3. Style with the BEST GEL ... Arc Angel4. Dry with Deva Dryer or let air dry.That's all you will ever need to make your curls look their best.People will stop you and comment on how great your hair looks.  Who could ask for anything more.

I've used Deva products for a few years now and I'll never look back. My hair has totally changed for the better. I went shampoo-free for the first time three years ago and the Deva line helped me do it.Has enough hold to give me the definition and volume that I like, non-sticky, no residue, really clean orange-ey smell. Always been safe on my hair color.Can load up when I want really individual defined curls without being too heavy and when I'm bumming around a little bit does the trick.Deva for life!!!

I've been buying this product for a couple of years now and I have loved it for my curly hair HOWEVER, this last bottle I received is different.  The formula seems to have changed and it's much more watery. I have to use twice as much as I ever did before.  I'm hoping it's just a fluke and the next bottle will be back to normal.  If it's not, I will not buy it again.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Having read other reviews the key is to buy from a specific reseller. Amazon lists the reviews of the product from all sellers and clearly quality varies by re-seller.  I used C Beauty and the gel was thick and my bottle came with a pump top.  I suggest buying from them to make sure you get a quality product.

this is one of the BEST gels that i found/use, the only thing that i didn't like when i received my order in the mail is that the bottle was leaking and 1/3 of the gel was in the plastic bag... what a waste! :(The product and brand is GREAT!

This does not leave my hair feeling the same way that the arcc angel that I buy from the salon feels like which was disappointing because I bought a huge bottle and I'm not even using it. My hair ends up being crunchy.

I love this gel. It holds and defines my 2-3b wavy-swavy hair perfectly without being hard or crunchy. I use a lot initially, then on day 2 and 3 I dampen my hair with wet hands, add one squirt of gel, and re-scrunch. Flawless! I've tried lots of other Deva products, though, and this is really the only one I like. Highly recommended!

I don't know why I was expecting more from this product.  I guess it was all of the glowing reviews.Don't expect some miracle curly hair product. It literally is just another hair gel and works just like any hair gel. It makes your hair stiff and leaves your hair dry and with residue.For the price,  if this is what you want from a hair product,  just skip this product and go for cheap drug store hair gel.

Wow what a difference!!! I've been trying out the curly girl method on my curls and tried this product for the first time last night.

I would recommend in a heart beat!

I have naturally curly hair that is thinning as I get older. This gel was way too heavy for my hair even though I applied the smallest amount. I even tried wetting my hands really good and pouring a little into my hands to thin out the gel; it still weighed down my hair. If you have really thick hair this might be good for you. I won't purchase again.

Before purchasing this gel, i was using the deva curl ultra defining gel and I loved it but wanted a gel with a little more hold. I wouldn't recommend this gel bc it felt heavy and actually made my hair look frizzier and dull. I'm going back to the ultra defining gel for sure.

I night this for my kids who have curly hair. The smell is a little weird but I got past it. Pop  What I do t like is that I feel like it dries out the hair and it does not add any shine.

This is nothing look like the original devacurl product and it is is being changed a lot in quality this change my hair texture at all it make it look dry and not curl / very disappointed

My hair looks amazing using these products!
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I use this product every day. I wash my hair one or two times a week and condition every day. This arc angel gel holds my curls nicely and all day with no frizz. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I've found.

I've been using this product for approximately 7 yrs and I have ordered from amazon almost the entire time. I have never been disappointed with this product and I highly recommend it to others.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I am not a fan of this product at all. It does not deliver on the promise of a firm hold, nor is is particularly moisturizing. There are much better products at this price point. I'll try to find creative ways to endure the rest of this bottle.

The production itself it's ok, but it arrived open and spilled all over the bag. Plus, the tip to pour the product is broken.

Best products for curly hair
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I went to a Diva salon where they used the Deva products on my hair. Amazing curls, but my hair was sticky and soo strong smelling I could hardly stand it. So I was hesitant to buy any of the products even though my curls were beautiful. After reading a ton of reviews I concluded the sticky may have been coming from the Mirrors glosser and the smell either from that as well or the shampoo. I purchased the One Conditioner and this Arc Angell and am more than happy. No strong smell, no stickiness. I just use another brand gloss. Air drying even looks nice, but carefully using a diffusing dryer really makes my 3a 3b curls pop. Not a fan of 2nd day hair yet, but 1st day hair is awsome.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Not sure if it's the real thing or not. I have tried some of there other products not the Angel gel but just seems like it may be a knock off. Does work some what to get a two star rating.

My favorite DevaCurl product! Consistency isn’t gooey and it doesn’t weigh down the curl. The scent is nice.

The devacurl system is amazing and I've never had better curls but this particular gel is a little to hard for me.

Great hold for curls without stiffness or drying like other gels!
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I was born with curly hair and always did everything I could to straighten it out. It always looked messy when left natural until I found this product. Now my curls look natural and defined. The added plus of staying in place.

This is is great gel!!! I use it with the No Poo shampoo and conditioner and they work great together. I will definitely be buying this again!

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Smells great- very citrusy. However it didn't have the right hold - for me.  I have 3A, B curls, high porosity, and my hair was great at first, but got very frizzy as the day went on.

This gel works great on freshly washed wet hair or dry hair for a mid-day pick-me-up. I LOVE the curl control Deva Care Arc Angel gel provides for my sometimes unruly natural curls!!!
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I love DevaCurl products. I have 3c curls and they are at times uncontrollable. While this product is more expensive it really does the job and is worth it. I would advise buying it at Ulta or wherever they sell it and spend the extra 10 dollars. The product I received was watered down and did not do the same job. The consistency was even watery, gel should not be watery.
"

The cap was off and it leaked in packaging... a gooey mess

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I have very curly and frizzy hair and this is the first product I've tried that controlled the curl but didn't leave my hair crunchy.  I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion to just wrap hair in a towel after applying product  I slept with the towel on overnight to let my hair dry.  I work up with defined curls with a very soft texture.  It controlled about 90% of the frizz and lasted a couple days.

Awesome
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Holds curls well and doesn't feel greasy.  Works best when applied to dripping wet hair.  Drawback is that it doesn't hold for a long time- by the end of the day my curls are pretty lifeless and hair gets a little frizzy.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Great product for the price

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Don't buy! I've used Deva products for over a decade. This stuff is watered down to the point that it runs through your fingers like water.

Great product for curly / wavy hair. Recommended!

Finally, I have found a product that I can control my curls with. No grease, no ""crunchies"", no separation.  Don't need to apply a lot of it either!

I am a curly girl.  I like Deva products.  I use Deva products.  I was pumped when I saw that Arc Angel came in a huge bottle with a pump.Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel, 32-Ounce BottleWhen the bottle arrived at my doorstep, I took everything out of the box, but there was no pump. Please do not add accessories, like a pump, to the picture if that is not what is actually going to be sent.  It is misleading and it made me sad.  Also, the packaging people put a very sticky tape over the top of the cap.  That made me slightly more sad.

I am a woman over 40 with naturally curly, mixed race hair.  I have spent decades trying to find the right mix of products to tame the curls and keep them soft, shiny and frizz free.  This product blows me away.  My curls are beautiful and bouncy all day (and often into the next).  For best results, on humid days, I use the gel liberally and let air dry or diffuse.  Once dry, simply scrunch hair for soft and defined curls.  (I would also recommend using the techniques in the Curly Girl book - you can find here on Amazon).  The gel has a light, fresh scent and can be reactivated later in the day by simply misting with water if needed.My hair has never looked better or been healthier than when I started using this product line.  I will not go back to silicone, paraben or sulfate based products ever.  I highly recommend this to anyone who asks me about what I use on my hair (and I am asked or complimented often).  I can't say enough about this gel...it's amazing.

Good product, but the pump attachment doesn't work. It also arrived with some leakage from the bottle and the plastic wrap was punctured by the tip of the pump, it seemed. So it arrived in a messy condition and is messy to use, but I like the gel itself.

This is a wonderful product when used on your wet hair to give your curly hair an even curlier look which stays looking good for a week! It Is amazing!
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I like this product but thought it would be thicker. It doesn't need to be thicker just thought because it is firm hold it would be thicker. Deva sell 2 other gels ""ultra defining gel"" and ""light defining gel"" both of these are thick gels so they are easier to manage. You can put this gel in fridge to thicken but shouldn't have to do this. So I don't love it but I like it enough to keep buying it.

I like this product it works better than any gel product I've ever used. However, it does leave a sticky residue on my hands. Could be better.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
My stylist recommended this product after I got my first perm.  It's annoying that you have to apply it to wet hair and then let it air dry completely besides giving it a few scrunches with a towel.  My long hair takes so long to dry!  I admit that my waves/curls look nice when I am patient enough to let them air dry 100% but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with medium to long hair.  My stylist said I could try using a diffuser and drying my hair to 80% then letting it air dry the rest of the way but I haven't experimented with that yet.

I had the experience that most of the one star reviewers had. I have been looking for a miracle  hair product to keep my hair in line. I have vey thick very coarse very dry curly/wavy hair. I live in the Pacific north west so I am battling frizz on a near daily basis. This product had so many good reviews I decided to try it ignoring the bad reviews. Well this is what happened:1. My hair felt like I poured glue all over it.2. My hair hadn't felt that dry in years.3. My hair puffed out and looked huge (which is not something that my already enormous hair benefits from) with awful curls that looked like I had a perm.4. I had to wash my hair twice to remove all the product ruining the months it took to normalize the oils in my hair.This product is worse than the really cheap hair products I used years ago. It is NOT worth the money!!!! AVIOD. As a side note I have been trying many hair products as of late and have had the best luck the jane carter products. They make my hair look and feel nice.

I started using this after going to a stylist that was taught to cut curly hair by the creator of the Deva line and I am now a fan. I had always put gel on after getting out of the shower but I was told to lock in the curl its best to apply it while still in the shower and hair is still really wet, I definitely see a big difference and recommend this method.

Product smells so good and does everything it states it will do! So long as you follow the directions and let your hair dry without touching it, my hair has never looked more frizz-free or healthier.

I've alternated back & forth between this gel and the Ultra Defining Gel, and at first when I used this it was way too strong and seemed to way my hair down; HOWEVER, when I recently had a Deva Cut, I tried it again & used a diffuser and it worked way better. My main problem is I have ""Botticelli"" type curls and when my hair gets too long it just goes limp and I wasn't applying it right. I found the best way to use this is too smooth it onto my hair & then scrunch it & then when dry to use a little Argan/Moroccan oil to break the cast. The only thing I will say negative about this is that if your using set it free spray or Mister right it will make your hair wicked sticky so beware, otherwise it's a really great gel with a good hold

After tryng it all (paul mitchel, tigi, moroccan oil, volumax, matrix, fructis, pantene, etc...) I settled with a combination of ouidad climate control gel and deva curl ultra defining gel 50:50 mix and it worked well with my hair which has tight curls.  I keep searching for new products, specially for not having to mix two expensive gels to get the effect I need.  This gel gets the job done.  It provides definition with a little bit of stiffness which is just the right amount.  I love it.  I have even had 3rd day defined curls and I cannot achieve that with any other product. Excellent product.  It works well when applied in very wet hair

I love this brand and especially this gel.  My husband and I both use it, for his super-straight black hair and my curvier grey.  If our hair gets smooshed down by hats during the winter, running wet hands through brings it back to life!

This hair gel is the best I've used.  It is lightweight once it dries - you just have to shake the curls out a little bit and you have smooth curls all day without being too crunchy.  Great product!

I loved this product. I have used it and will continue to use it.  It doesn't make your hair to stiff, but when you put it on wet hair per the directions, your curls set very very well without drying out or feeling too crunchy.  I will be using this product regularly.  I am very pleased.  A little goes a long way!!!

Sulfate and silicone free. Perfect for curly hair. It has a firm hold that will carry over for a second day if desired.  No lingering scent. Washes out of the hair almost completely with only water.  I use No-poo in the shower but sometimes I don't think I need it because I use this gel.

Love this product. After receiving this from this seller, I am convinced that my previous purchase from a different seller was diluted. This one was clearly a much thicker product and worked well.

I have been using this gel for years and it ain't cheap!  Thank goodness Amazon offers the deals the deals that they do so I can get more of them at a time & at a better price. This gel is great since it doesn't dry out my hair, leave it crunchy & it smells awesome to boot.

Squeezing the gel through my wet tresses as my head hung in front of my belly button, I stole a sideways glance into my full length mirror with high hopes for smooth curls.  Wet and gelled they looked perfect and I anticipated lovely, lilting locks when they dried.  Nope, I had a halo of frizz.  Tried it again a the next day and used more product.  Still frizz.  This is not miracle gel.  I got similar-to-better results from a product I bought at the local drug store for half the price.

I initially trialed the Deva Care line at my local Ulta.  I absolutely fell in love with it.  Purchasing on Amazon has always been way more cost effective.  When I received the gel from Amazon it seemed watered down.  Didn't think anything of it but I was using more.  I then purchased the same product from Ulta again and compared.  It was a completely different color and much thicker.  I am pretty sure the one I purchased from Amazon was fake.  Buyer beware

I hated my curly hair when I was younger (who didn't?) but now that I am an adult I have learned to love and embrace what nature gave me. This Gel has transformed my mane!  Before my stylist introduced me to the DevaCurl line, I felt I had two choices: Frizzy hair or hard hair from products claiming to be ""for curly hair.""  The entire DevaCurl line is amazing, I recommend it to anyone with curly hair!The photo of the item showed the pump.  The bottle did NOT come with a pump, just a regular gel-bottle top.  This is disappointing because I specifically ordered from this post because it showed the pump and others did not.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I didn't buy this product from Amazon, I bought from an authorized retailer.DevaCurl is consistently un-impressive to me. I am mixed race with 2c / 3a, medium thickness, normal porosity hair, which is healthy but needs a lot of moisture. This expensive gel is not terrible, but nothing special. It has a lot of hold, but it made my hair more dry and dull, even when combined with leave-in conditioner or cream. It did not help to enhance or define my curls any better than many cheaper products. I usually like to re-wet and detangle my hair in between wash days, and I think this gel makes my hair a lot more tangled and stuck together. Basically it gives me the same results as using a bunch of hair spray.The DevaCurl Ultra Defining gel works better for me, but it's still not amazing for the price. The light defining gel is totally worthless.These products might work for you but if you're thinking of trying them, please don't believe all the hype that they are great for everyone. Try before you buy if you can. Or stick with Shea Moisture, Cantu, Ouidad, Ecoco etc. at the grocery store for 1/2 or 1/3 the price.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I did my first wash and go with this product on New Year’s Eve and now I’m sad because I’m completely HOOKED!! It worked so well with my hair (3B 3C hair) I used Cantu curl activator first in sections, then I applied this Deva curl gel in section (drenched hair). And I absolutely love it!! It smells so good & lasted a long time with no hard crunch. This gel did not fake & my curls lasted a couple days. I’m sure it would’ve lasted longer if I would’ve put it up in a pineapple at night but forgot to. The ONLY downside is the price! My pockets hate to pay for this, hopefully this seller continues to sell it at this price and not continually increase the price.

I have been using Arc Angel for 6 years and LOVE IT because it's perfect for my curls. You'll find reviews here that say it's not good but it's really about what works for your type of curls. Just like the Goldilocks story (different beds are for different bears :) you have to figure out which DevaCurl gel is perfect for your curls. For me, the Ultra Defining Gel was too hard and the Angel, or light defining gel, was too soft and my curls were gone the next day. Arc Angel is just right for me. And I never have a problem with crunchy hair. After it's dry I scrunch it to break the cast. If you are having problems it might be due to the product being old - that's what my world class stylist and DevaCurl Master says.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I've tried so many brands and formulations of hair gels I couldn't remember them if I tried.  DevaCare Arc Angel is different from any ordinary hair gels.  I apply ArcAngel to soaking wet hair, and either air dry, plop, or diffuse.  That's it.  My hair turns out beautifully and my curls last. For second day or third day hair, Arc Angel is easily reactivated with DevaCurl Set It Free or Mist-er Right, and my hair looks freshly styled. Occasionally I try other curl gels or creams, but I always wind up rinsing them out and applying Arc Angel.  My hair just likes it best.  It gives me definition, hold, shine, and moisturization.  Even if dew points are extremely low, this keeps dryness and frizz at bay! The best part about this gel is it never gets crunchy or crispy.  It solidifies, creating a a pliable gel coating that doesn't flake or crack. It ""scrunches out""  extremely easily without causing frizz. I enjoy its mild, citrus scent, too. Arc Angel is a must have for me to feel like my hair looks its best.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Couldn't wait to try this. Glad I got it half price at a beauty supply store, thanks to my son's cosmetologist girlfriend. I bought this with the curl cream. They smell great, but provide zero hold for my 3a to 3B curls. I'll use it when I wear my hair up for work, but for loose styles, I'll stick with my LA looks sport gel for the hold.

DevaCurl saved my life! I always say I'm on a life-long journey for good hair products! I can finally stop looking! My hair is so shiny and healthy and this product doesn't leave my hands sticky! I apply it while my hair is dripping wet and then scrunch my hair with an old tshirt. I've always had to use 3-4 products on my hair at one time but with this I just add a little natural oil after it's dry. I have extremely long hair and surprisingly I didn't have to use half of the bottle on one do! I can't wait to try more products from this line!

Curly hair is gorgeous when styled correctly, a hot mess when no one shows  you how to manage it. Drug store brands leave you flat, crunchy and sticky, and expensive brands leave you disappointed as well. DevaCurl Arc Angel is EXTRAORDINARY! Flip your head, put in as much as you like, squeeze with a paper towel and either air dry or use a diffuser with your head upside down, and voila! Gorgeous, bouncy, defined curls.THANK YOU ARC ANGEL!(Tip: it never gets crunchy because it's all natural. I have long hair so I use more. For the paper towel part, I stack 2 and re-use 2 or 3 times before tossing. I keep a paper towel roll under the sink to keep things simple. I also keep a few paper towel sheets in my luggage for travel.)

I've been using deva products for over 10 years and I love it. But this gel stays hard when your hair is dry. I use it when I pull my hair back or wear it up and want it to hold but not when I wear my hair down.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I started using DevaCurl products a few months ago, and my hair has never looked better.  After I wash, condition, and comb my hair with a wide-tooth comb, I use a cotton t-shirt to remove excess moisture.  Then I flip my hair over (upside-down) and apply Arc Angel, scrunching it from ends to roots.  It takes a small amount, as this is a firm-hold gel.  Then, I plop my hair.  (You can look up videos to show you how to do this.  It's a way to wrap your hair and let it dry without stretching out your curl.)  When I take it down, I have thick strands of beautiful curls that hold their shape all day.  The best part is that it doesn't leave your hair stiff and sticky, and like all DevaCurl products, it smells great!

The item came and was exactly as described.  It was shipped in a timely manner.  I saved $10 by buying my hairspray and gel through Amazon rather than using my local salon to purchase.  With my Amazon prime account, I don't pay shipping so win, win.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I chose to use the ArcAngell over Angell due to the porosity of my hair. ArcAngell provides my hair with additional moisture while still helping to maintain my curl. Unlike drug store hair gels intended for curly hair, I do not end up with crinkle curls or hard like glue curls. My hair is not sticky or gross after using this product.

I have very thick African American hair, mostly a mix of 3a-4a curls. I've had this gel for over two months now, so I'm going to give the results of my experiements.The included image is of my hair only minutes after washing it. In my hair I have a diluted mix of DevaCurl One Condition Decadence, Mist-er Right, Supercream and Arc Angel gel. The makn ingredient that is causing my hair to clump is the gel, which I typically use right after washing to avoid shrunken-up, frizzy hair, to replenish moisture, and add shine.In my opinion, this product works best to define your own natural curl pattern, as opposed being used to help set a twist-out- bantu knot-out, braid-out, ect. It is very thick and has an amazing citrus scent, which I love. A lot of Black naturals aren't used to the concept of sparringly anymore because our hair is so thick, but when I say use this sparringly I mean sparringly! You only need a small, finger-tip sized amount per section. This product cannot be used interchangably like eco-styler gel where you just plop on as much as possible. It works best with other stylers, especially with DevaCurl Supercream.The majority of the problems I see when Black women are using DevaCurl products is that they are attempting to use them individually as opposed to with several other DevaCurl products because the products are expensive and they don't want to shell out all that money. This is a huge mistake that will no doubt leave you disappointed.In order to achieve perfect, long-lasting, frizz free definition with DevaCurl products on thick, natural Afro-textured hair YOU HAVE TO USE SEVERAL DEVA CURL PRODUCTS AT ONCE.Here is my DevaCurl routine. I use it to define my own natural curls and for twst outs but mostly bantu knots, so here it is:1. Moisten a small to medium section of hair with One Condition Decadence diluted with water. This adds moisture and deifnion. We're going to layer the products until we recieve the definition and moisture we want.1. Spritz with Mist-er Right. This spray really adds moisure you can feel and helps my curls spring and pop.2. Take a fingertip sized amount of SuperCream and add two to three drops of MirrorCurls. The MirrorCurls really adds fantastic, glossy shine without leaving my hair feeling greasy or oily. I love shiny, glossy hair so this leaves me feeling satisfied. Keep in mind that this product has both the scent and texture of castor oil which many other reviewers have found  unpleasant.3. Add a fingertip sized amount of ArcAngel Gel. This adds both slip and a touch of hold. I much prefer the Beautiful Mess pomade for hold, but I like to layer the two. For some reason the Beautiful Mess pomade seems to ""melt"" or ""dissolve"" upon contact with soaking wet hair, making it fairly useless when styling straight out of the shower.4. Add a fingertipped sized amount of Beautiful Mess pomade. This is my holy grail product. It shapes and molds my curls with no crunch, no flakes, no white residue, and no stiffness. The reult is always perfect, glossy curls with frizz-free definition that seperate like butter.5. Allow your hair to dry for as long as possible. I do my hair early in the morning on my days off to ensure proper drying time.

I have been wanting to write a review for months because this product was a fake...or more likely the real thing but really watered down.  I have been using the arc angel gel for many years and this one was a MUCH more liquidy consistency.  I mixed it with the new Deva Ultra Defining gel which I'd recently bought from a salon and had found too thick and that seemed to do the trick.  But now that i've finished the bottle I won't ever buy it again on Amazon or at least not from the seller ""The Best Deals in the USA""

When i first started my curly hair journey, this gel was great for me. I used it for 2 years. But as my hair got healthier and more curI, i began to notice it was actually weighing down my 2c curls. But the ultra defining gel wasnt enough hold.. And that also felt heavy! I  so I tried Kinky Curly Curling Custard, a few shea moisture gel creams, and noticed in comparison my hair felt light and my curls had way more body. Kept their shape too! The deva gels arent bad but through trying other products ive learned it is definitely not the best curl sculpting product out there.  Also not a good choice for humid days. Ive seen that true for multiple curl types!!

I have been a loyal Deva Curl client for five years! I loved their products, techniques, and even get the DevaCut. I used to love how my hair looked and felt with the products. Even when the change of ownership came and their products started to get marked up, I figured it’s still worth it. Then, for the past few months especially, I’ve noticed changes in my hair and scalp. I had been using the same products for years, no-poo shampoo, one condition, styling cream, believe-in, and ultra defining gel or the arc-angel gel. However, my scalp became itchier and itchier, dryer and dryer, and now I have dandruff I can’t get rid of. What’s worse, is my hair! It became dryer and coarser. The worse it got the more products I used and the more I washed it. I tried different techniques and brushing it differently. Always slept with a silk pillowcase AND silk bonnet. Then I figured I should get DevaCurl’s Melt Into Moisture Conditioning Mask. It just made things worse. My hair shed to new extremes, making my hair look flat and thin, my scalp got worse with dry patches that felt tight and hard. My hair was so dry and coarse even after washing my hair, at the end of the day it was matted. Keep in mind I have 3A/B curls, it takes quite a bit to have it matted. not tangled, MATTED. Which of corse meant I had to wash it more, and brushing through it made it fall out more! My curls werent taking shape like they used to. My curls looked more like matted, dry, haystacks that slightly waved. My scalp became sensitive to brushing, it was a nightmare! I stopped using DevaCurl in just a week and I’ve noticed a huge difference already. My curls haven’t fully recovered, but I’m hopeful they will. I will not buy DevaCurl again unless they address this and change to fix the issue. So disappointed, five years of spending money one overpriced products and this is how they repay me. I honestly just want them to go back to how they used to be.

I did not like this gel at all and since it was my 1st time using it, I thought I should try a different gel.  I ordered the Light Defining gel directly from the manufacturer and received a sample of the Arc Angel gel.  I decided to try it on a day I would be spending outside in heat and humidity. The sample was an orangish color & worked amazing whereas the product purchases her was clear and worked like a cheap dollar store gel.  So tired of fake products on Amazon. Don't buy this product here,  it's fake.

 I have used a huge number of gels and hair products for curly hair. I was going. To order another bottle of ouidad and saw reviews for this arc angel gel. So I ordered two 32 oz bottles just Incase I like it. Well it controls my curly hair. I use three pumps for my hair and that’s more than enough. And it should last me quit awhile. The scent is fresh and for a guy works great with my echo  Cologne.So tried more pumps 4-5 now and works even better.

I LOVE DevaCurl! These products have changed my life. I feel so much more confident and myself now that I have help styling and maintaining my curls. I discovered Deva almost a decade ago and rarely use any other product. When I have, I immediately notice the difference. No other gel I have tried is quite like Deva - which NEVER leaves my hair crunchy or greasy. I recommend Deva to every curly girl who has ever complimented my hair - from close family to complete strangers. The Arc Angel is a stronger hold; if you have wavy hair, try the light hold.Amazon often has lower prices than I can get at local beauty stores but I have occasionally had the bottles leak a bit on shipping.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I am not sure if what I purchased was a fake (the smell was righ but the color was off)) or if it was perhaps expired, all I know is this product did not work the way I have found it to when I have purchased it from Ulta or Sephora.  Normally I can scrunch this in leave my hair to air dry and then break the ""cast"" and have the softest most durable curls that last till my next shampooing. This left my hair oily and lifeless and not at all nice to touch. Highly recommend that you save the $$ and buy it from a licensed salon or distributor.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
In my opinion, this is either not the real product or it’s watered down. I compared it to my current product, purchased at Ulta. It smells the same and has pretty much the same consistency. However, the “stickiness” is totally off. Therefore, the way it holds my curls doesn’t work even close to what I purchased at Ulta. It does work just not even close to as well as the product I purchased at Ulta. If you’re not familiar with the original product, you may like it. But, seriously, what I purchased at Ulta is 100% better. As far as I’m concerned, even though it’s cheaper, it’s not a good buy.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I'm not even sure if this gel came from Devacurl.  I have their other products and this was totally different.  first off it watery. non of their gels are like that.  It is similar to the cheap stuff from walmart like LA looks or something. it makes your hands feel gross when you go to scrunch your dry hair, DEF not a a devacurl thing. doesnt hold and arcangel is the strongest gel in the line, over this is trash DO NOT BUY. BUY devaCURL arc angel NOT devaCARE

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
This was my first time buying deva curl products. Someone told me they have a lot of protein, not sure how true that is. I have low porosity 3C hair and this was a little drying for my hair. I wouldnt spend this much money again, I bought some samples of the supercream and Im going to mix them together and see how my wash n go comes out after that. So far though, I've tried 3 deva curl products and im not really impressed, especially since theyre expensive. wont be repurchasing, because it doesnt give me the moisture and hold that I need, though it does do a great job with definition like all of their other products, I will however finish the bottle.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
This product has an absurd amount of water in it. I was very hopeful about this gel, as it was recommended by others... however, you're paying a silly amount of money for a liter of water. I suppose if you put this in a bottle and diluted 1:1 it might be alright to spray in, if your hair is okay with being sprayed. But, otherwise, this is just a fair waste of money.
"
"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
I've read the reviews that said it wasn't. I've read a lot of bad reviews about great things. I received ArcAngel. It smells the same, it feels the same, it works the same. All soft and not drying. I can manipulate control after air drying the same. Maybe certain people aren't getting the real thing but I did. The same goes for the One Condition, No Poo, and SuperCream I ordered. All perfect Deva products 💗💗💗

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
This stuff works. I admit I was skeptical, but I am sold. it does not flake after my hair is dry and the hold is firm but not stiff. i use this when I am wearing my hair curly and also when i am wearing it straight to keep it straight. I have lots of compliments on the smell. It washes out very easily with water. You only need to use a small amount so this bottle will last for a long time and it well worth the price.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
The scent is nice but I have to use twice as much to get the same affect as the Ultra Defining gel.  My hair is frizzy and the curls aren’t very well defined using this gel.  I’ve been using DevaCurl for years and only bought the Arc Angel because the Ultra Defining wasn’t available.  I won’t buy this again even if it means switching to another brand.

For almost 10 years I used Graham Webb Making Waves Curl Defining Gel and it was amazing. The company no longer exists so I had to find a new gel. It was so hard to find something to replace what I loved for so long!After trying countless gels from the store, I tried this one based on reviews. I am not sure it's 100% as good as what I used before, but it's good enough!This is my routine and it works great for me: In the shower, I scrunch my hair a couple times with my hands to get most of the water out and put a towel over my hair to dry my hair more. After a couple minutes, I take my towel off and apply gel to my hair upside down. I then scrunch my hair with a dry piece of a paper towel. I then repeat and add more gel, dry with another dry paper towel and do it one more time. After that, I spray my hair with KMS Curl Up Spray.I have found that this gel works great at getting those spirally curls and does not leave your hair looking stiff or crunchy.Definitely recommend!

I tried liking this stuff. I really wanted to. After reading reviews I thought I'd try. I have thick curly hair but this stuff just adds too much texture. It controls frizz wonderfully but my hair tangles so easily when using this product. Then when I go to wash and condition it just feels like straw. I'm not a fan. LUS works so much better for my hair.

I've used this product for years and loved and ordered it from this dealer several times. The dealer is always on time and I've never had a problem with them. The product on the other hand use to be amazing and I swore by it. I believe they have changed their formula because no matter where I buy this, it dries and damages my hair. This makes my hair hard to manage. I do not recommend this product.

The best product I’ve used so far.  I have had more compliments on my hair since switching to this Arc Angel gel then ever in my life.  Several people have bought it because they liked my hair so much.  Complete strangers will come up to me.  In my opinion it is the perfect balance of crunch and softness to my curls.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
Weird, watery, didn't feel like the real deal at all, though it does smell like it. When you get real deva curl product, as I have in the past, IT WORKS. This does not.  First time I used a regular amount. Curls were puffy and not defined at all.  Second time I really slathered it on and it just left my hair, dull, feeling coated in too much product but not shiny, or smooth and my curls were frizzy once they dried. A 32oz bottle for $25 sounds too good to be true because it is. I will be returning this fake bull-crap right away. Thanks for nothing, Amazon.

I bought the No Poo, DevaCare One condition and the DevaCurl Deva Care Arc Angell. This line of product definitely makes my curls look gorgeous! They're more defined and my husband constantly tells me it looks sexy haha I get compliments from people often! My only gripe is that I believed all frizz would be eliminated but I still have quite a bit of frizz. I use the right type of dryer too (which I don't use every single time). I'm hoping the frizz is only happening because I've only been using this stuff for 2 1/2 weeks and I know it takes up to 6 weeks to see a total transformation. I'm a fan of the shampoo and gel smell but I do not like the smell of the conditioner. It reminds me of my grandma's Dove soap lol  All that aside, I will continue to purchase these hair products and I'll update my review after 6 weeks! :)

I've tried so many gels for my thick frizzy curls. I found these particular DevaCurl gel to work best for me. It still wasn't however enough to tame my wild fly-aways so I'm still dialing down which combo of product to keep my curls nice for many days before resuming another co-wash.

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
i didnt think this product would be any big deal, but I am amazed really. When you apply it , it is like it disappears into your hair, not slimy...nothing..in fact the first couple times i put on more because i just thought it wasnt enough! But, after a few uses I put on less and less and this just is wonderful on my hair. My hair is VERY fine and VERY curly (naturally) so the back tends to really kink up and even gets frizzy. I was so frustrated not being able to find anything. This defines the curls and does not gunk up my hair..fabulous!

"DevaCurl Arc Angel Control Styling Gel, 32oz","
This product doesn't really do the job. I have pretty fine, shoulder-length hair, and it's pretty curly (not too kinky/tight, but definitely more than wavy). I've been in a never-ending search for the right styling product ever since Graham Webb Making Waves gel was discontinued. Several of my curly-haired friends swear by Deva, so I tried this firm hold gel - my only reservation was that the firm hold might be too crunchy. And just the opposite occurred. It has ZERO hold and my hair is as frizzy as if it had no product in it. The feel was nice in my hand, and it smelled good, but it's just not doing the job.

This product is fake or at least past its date.  It doesn't work; doesn't create a cast in the slightest and reminded me of ""soft as jelly curls"" from Miss Jessie's rather than any of the DevaCurl gels.

I have been using this product off and on for years, but now I really NEED it.  In my teens I had wild and crazy frizzy curly hair, very hard to manage.  I went to a natural 'wash and wear' haircut and that helped a lot.  But during the summer months or on humid days, it could still get pretty wild.  I found this product (at the time called ""set up and above"") and it helped make my hair more manageable.  After 40, I completely lost the frizz, but also have gone thru periods where I completely lost my curl as well, although after a time it has always come back.  Well, not this time.  No curl to be found.  This product works in a different way for me now.  Instead of taming my hair, it makes it a ""beautiful mess""  and people can't tell I no longer have any natural curl.  I still have a natural cut, so after washing I rub a dab or two between my palms, and just mess up my hair to produce beautiful curls and waves and let it air dry.  Lightweight, non-sticky gel that works like a charm.  I have tried others, some okay, others not so much.  No more fooling around...this is the one for me!

I’m really disappointed in this product. I’ve been using Deva Curl Set up and above (which is the old product for this product) for about two years now. It took me a LONG time to find the right product for my curls. This product helped me perfect my curls every time! The new product “Beautiful Mess” is supposed to be the same, but it definitely is not. It’s not as thick as Set up and above, so it doesn’t hold my curls as well. On a positive note the new product smells a lot better. I just wish they didn’t change the ingredients...now I’m going to have to find a new product to perfect my curls :-(

Pulls my curls apart, does not add texture. Super sticky so when I try to define a curl, no matter how little I use, it glues my strands together and makes it pin straight.  Followed all the videos on line and used as directed but no luck with this product

While I normally love my Devs product, this is one I should've passed on.Made my scalp very dry & flaky.
"
"DevaCurl Beautiful Mess Curl Sculpting Pomade, 3.8oz","
I bought this product because Deva Curl sent me an email advertising their products that were supposed to help control frizziness. It did NOT control my frizziness - it made my hair feel stiff and like straw. The jar says use a small amount. I tried a small amount and ramped it up, but the end result was always the same. Plus, I could not get it to wash out of my hair except by using a clarifying shampoo. I have been a faithful user of Deva Curl products and always been happy, but this is the worst product I have ever used on my hair. I contacted Deva Curl to find out if I was using the product correctly, but they were completely unresponsive to addressing the problems I was having and wouldn't let me return the product. I am totally disappointed in this product and with Deval Curl customer service!

Love this! Great on wet or dry hair for curl definition and frizz-fighting. Doesn’t make my hair crunchy. It’s a solid, so no spilling - perfect for travel. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin either.Have been getting so many more compliments on my hair since I’ve started using this regularly.

I have super, super thick 3a African American hair. EcoStyler gel does an okay job at laying down my hair for buns and ponytails, but I always hated how hard and crusty it made my hair. Eco Styler gel also makes my hair take forever to dry, not to mention is causes serious flakes and build up and doesn't play well with other products. One day I attempted to moisturize my hair with diluted conditioner with it still in my hair, and it caused these little rubbery balls to form!This stuff works! It instantly slicks down my hair without any of the flakes and super long drying time. Best of all it still leaves my hair soft and touchable, not hard and moulded in place like other products I've tried- and it gives AMAZING definition. Detangling is a breeze because of the slip this product gives, and my bantu knots are always perfectly curly and defined with no frizz.It almost molds your hair in place, but unlike other pomades that leave your hair looking stringy and ""feeling"" molded, this pomade seems to almost ""melt. So when you're doing your twist-outs, bantu knot-outs, braid-outs, ect, your hair may feel a bit stiff and look a bit stringy- but don't be alarmed! It won't look that way when you take it down.This stuff is amazing and works incredibly for my hair type. It also leaves my hair shiny and glossy. I will now consider this a must-have hair product. If you have thick hair that loves heavy products such as grease, pomades, or butters your hair will LOVE this product. If you have thin, fine, or wavy hair I would not recommend this product, as it will more than likely weigh your hair down and cause it to feel heavy and greasy.

Love this product! Controls my frizz very well while leaving my curls intact. Some reviewers say they found it to leave their hair crunchy, however I haven't noticed that to be the case for me. My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to work on wet hair (for me anyway) but works awesome on dry hair. Smells great and a little goes a long way!

Watching Queer Eye has made me want to get some pomade for my hair for forever now. The hair salon I go to uses Deva Curl products, and I have been very satisfied with all the products they use. This pomade is really easy to use, smells nice, and doesn't make your hair feel dry and gross like hair spray or gel does. I usually don't use product for my curls, but this is so much fun to use. Just putting some in my hair makes me feel a little more confident.

I use this on days when my wavy,curly hair is not cooperating. It molds flyaways into nicely placed curls and waves!

"DevaCurl Beautiful Mess Curl Sculpting Pomade, 3.8oz","
This absolutely was the worst smelling stuff ever! Looked like petroleum jelly mixed with an extremely small amount of the real product in it. It was thick like petroleum jelly & the stuff from the salon is clear with a beautiful scent and has a silky feeling on hair & skin. This again felt like globbing on Vaseline! I would not recommend buying from this seller!

Did not work at all! It was like a clump that was greasy/wet looking and was pin straight and would not twist or curl. The cream itself was hard... almost like frozen jello...

Perfect for styling finer curls. Different from other pomades; not heavy or greasy at all, no “wet curls” look. Can be used on both wet and dry hair.

I like the beautiful mess product, but can't give it 5 stars because i don't love it.  It doesn't make my hair curly and pretty the same way that the Deva Ultra Defining Gel or the Mop Top does.  I will use it more, but will probably find it more of use after the humid summer is over.  I would recommend this product, but it doesn't give me the look i am looking for.
"

I use DevaCurl products exclusively and I love the line and the philosophy so I had great hope for this product,  but it just didn't work for my hair.  My curls are very fine and my hair is on the thin side and this was just too sticky and hard to apply.  I ended up giving it to a friend whose hair is wavy...

Deva Curl is legit. I don't care what anyone says... BUT you can't give a real review without the whole picture and relevant information. Here is my whole picture:Half Asian, half African American with - I don't know- 2B type curls? I have blonde highlights, fairly long hair, and I use a curling iron A LOT to straighten my hair.I live deep in the Gulf Coast. That means humidity is 80% on a GOOD day.  On a bad day in mid July? 100% easy. This means I can spend 45 minutes doing my hair in the morning, and the walk from my front door to the car will totally null any and all attempts to look cute for the day.I've tried EVERYTHING in my attempts to achieve manageable hair.  From high end to drug store. I've taken breaks from Deva Curl and tried to use other things for a month or so. My hair just can't take it. I've also tried the Low Poo and the Decadence versions. Nope. One makes my hair feel dry and rough and the other makes it a heavy and greasy.Whether I wear my hair straight or curly, No Poo and One Condition ALWAYS give me the best results. It calms my dry, frizzy locks and makes it soft, healthy looking, and manageable. But I also use a very good , inexpensive and natural styling product to get this.The type of hair you have and the type of climate you live in are all going to be big factors on whether or not this product will work for you, so for a lot of reviewers to just to throw out there ""Not worth it"" or ""Doesn't work"" is not a fair or informed review when it comes to hair products.

DevaCurl DECADENCE No-Poo & One Condition DUO Set,"
My hair is soft, silky, thin, dry, frizzy/curly and fine and it is a challenge to find products that work well on this unfortunate combination of characteristics.  If I apply a product that keeps it clean and oil-free, it gets fried, dried, and damaged.  If I apply a product that gives it the moisture and conditioning it needs, it gets oily, flat, and weighed down.At first, I tried the original Deva No Poo products and they were great at first, but with time my hair started to look greasy and flat.  So I switched to the Low Poo and light conditioner and it is perfect!  I don't use the Low Poo every day, but I can apply the conditioner in my daily shower to keep my hair in good shape and always looking clean and conditioned.  My hair is not really very curly, but it defines my gentle waves and makes them  pretty instead of scary.I like this set because I'm not always running out of it and I don't have to order so often.  But when I run out, I'll probably re-order.

As a curly hair individual, I try to use the best products  for my hair.  I've tried a bunch of other products and as a cleanser and conditioner, these two for me are the best.  I have a 3C and 4A mix curly hair and this cleans and conditions the best without my hair getting hard and staying moisturized.  I use it weekly, with sometimes just co-washing with the conditioner alone.  For me it has a mild sent, so it's not uncomfortable.  Also, I have sensitive skin and it doesn't give me allergies.  Its a product I buy on the regular and I would 100% recommend it.

I have been using the Wavy hair products from Devacurl for a couple of years so I'm familiar it. The shampoo is supposed to be a sort of gelatinous, more viscous consistency and the shampoo is like WATER!!! I have to use so many more pumps than normal, it's ridiculous!!! I know my product and this is not it. Not only will I never buy from this seller again, but I'm buying it from Devacurl's website.

"
DevaCurl DECADENCE No-Poo & One Condition DUO Set,"
I'm mystified why so many others seem to get great results from these products and my results are like the ""before"" parts of positive reviews. I've tried many products for curly hair but always have trouble with frizz, so I decided to try this line because DevaCurl actually has products just for wavy hair. As most people know, there is a big difference between wavy and curly hair and what products work on both. So, my hair is 2b/2c, but with the right product can be a 3a curl pattern. After using these two on my hair, my hair was more like a combination of poofy 2a and a little 2b, poofy/fluffy without much wave. I felt like I was back in the 80s. I want my waves curlier, not almost straight. My hair was soft, but who cares when it's poofy? I couldn't care less about great ""slip"" when the end results are that I look like a poodle who has just had a bath and been blow dried. Worst of all is how much my scalp itched after using these products. My head hasn't itched this bad in years, it's like when I used to use products full of sulfates because I didn't know anything about them.  I am leaving my review here because I noticed all the reviews on the DevaCurl site are positive and I find that very suspicious. I do not recommend these at all.
"
DevaCurl DECADENCE No-Poo & One Condition DUO Set,"
I love this product but it took 11 days to come. The packaging is shoddy with only a piece of scotch across the top and wrapped in plastic. A lot of the product oozed out of the packaging making it a mess when I opened it. It came with a compact mirror in a box that resembled wet gooey paper mache.  It was also left to sit and cook in my mailbox. I would suggest getting this from your salon where you will not lose some of the expensive product and it will be climate controlled.
"
DevaCurl DECADENCE No-Poo & One Condition DUO Set,"
I love this product! My hair had been dry and coarse my who'll me life, even as a teenager, when most kids struggle with greasy hair. Since I've been using this (about a year), it feels much softer, even the grays, and doesn't immediately puff up in humidity. I wish I had found out about this years ago!I had read some reviews saying they got counerfeit deva curl products through Amazon, but I just ordered the prime eligible one, and didn't choose the absolute cheapest seller. Mine were legit.

Devacurl used to be a great product, and since Lorraine left the company in 2013 the quality has gone drastically downhill to the point where after this purchase I am done with the entire line. The no-poo's and conditioners offer absolutely NO slip anymore, and leave so much residue on my hair that it barely curls. For this kind of money I expect a lot more than what this product is currently offering. If for some reason you're still holding onto the dying embers of this brand, take my advice and just let it go. There are better products out there that don't cost even a quarter of what this overpriced crap does. MopTop is excellent quality for a very reasonable price.

DevaCurl DECADENCE No-Poo & One Condition DUO Set,"
I was introduced to DevaCurl at my salon and bought more through Amazon. I'm pushing 70 and found my formerly smooth curls and waves became frizz monsters when my hair turned grey. The DevaCurl products have helped me tame my mane to the point where I can wear my hair down in Florida without looking like Phyllis Diller.  I still blow dry it and occasionally use a flat iron rather than let it go natural, but my hair feels and looks so much better with these products!
"
DevaCurl DECADENCE No-Poo & One Condition DUO Set,"
This is a gift for my granddaughter and having used this brand myself previously I will say the best price is through Amazon. The pump makes it easy to use in the shower and the product is absolutely wonderful. She has very thick hair and this works so well for her and will last a long time. Has a nice rich texture to both the shampoo and conditioner and does not leave any build up residue which is what she likes. She will only use this brand and this particular one with the ""milk"" infused. Great Product, costly but works well. She loves the light scent as well as I did.

Makes your hair soft
"
DevaCurl DECADENCE No-Poo & One Condition DUO Set,"
I absolutely love this stuff and can't say enough about it.  My hair is softer and forming better curls and ringlets than it has before. (Before this, my hair mostly ranked 2C/3A, but now I would classify it a 3A/3B.)  I bought this 6 months ago and have just ran out; for how long it lasts, the price works itself out!  The odor is a little strong, but doesn't last after the hair has dried.
"
DevaCurl DECADENCE No-Poo & One Condition DUO Set,"
Do not use if you're allergic to perfumes or are sensitive to it! Stuff worked great but my eyes were burning and instant headache. The strong Cool Water smell was very disappointing for such a supposed high quality product.

Fake product! I’ve been using DevaCurl products for four years now, and this bottle of fake product nearly ruined my hair. The ingredients aren’t the same as a true DevaCurl Mist-er Right spray I purchased last week at my regular salon. For the last two months or so (since I’ve been using the Amazon purchased bottle) my hair has been so dry it feels like a hay bale. My curls were frizzy and flat, and since I’ve stopped using the fake product my hair has gone back to normal with some extra TLC.

DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I just received DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher last week. I have always loved DevaCurl products and was excited to try this. But, it simply smells putrid. I feel like some animal has climbed up into my hair and died.... and then rotted. I read the reviews, before purchase, and saw they were mixed. But, the folks who liked it seemed to really like it. So, I gave it a shot - twice. My hair does feel a little softer. But, it is not worth the odor. I plan to return it. I gave it one star because zero was not an option AND my hair does feel a little better.

This is my second bottle and it doesn't smell as good as the first one, which was lavender scented. This smells like chemical hair product. And it doesn't do as good a job of refreshing my limp curls as the original. The formula change was not a good one.

This has been the best product for second day curls/waves. My hair is naturally wavy and I've been wearing it straight all my life and am only just now learning how to coax my pretty waves back to life and health. I've even used this to revive my hair on the third day too.  I just spritz all over l, then I flip my head over to spray underneath, flip head back to normal position, scrunch my hair all over to encourage curls and let it air dry! So simple.

This smells bad like fish oil. It’s a light smell but obviously I don’t want to smell like that. I have never used this product before so I’m not sure if it’s fake or maybe just really old. I doubt the product is suppose to smell like fish oil though.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
When you have curly hair, no amount of product put in while wet keeps it looking as fresh the next day. I use to over load my hair with a plethora of products which only weighed it down or made it hard, but this stuff is amazing. You won’t be disappointed in this product!
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
My curly hair has never looked better than when I started using DevaCurl products.  DevaCurl Mist-er Curl Refresher really refreshes your hair's curl on the 2nd, 3rd & even 4th day. No more bed head and loss of curls after a nights sleep.  Of all the hair products for curls I've used this is the brand that delivers.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This isn't a diss to the seller, this is about the product itself. It came on time and undamaged from the seller, no leaks or anything which is most appreciated.  As for the product itself, it was a bit expensive  (same price in stores) but I think , instead of actually refreshing my curls, it made them almost crispy where scrunching the crunch did not help. It also made my scalp itch terribly, even when I tried not to get any of it on my scalp. The build up felt bad. By the end of the day, my curls looked limped and greasy, even using a little. I like the smell though, but devacurl could have created something better and less heavy. Mist-er Right is not right for me.

I have thick, curly, coarse hair. This product did not refresh my curls when I applied it to my dry hair. It seemed to provide some defining qualities if I used it right after washing and applying smoothing product. I would not purchase this again.

"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because this is a little bit expensive I feel for hair product, but after using it I was amazed. Not used to  something without wetting my hair first or combing it in, but I went right by the directions and was surprised how it revived my frizzed out curly lifeless hair. Today was my second day using it and I am glad I found and purchased this.  It also leaves my hair tangle free which is always an issue.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I use this spray on my first-day curls that have a bit of frizz but mostly on my second-day curls that need revitalizing. I also use it on my 5 year old's hair to bring back the bounce of her curls in between washes. The scent is quite pleasing and there's no sticky-ness or crunch to the curls.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I really like how the product does revitalize my waves nicely. However, I cannot get past the strong scent! Smells almost medicinal which is very disappointing! I find it interesting per all the reviews people really Love the scent, or can't stand it! lol... I may not be able to get past the scent but love what it does for my curls! I give a definite thumbs up!
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I really wish I hadn't believed the reviews, many of which I'm guessing aren't real. I've tried a million sprays like this and this one is exactly the same - creates kind of a stiff film on top but does not add curl, refresh, minimize frizz or make my hair/scalp feel cleaner in any way. I'm still on the hunt. So far, nothing works better than plain water.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This does help my curls if they're getting flat after a few days, but it leaves your hair kind of sticky so beware. The smell is pretty strong lavender. I would use this on the last day before washing.

DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I just received and haven't used yet, so can't vouch for how well it works, but wow, it smells awful. Like a chemical cleaning product. I ignored previous commenters complaints about smell and thought I'd give it a try, but phew, I don't think I'm going to use this.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I have been using Mist-er Right forever. This last bottle I received the spray is thicker and sticky and keeps clogging the spray nozzle. It also smells different (not as good).  Not a fan. I have been slowing replacing all my Deva products lately as  they all seem to have changed for the worse.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
When I received this product the packaging was soaking wet & the bottle was half full. I thought this product would follow its description, & refresh my curls yet it did the opposite. It made my hair extremely frizzy & smells like chemicals & lavender. Really disappointed in this product.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I really like the DevaCurl products. I have natural curly hair. These products work well for me. I will NEVER order them through Amazon again. They came in ripped packaging. Missing products. Leaking products. It is a mess. Amazon Customer Service used to be the best. No longer. DevaCurl should reconsider making their products available through Amazon. Bad experience will keep away customers.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This product didn't meet my expectations at all. I tried it a few times. I could get over the potent sent if my hair looked great/felt great. The deal breaker is the texture. My thin curly hair felt as though it had been fried when I used this product. This product also caused a ton of frizz. Keep looking for another product.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I love this product, it is the best solution to freshen up your hair on the non-wash days without weighing it down with a lot of product.  Also great for adding a bit of moisture to combat frizz throughout the day.  This is my new secret weapon to keeping my hair looking great.

This is my ultimate favorite curl refresher. I have been using it for years!  It has a great smell so it’s always wonderful on the day you don’t wash your curls. It’s not heavy so it doesn’t weigh them down. I even use them if I diffuse a curl and it gets frizzy
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
It’s just ok. You have to use a TON in order to get the revitalized curls your working for. If you have wavy hair, this product will be great. Super long curls, not so good. If rather wet my hair than use half the bottle trying to get my curls right.
"

"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
One of my all time favorite curly hair products. Great in between washings and a way to reactivate your curl.  I usually dampen my hair first with water, apply product and scrunch. Gives definition and a little structure.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This product isn't whay it's cracked up to be. It's water, lavender and minimal non frizz stuff for curls. I find that my own water bottle spritzer with lavender and a little frizz oil,  does the same if not better to refresh my curls.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This is to be used on dry hair and it does a great job.  Works best on hair that has been washed a day or two before use.  I find it isn't as effective on hair which has product buildup.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This spray definitely brings life and bounce back to my hair in the mornings. My only complaint is that it seems to add frizz and my hair feels a bit dry after I use it. I pair it with a leave in conditioner and that helps a lot.

This product doesn't refresh my curls. It leaves my hair sticky when you apply it and then rough. I get better results when I spray my hair with water as opposed to using this product. It doesn't work and definitely not worth the money.

I purchased this for my curly extension (human hair) at the recommendation of a coworker and stylist.  My hair was still frizzy and the product smells funny.  Perhaps it's better for short, curly hair, but it did nothing for my long curls.  I did better with a $5 bottle of mousse from Walgreens.  I would not purchase again.

I use DevaCurl AnGel after washing my hair and let it air dry, then Mist-er Right to refresh each day till the next wash. There's nothing better! My hair is naturally curly, but gets very wavy after sleeping on it. A spray of Mist-er Right with scrunching and the curls are back perfectly when it dries. It feels a little sticky on my hands when damp, but that disappears when it dries and my hair is soft and touchable.My hair is thick, not coarse, there's just a lot of it, but I know others with thin curly hair who also love this product. A water spray will not bring the curl back to my hair like the Mist-er Right. Water just accentuates the waves. The strong lavender odor disipates as the product dries leaving my hair with a nice clean smell that doesn't fight with my perfume.DevaCurl AnGell Conditioning Gel - 32 OzDeva Curl Mist, Er Right, 12 oz

This truly refreshes my curls, makes my hair smell great and does its job. The issue I have with it is the residue I feel like it leaves on my hair. The no poo method it’s meant to accompany doesn’t seem to take it off. I think I’m gonna have to use regular shampoo.

I’m not sure if this is a real Devacurl product; but it doesn’t do what it says. You are supposed to apply it to your hair dry to refresh it but it doesn’t do much.

DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Before this I would use shea moisture shampoo, conditioner and curl cream and wash every 2-3 days and it stayed soft and somewhat manageable. By day 3 it starts to get frizzy and a little out of control.Just used this on my hair *dry* as instructed on day 3 because I needed something to zap some moisture back in to lengthen time between washes.It completely dried out my hair and made it much much MUCH more frizzier. I have a mix of 3b,c and kinky 4a hair. I'm worried it's damaged now.I followed instructions and am disappointed because this is my first devacurl product I've used.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I am always hesitant with this brand because I feel like I either hate it or love it. This one, I can’t live without!! I don’t wash my curls everyday, this spray wakes them up in the mornings! It’s absolutely amazing!  Works best if you spray a tiny smidge of water on your dry hair before using and less is more!
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This stuff is like crack for curls! However the scent is not pleasant at all. That’s the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Since I started using it, my hair has gotten dryer and frizzier.  I bought it hoping it will refresh my curls the next day, but it doesn't.  You have to add a lot of product to get your curls back and it smells very strong.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This didn't do a lot to help my hair on second or third day.  It left it feeling dry and it didn't re-curl as much as i would like. I also am not a fan of the strong lavender smell.  :(
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
It definitely refreshes my curls the next day and I love, so far, how it makes my hair look. Smells terrible . Unsure of where the lavender is .. all the other Devacurl products smell amazing . Bought a large bottle and will just deal with the smell because I like what it does for my hair 🤷🏼‍♀️
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I do like this.  Most of all when I just want to freshen up my hair.  The product line improves texture, natural curl or waves.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Good product
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This is an updated review:I've ordered this before, and I don't remember it smelling foul. But when this arrived, I compared the smell against a bottle I had bought from a store. Lo and behold, this one is fake. It reeks of chemicals, with a top off of faint lavender.The bottles even look a little different- see my pic. The one on the left is from this seller, and the pink is slightly darker than the one on the right (which I bought from a store). So whomever is counterfeiting this product is pretty close with the label, but not exact. It's very deceptive. I don't even know what's really in that bottle.Bottom line: for your hair's sake, spend the extra 10 bucks, and buy it from a reputable store. It's not worth risking your hair's health, much less the smell.UPDATE: I reported this item, from the seller of my purchase, and they have deactivated the listing by that particular seller. Hopefully that will help as somewhat of a deterrent.

DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I have LOTS of 2B hair and it is a pain to wash, especially when exhausted from workdays. It is also color treated. This is a great way to get the bounce back before going out at night or after sleeping on it before starting my day. It can add some frizz, so I typically follow up by scrunching some oil through. I have been told several times people like my perfume, but it is really just this stuff; kind of an essential oil (lavender maybe?) type smell
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This product works great to refresh my curls between washings. I spritz some all over and scrunch it into my hair, then scrunch my hair into a pile on my head and secure it in a large jaw clip while I get ready in the morning. When I take it down, my curls are defined again, and any frizz I get between washings is greatly reduced. It also smells great!
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I love the DevaCurl line and this has to be their most underwhelming product. It does somewhat refresh your curls but it makes them stiff and fuses tangles into your hair. There is no way to run your fingers through to detangle and even my detangling brush had trouble getting them out at the end of the day. It's basically just hairspray with a fancy name, I would not buy again.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Turned my hair into a frizzy mess, I tossed it after trying it for a week. I've tried the gel, spray, and cream all of them made me look like Einstein.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I was looking for something to help with second day+ hair. I love my DevaCurl gel, so thought I would give Mist-er Right a try. Not helpful at all. It makes my hair look greasy and flat without doing anything for the frizz. I get better results by spritzing my hair with water and crunching in some conditioner, so I will stick with that.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I don't love this but I don't think it's terrible. I followed the directions and my curls were a little more defined than they had been but also very messy, and my hair felt really grimy until I showered, which is a feeling I really don't like.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Oh my gosh, the scent. I have never brought this product before trying it on here so I don’t know if this is how it should really smell. It smells like bug spray. After spraying it on my hair, I had to spray on perfume into my hair to mask the odor. Whoa.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Didn't work for my 3c hair. I used quite a bit and it didn't really get my curls back into shape after sleeping on them. Had to wet with water as usual.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Exactly the product described! Great for curly hair. I recommend it. I usually use it the day after I shower once my hair is all dry, and now has messed up curls from sleeping, I spray it all over my hair and bam my curls are refreshed! Also I get many compliments on my hair smelling great with this!
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I have fine hair but it’s also curly. Usually the day after washing my hair, my curls are drab and lifeless. I’ve used this twice on day 2 after washing my hair and am shocked at how well this works! My curls look as good as the day I washed them!  Big fan of this product!
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This just arrived. And holy crap it smells like pickles.  Pretty sure this is a fake. It stinks so bad it smells like I rinsed my hair with pickle juiceUpdate: I gave this a try even tho it smelled so bad. Made my normally slightly frizzy hair a mess. It feels super dry, and brittle now.  Horrible product
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Didn't work for me.  I prefer Curl Maker.Smelled great, though!
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This product is junk. I thought it was comparable to a dry shampoo, but it's the opposite. It makes my hair feel gross and doesn't help ""refresh"" my curls any more than water.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
My hair changed to curly in the last year and I was told about this product- it's a PERFECT refresher! I keep it at my office to freshen up if I'm going out after work!
"

This product doesn’t refresh anything. It makes my hair even more frizzy than if sat in a sauna for 5 minutes.

Love the brand but this product made my hair feel sticky and frizzy. Very disappointed. You’re better off using a mist bottle with water and lavender.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
This stuff is great for refreshing, but if you’ve got fine type 2 or 3A wave/curls, use sparingly as it will leave a film on your hair.

This product is very good for curly hair when it’s gotten a bit frizzy and you need to just refresh your hair and bring back the curl. It’s also good for when you wake up and want to just refresh the curls.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"

DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Let me start by saying I LOVE DevaCurl. The No-poo shampoo has a slight odor to it that is unpleasant but not unbearable being able to cover it with the conditioner and styling products.This spray STINKS and seeing as how it is meant to be a final touch up spray there is nothing to mask the smell. I used it once before returning. I wanted to see if the product was still worth using. My hair was still frizzy and it did not work like I was hoping on second day curls.I decided to dilute the styling cream in water and turn that into a touch up spay, additional moisturiser added with the water to help relax the mess works perfectly and does not have the horrible stench that is spray does.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
Terrible product. Does not work, waste of money.
"
DevaCurl Mist-er Right Dream Curl Refresher; 12oz,"
I like deva curl products, but I can not get Mister Right to work for my hair. It could just be that it's my hair that is the problem. I have extremely fine hair, so when I use this, it makes my hair super stringy and sticky. If I use it, I always regret it and can't wait to go home and wash my hair. I'm still trying to find the right curl refresher for my hair type.

"DevaCurl Holiday Cleanser, Conditioner & Styler Kit for Wavy Hair","
*Update* I used the products again this morning but left out the volumizing foam. My hair is not as weighed down as last time and definitely less frizzy than last time as well. I bought a head massaging brush to use along with the shampoo and my hair feels clean this time around. I used more gel to add definition to my curls and it worked without looking stiff. I will continue using and may repurchase if I don't find a similar product line with a better price point.I don't know if this is the real product or not. It doesn't have the citrusy smell everyone talks about. It smells like a man's cologne. Strong. Maybe I am just sensitive to the smell. The products were all unsealed as well, which caused them to leak during shipping. Perhaps they usually come unsealed, I don't know. Seemed suspicious, as ebay lists them as ""sealed"" and ""genuine"". I just tried them for the first time, assuming they were a fake product, but the shampoo did not lather so I thought, ""Ah, maybe it is genuine."" I then used the conditioner. It was thick and creamy, but smells awful as well. Followed by the volumizing foam and then the gel. My hair now looks extremely flat and frizzy/dry on the ends, despite focusing my attention to them.  We will see how it dries and I will update in a few days after continued use. I'm sure it takes time. I don't want to set my expectations too high! So far, 3 stars.

I have been wearing my hair 'natural' for about 2 years and have tried just about every product safe for a curly girl.  Gels are too heavy and only last one day, but I only wash my hair once or twice a week, so for a couple of days I braid or ponytail it (my hair is pretty long).  I have a mixed up mess on my head.  I have some that's 1a, 2b-c 3a, etc.  I thought what the heck - I've tried everything else, so I tried it.  Are you kidding me?  It's perfect!!! It's not heavy, it doesn't get sticky and still looks good on day 4 or 5.  I sleep with it loose and when I get up it's mostly ok (silk pillowcase) and all I have to do is spray it with a little bit of conditioner water and it goes back in place.  I think the key is using it on wet (not dripping) hair and using the deva towel to scrunch.  I'll just say - it's amazing, for me anyway. Did I mention that  the humidity has been around 100% for the past week - no problem - seriously.

Shipping was quick and easy! This product does not work for me. It gives me no volume but it leaves my hair silky soft. The only reason why I don’t knock it is because I’ve seen it work wonders for other women. I have 2b/2c hair but my hair is very thin and therefore has no volume. I think this product works better for women with thick hair but it’s just too heavy for my hair and makes it look flat. I need something with a little more hold, but if you’re someone who has defined curls, this product will probably be amazing for you.

This is my favorite product for styling my fine curly hair. I use two large dollops and a bit of the light deva gel to scrunch when wet and let it air dry. Perfect style every time.  It had really improved the health of my hair to let it go curly and natural more often . Just needed the right product and technique!

I have chin to shoulder-length wavy hair and this product creates ringlets and beachy waves really perfectly; it's my favorite of their products along with the styling cream.  It's a bit stiffer than Devacurl's other products, so you have to warm it up in your hands and/or mix it with water, then apply it to sopping wet hair for best results.  The only thing I don't like about it is the smell.  For some reason, each of Devacurl's products has a different scent.  They're all light and usually pleasant, but this one doesn't appeal to me.
"
"DevaCurl WaveMaker, 3oz","
I love this stuff.  I have looked for years for a version of a curl cream that would not feel stiff and separate my big waves.  Curl Maker holds my waves, feels soft and doesn't make it look like it is still wet!  It looks totally natural and soft.

My naturally curly hair has never, EVER looked better! Soft, touchable curls straight out of the shower with minimal rearranging.Seriously, where has this product been ALL my life? I am including two pics so that you can see what my hair was like before I used the product, and after. In the first picture (taken at the waterfront in Seward, AK) you can see I have natural waves without product. In pics 2 and 3, totally different hair! No perms, root touch-ups b/c I am not ready for the reality that is grey hairs, and an ash-wash to pull out brassiness that happened from our water here in Alaska.I originally bought this from my hair salon, for a good bit more because #overhead and also #Alaska. DēvaCurl your products are the #curlbomb I've been longing for, since I realized I had curly hair (30 years ago!!).Thank you!

I was on a quest for a product that would allow me to wear my hair curly to work. My hair is naturally thick, curly (not ringlets), and frizzy. I saw this product get rave reviews on youtube and decide to test it out. Several youtubers who swear by the curly hair method recommends deva curl products because the ingredients are clean (silicone free, paraben free).How I used it: I washed my hair with shea shampoo and conditioned it with Maui conditioner (both for curly hair). Then while toweling off I applied the product generously to my hair and let it be.Frizz: The frizz is a less with this product compared to most other drug store products on the market (specifically Dove, Garnier, Herbal Essence products). Prior to the Devacurl, I typically used leave in conditioner and moose. Devacurl has  less frizz. Even after 8 hours, the frizz is less than other products on the market.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the frizziest, Devacurl products leave my hair with a frizz level of 5 and most drug store products leave me at a frizz level of 7.Touch: My hair does not feel super soft when I touch it. You can definitely tell there is product in my hair. My hair does not feel stuck either, like when you have cheap gel on.  Somewhere in the middle.Curls: This product will bring out and define your curls. When I don't have product in my hair, my hair is naturally more wavy than curly. This product will bring out my curls even if I don't do much scrunching while I put the product on.Drying: There are several Youtubers who recommend using a diffuser with this product to help speed up the drying process. I usually just let it air dry.  After the shower, drying with a microfiber towel or cotton tshirt can also help minimize the frizz.Weight: My hair does not feel weighed down or lifeless. I would say that it retains volume and bounce.Value: This product does work but it's more expensive compared to other products in the drug store. You get what you pay for. My hair length is about 5 inches below my shoulder. I can wear my hair curly about 10 times per tube.3 stars: I took off one star because although the frizz is less, it's still there. I am still on the quest for the perfect product!

I got a sample from my stylist a month ago and it fits in nicely with the successful Devacurl line.  Devacurl has been a great product line for me, providing I do the work to keep my hair hydrated. My hair is super curly and it's partially bleached and regularly dyed purple.  Curly hair is naturally very, very, dry, so if you're having trouble, make sure you're using deep conditioning treatments 1-2 times a week.  I let the regular conditioner sit in my hair for nearly my entire shower as well before rinsing most of it out.  I also try to get a salon deep conditioning treatment whenever I get a haircut.Here's how I use this product: take a drop of Heaven In Hair deep conditioning treatment, mix it around in your hands for a while until it turns really white.  Then add a 2-3 pea-sized drop of this Wave-Maker and mix it in with the conditioning treatment, apply to hair and scrunch.  It keeps my hair soft and still defined.If you have trouble with this product, you're probably using too much or your hair is too dry for it to work correctly.  Go to a stylist, get a deep conditioning treatment (Redken has a nice protein treatment for in-salon use only), and try again.

Original product and packaging.  Great full sizes for shampoo and conditioner. The others I would say are travel size or testers but still nice to have for the price.

For the price it's worth a shot, better deal than I have found in any store.

Love the Devacurl Decadence No-poo. It thoroughly cleanses without stripping. The No-poo and One Condition are both great for detangling my 4A hair. I prefer the One Condition as a Leave-in over Devacurl's official leave-in that comes in this kit. I haven't tried the Wash Day Wonder as I have shorter, high porosity hair which detangles well with a coconut oil pre-poo.

Another awful scent failure by Deva.  If you like the smell of stale baby bottom products this will be great for you.  If you would like to avoid headaches from smelling nasty baby changing products all day long this is probably not for you.  Not to mention how creepy people look at you when they smell this nasty stuff on you.  It is like you bathed in diaper changing lotions, just vile.

I got this my coworker for her birthday who's said she's always had unmanageable curls that just frizz without much of a form to them. After using the trial pack for about a week or so, she said it's the first time in 30 years she feels confident enough to wear her hair down. Her frizz has massively subsided, ringlets are forming and the products aren't heavy and don't leave a greasy or oily residue. I've attached a before and after picture to show the difference!

This set introduced me to products that my hair loved so much that I’ll now make part of my routine.  The standouts are the coconut supecream (smells great and creates lovely, shiny spiral curls) and the washday wonder (use pre no-poo to loosen those tangles).  This set has made wash day fun again.

If you have very long, lightened, curly hair I would say this product line isn’t for you. Over a period of 2 months I have lost around 8”-10” of length of my lightened hair. I sheet you not. Please don’t use this unless your hair is super strong and healthy. Not good for bleached hair that was FINE & growing normally before using this. I used the entire line for 10 weeks and got massive breakage.Buildup buster, pre-poo, low poo, 3 of the conditioners, the detangle spray, all 3 gels, mousse, you name it, I am back to my old stuff trying to deal with the massive loss of hair.I’ll say that if you have strong, non porous hair this would be great but not good on white girl lightened curly hair!

I have been using this product for a couple of years but always got it from a local store. I needed more quickly so decided to try Amazon. I may be paranoid but the smell blew me away when I received it. Then my hair dried out and began falling out in clumps in the shower. And the flakes! After it dries my hair feels like straw and flakes go everywhere. I luckily had the end of another bottle (from the local store) and the smell is pleasant not pungent. I swear the Amazon version is not real?!?! I have to stop using it out of sheer paranoia. So disappointed!

I have naturally thick, coarse, shoulder-length curls and my hair is also color-treated. Prior to discovering this product at a salon, I thought only very greasy products could control my frizz and define my curls, but of course I would be left with greasy residue in my hair all the time. I’m also an adherent to the Deva philosophy of using much less shampoo— at this point I condition and rinse every other day, and only shampoo about once a week. The B’Leave-In is my daily savior. It has a very fresh, citrusy smell (like lemongrass) and leaves my head smelling like the aromatherapy aisle at Whole Foods! (The scent disippates in an hour or so and won’t clash with your perfume). It is liquify and light, almost like a very light-hold gel; you won’t get crunchy hair or tight hold with this at all, but it will keep the frizz in check and keep your hair smoothed down, even in the rain! The best part is that it rinses cleanly (no oil, no silicone) and there is no build-up. Great stuff, and a 16-ounce bottle lasts me a couple months.

This product is my holy grail. I have ALWAYS struggled with frizz and undefined curls and I’ve used all sorts of different products ranging from leave in conditioners to pomades to mouse and gel. Nothing has worked for me as well as this has!A little tip for those using this for the first time: untangle your hair and part it in small sections, use only on sopping wet hair. If you have a lot of hair, apply generously until hair is wet and silky and then scrunch the excess out.After you’ve applied to your entire head, diffuse, diffuse, diffuse!This plumper is completely weightless and leaves hair smelling so good!

Do not order Deva products from Amazon!!! This product felt water downed and doesn’t work as good and you will be wasting your money. I have also tried using other devacurl products from Amazon and they have all felt the same. I went to purchase real Deva products from a lincense Salon in my area and they told me that most of the products are fake on amazon or it’s not devacurl. They have tested the difference themselves and it may be the Devacurl Bottle but the product inside isn’t. Best places to buy are on the website, Ulta or lincense Salons.

This is a great product, I've used it for years.  What I received from Amazon, however, was definitely not DevaCurl. It is not the product I've been using. It immediately dried out my hair.  I had to throw the whole bottle out, which was a complete waste of money.  At first I wondered if DevaCurl changed the formula, but I've since purchased from Sephora several times which is the product I know/love. Purchase from Sephora, Ulta, or direct from Devacurl instead. Wanted to give this 0 starts, but it wasn't an option.

I've been using this for over a year now and my hair is healthy, soft, and looks great. The key with devacurl is to use the right product line for your curl type. There are lots of options and it may take some experimenting before you find the right product mix and amount. I think it's well worth the effort.

This is an excellent product to get and create plump fluffy curls. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because if you are heavy handed with the product (as I am with regular gel like products), it will build up and flake. Therefore, I combine this with light defining gel and get the perfect big, voluminous curls.

After it dries my hair feels like straw and flakes go everywhere. I luckily had the end of another bottle (from the local store) and the smell is pleasant not pungent. I swear the Amazon version is not real?!?! I have to stop using it out of sheer paranoia. So disappointed!

I love Deva products. I had purchased a different presentation of this product and loved it so I purchased bigger container here at Amazon. The texture of the product is different, so I called DevaCurl directly and they told me that the vendor is not authorized and that I could be getting product that has been manipulated (watered  down)... price different is significant $40 for buying at manufacturer website

I have naturally thick, coarse, shoulder-length curls and my hair is also color-treated. Prior to discovering this product at a salon, I thought only very greasy products could control my frizz and define my curls, but of course I would be left with greasy residue in my hair all the time. I’m also an adherent to the Deva philosophy of using much less shampoo— at this point I condition and rinse every other day, and only shampoo about once a week. The B’Leave-In is my daily savior. It has a very fresh, citrusy smell (like lemongrass) and leaves my head smelling like the aromatherapy aisle at Whole Foods! (The scent disippates in an hour or so and won’t clash with your perfume). It is liquify and light, almost like a very light-hold gel; you won’t get crunchy hair or tight hold with this at all, but it will keep the frizz in check and keep your hair smoothed down, even in the rain! The best part is that it rinses cleanly (no oil, no silicone) and there is no build-up. Great stuff, and a 16-ounce bottle lasts me a couple months.

This product is my holy grail. I have ALWAYS struggled with frizz and undefined curls and I’ve used all sorts of different products ranging from leave in conditioners to pomades to mouse and gel. Nothing has worked for me as well as this has!A little tip for those using this for the first time: untangle your hair and part it in small sections, use only on sopping wet hair. If you have a lot of hair, apply generously until hair is wet and silky and then scrunch the excess out.After you’ve applied to your entire head, diffuse, diffuse, diffuse!This plumper is completely weightless and leaves hair smelling so good!

Do not order Deva products from Amazon!!! This product felt water downed and doesn’t work as good and you will be wasting your money. I have also tried using other devacurl products from Amazon and they have all felt the same. I went to purchase real Deva products from a lincense Salon in my area and they told me that most of the products are fake on amazon or it’s not devacurl. They have tested the difference themselves and it may be the Devacurl Bottle but the product inside isn’t. Best places to buy are on the website, Ulta or lincense Salons.

In using the product B’Leave-In by Deve Curl I have found a great love for it. Deva Curl has brought my hair to life again. Using B’Leave-In has rekindled my love of my hair. I would recommend this to anyone and it’s worth every dollar.

The pump  was broken when I opened the box:( so I was already upset at amazon but I figure I’ll make it work and try it before I return this. So I did and it left my hair feeling so dry. I hear and read great reviews on all devacurl products, but it did  not work well on my 3c/4a curls:( sadly I am returning this and I’m just gonna stick with my sheamoisture JBCO leave in:) that line works better for my hair and less expensive too!

This is a great product, I've used it for years.  What I received from Amazon, however, was definitely not DevaCurl. It is not the product I've been using. It immediately dried out my hair.  I had to throw the whole bottle out, which was a complete waste of money.  At first I wondered if DevaCurl changed the formula, but I've since purchased from Sephora several times which is the product I know/love. Purchase from Sephora, Ulta, or direct from Devacurl instead. Wanted to give this 0 starts, but it wasn't an option.

"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
I've been using this for over a year now and my hair is healthy, soft, and looks great. The key with devacurl is to use the right product line for your curl type. There are lots of options and it may take some experimenting before you find the right product mix and amount. I think it's well worth the effort.
"
"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
This is an excellent product to get and create plump fluffy curls. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because if you are heavy handed with the product (as I am with regular gel like products), it will build up and flake. Therefore, I combine this with light defining gel and get the perfect big, voluminous curls.

Arrive with  broken top with some of the contents spilled all over inside the box. I've odered from here with no problem so will just use the top from my old bottle and swallow the spilled product. I absolutely love this product - my hair hold its curl without being stiff and looking wet.

"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
If you are a curly or wavy hair girl you should try this product.  You scrunch it into wet or damp hair and let your hair dry.  Then scrunch out the crunch.  As a wavy girl who likes being a curly girl, this does the trick.  I use it daily and the regular sized tube gets used up way to quickly.  I'm thankful to find this large size as it is much more economical.

this product does a great job at holding my curls and i have soft curls that would easily ""wilt"" without this product. it holds the curls even better than the deva angel (which is also a good product).. great price too! very expensive in hair salons.

I have fine curly hair, which means most gels are too heavy for my hair.  This leaves it bouncy and springy without drying it out.  Looks great on day 2.  I buy it all the time, even though its a little expensive.
"
"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
From someone who used to use a lot of products to get the style I wanted, I felt like I needed more than just the 3 step process. So I bought this and I actually like it. Not sure if it really does anything extravagant compared to the conditioner and ultra defining gel, but for my second day hair, instead of using more gel, I add some of this mixed with a little gel and my hair looks wonderful.I only bought a 12 ounce bottle of the One Condition, so I didn't want to kill it, so I share that work with the leave on. I like it, it adds volume, shine. And definition. I use it in soaking wet hair and dry hair,
"
"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
I bought this after I started using other Deva curl products. It has since become necessary to my morning routine to keep my frizz taned and my curls soft and full. I apply it after the light defining gel and it makes a huge difference!

I have 4a corkscrew hair and This product does plump up my curls but I can't use it alone.  The instructions say to completely rinse out the One Condition but if I do that my hair is very dry under this product so I don't wash it out.  I use this as a styling product, not as a conditioner.  I really like the slip.  It does create foam in your hair but I just squeeze most of that down the drain.  I don't think this will be a staple product for me from the line though.
"

This worked much better for me than the gel, much less stiff but still helped by fine, thin wavy curls. One quarter-size squirt is plenty for my past-the-shoulders hair. Much more natural looking than the gel.

It's not sticky or greasy, and you can use it generously or sparsely as your hair requires. Scrunch it in to very wet hair and then dab or scrunch dry with a cloth or tshirt. I'm now addicted to it. The devacurl products are worth every penny.

For several years I had been straightening my curly hair even though I prefer the curls. That was because it was mostly unmanageable and frizzy, and would usually start looking strange and lose its bounce by the third week from the products I used.I decided to try the DevaCurl line, and started with the One Conditioner and the Angel gel. It looked alot better than before, but the gel was making my hair dry. I was advised to switch to the leave-in and the styling cream instead of the gel.I have been using it now for several months, and it's looking healthier and healthier.I wash my hair with the low poo, then add the conditioner. I wash some of the conditioner out but leave most of it. I use a paper towel to get rid of the dripping water, or use my hands, then I immediately add in a good chunk of leave-in conditioner. I use the styling cream after and blow dry it with a diffuser (much better curl definition than letting it air-dry). Looks great for at least two days. I sometimes use the mister to put some bounce back into it on the 2nd or 3rd day.I usually don't use gels or products that make my hair feel unnatural, and when I was told to use all these products I was worried it might weigh my curls down or feel gunky, but it doesn't at all. Hope this review helps.

Another wonderful product from DevaCurl. It's a leave-in that's wet enough to use on dry hair as a finishing, smoothing product, but thick enough to sink into wet hair and make it lovely and soft. Love it!

I have been using this product for years and love it.  I am 100% a Deva girl and swear by most of their products.  I often order my products from Amazon because the prices are better and I am able to get the product in 2 days with my Prime account.  Having done this with no problems multiple times I feel bad writing a negative review however I felt the need to warn my fellow customers.  I ordered the 16oz B'leave-in (perhaps waiting a little too long because I am now out of the product) and received my package today only to find the 6oz bottle with a 16oz sticker on it.  I dont know if this was Amazon's fault or the seller's (IVANYCH) fault but either way its a terrible inconvenience.  At first I thought they were trying to charge me $33 for the small bottle which infuriated me but I soon realized that the wrong sticker was put on the bottle which makes me think they may have placed the wrong sticker on multiple bottles.  I contacted Amazon and while they immediately offered to issue me a refund, they could not re send the correct product and told me I would have to reorder the item and send back the wrong one.  While this is not a big deal, its really inconvenient for me, especially since I need the product now and thought I would have it in time and now I have to wait multiple days.  So I am writing this as a warning to those buying this product.  Its an incredible product especially when used with the one conditioner and arc angel gel, but make sure you got the proper product (for such an expensive product you should get your money's worth)

I use it straight from the bottle as well as I watered it down to use from a spray bottle and am happy with both.

I used to love this product. It was more of a leave in conditioner (they called it a moisture supplement) that gave my hair needed moisture without any greasiness, AND for the most part the ingredients were no cause for concern. I just reordered the product and was VERY disappointed to see that it is now called a 'curl booster and volumizer' and the ingredients read like all the other chemical laden products I was trying to get away from. I was worried this was going to happen. A respectable ingredient list always seems just out of grasp... Sigh. I still gave it a try, and it just makes my hair feel heavy, not greasy, just heavy and not moisturized at all.

This product defined my curls like crazy and had great shine but i can flake if you use to much or without enough leave in conditioner. This product I will definitely repurchase as a gel styler.

Let me start by saying I love Deva Curl. I have long s'wavy hair, so maybe this product isn't for me. I have issues retaining my curl after my hair dries. This product didn't really work for my hair. Rather than keep my bounce, it weighted my long hair and made it feel a bit gunky. I'll stick to the No Poo and Conditioner.

This product works very well if you use it correctly. I use with the DevaCurl Set It  Up and Above... I mix it together in my palm and work it through WET hair. It works amazingly to control frizz and define the curl. It lasts all day/ night. You have to play around with it to get the correct amount... I have very thin hair so I do not need too much.  I also use the DevaCurl Low-Poo and One Condition products which make a world of a difference opposed to using commercial products.

I use this after shampooing  BTW, I just use a good sulfate free shampoo, not necessarily Deva.  This  by far my favorite find of all their products.  It is what really defines my curls into nice seperate and distinct strands.  I use it while my hair is soaking wet and rake it through.  Then I scrunch with a microfiber towel.  After scrunching so that there are no more drips and drops, I apply the Gel.  I don't rake it through with my fingers.  I just seal the curls that have already been defined in place. No frizzies!!

This does it's job to an extent but I get flakes in my hair when I use it which I do not like.  I've tried mixing this with another leave in and it seems to help reduce the flake situation.

I am so happy with this product,  I literally want to marry it! I have struggled a lifetime with my fine ""boticelli"" type curls, and finally have the answer!

I use the decadence line no poo and conditioner then I add super cream then b leave in and the glaze my hair with eco Aragon oil styling gel it gives me the most defined curls I tried the arc angel hair gel but it doesn't give me the hold I like but I can get 3-4 days out of my wash n go before I need to wash again.

Once you know how to properly use this product you'll be in love.  My stylist taught me how to use it on damp hair using a microfiber cloth. First scrunch it in, then use the microfiber cloth to scrunch.  It leaves lovely ringlets or body without being stiff.  Within minutes you can touch up your style with a curling or flat iron if needed.

"
"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
This product is amazing on my naturally curly hair, I can really tell a difference when I run out!  Seems expensive but a little goes a long way!  I have shoulder length hair and use about a quarter sized amount. My stylist told me to apply a small amount in the shower while my hair was still drenched, then scrunch it through from roots to ends using the water in your hair to help distribute.  Works great like that, before I was using when I got out of the shower and it was too heavy for my curls and I ended up with crunchy hair.  I have tried the entire Deva Curl line and found it eventually left my hair dull with a lot of build up....but I've stuck with this for about 2 years now and found nothing comparable to give you soft bouncy curls that feel product free!

My favorite gel! It gives my curls awesome definition without making my hair crunchy. It smells great and if I apply it before I get out of the shower, per the DevaCurl Method, it makes my curls much tighter. It can be reactivated the next day by dampening my hair and scrunching. I have used it when flat-ironing my hair, and it gives light-weight control to whatever style I pick for the day.

I have always purchased my deva curl products at the salon.  I have used B'leave in for years and it has been terrific. When I purchased it online, it isn't at all the same as the same product in the salon.  It is watery and does not condition as well as the salon bought product. This is very disappointing.

This line of product came highly recommended from a friend, and I have to say, I'm very disappointed.  Maybe I'm just used to using natural hair products, but they all smell and feel too 'chemically' to me.  I thought the product line was supposed to provide extra moisture for your curls.  My hair has never been so dry.  Now I need to go get all my freshly-split ends cut off, and I'm trying to grow out my hair!  I'm going back to my old products and giving these to my friend.  Money wasted.

Hello, so I recently went to the Devachan Salon for a cut.  I was asking the apprentice questions as she washed and prepared my hair with product about the B'leave in.  She explained to me that B'leave in is not a leave in conditioner even though it does soften the hair and add luster because it doesn't really moisturize.  Nor is this product a gel even though it has that consistency because it doesn't offer hold.  It is best considered a hair primer.  Just like a makeup primer it goes on after your moisturizer and before you styling product.  It provides a base for your gel to adhere to extending the results to your textured hair. On me she put deva one conditioner as a leave in for my hair then B'leave in and lastly Ultra defining gel.  I went under a dryer and then the stylist scrunched my hair to remove the cast.  My wavy/curly hair was amazing and the definition and shine lasted to day five!  Love the product now that I understand what it is and how to use it.
"
"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
I've read all the reviews, good and bad, for B'Leave In.  Actually, all of them are correct.  When I first tried the product, I hated it.  It didn't seem to do a thing for my hair, and my hair felt dry and dirty.  I then read the book written by the line's creator (very good, by the way), and realized I hadn't been using it correctly.You need to use a LOT of this product, and you need to use it on wet (not damp) hair.  You apply at least a quarter-sized glob to the underside of the hair at the back of your head.  Then do the same for the outerside of the back, the sides, and the front/top.  Those amounts are approximate based on my short, very thick, very dry hair.Once I started using the correct amount, the improvement in my hair was dramatic.  It took care of my intense frizz, while leaving the curl looking beautiful.With all products for curly hair, you need to experiment to find the ones that work best for you.  All I can say is that I love B'Leave In, and love what it does for my very thick, very coarse hair.

When I moved to Utah several years ago from humid Texas, I was dismayed to find my bouncy curls turn to straight straw.  Who knew I had such sparse hair???  B'Leave-In has restored the curl and really does make my hair look fuller.  Love this stuff.

This is the only leave-in conditioner that I use on my hair.  I have tried many brands and paid a lot of money for the really expensive varieties only to be disappointed and out of money.  Deva Curl products are the only products that work for my hair leaving curls defined and soft.  Plus, it's one of the lesser expensive but high end hair product I've found and have been so satisfied with.  I also recommend the conditioning cleanser and the conditioner.  So far, the prices I've found on Amazon.com for the larger version of this product is better than the beauty supply stores and salons I go to purchase this product.

I have very long, fine hair with type 3A curls. The first time I used this, I used it like a normal gel or styling cream (I used probably about a nickel-quarter sized amount) without any other styling products. This product definitely does add boost, volume, and shine to curls but does not act as a clumping agent and doesn't have much hold on its own. I ended up with overall more separated curls that had volume but looked very limp the second day after washing. I now use this product in combination with Tigi's ""On the Rebound"" curl recall cream and it is absolutely amazing. This combination of products has given me the results I have been looking for with my curls for years. I first apply a generous amount of the curl cream and distribute just a small drop of B'Leave In evenly throughout my hair, and I end up with amazing, perfectly formed, volumized curls that hold their shape for 2-3 days. While I personally wouldn't use this product alone for my type of curls, I couldn't recommend it more when it is used in small amounts in combination with a styling cream.

I really like this stuff but think it’s  expensive for 16oz which I can use up quickly. I might be able to get a better price with a larger size but haven’t found one. In order to make this size last, I pour some of it into a clear spray bottle and mix it with water (say, 1 part conditioner to 3 parts water). I spritz it on my hair while still soaking wet and gently pat it dry with a Deva towel. It really takes away the frizz while not making my hair crunchy or flaky. (I have tight curls and lots of frizz.) Since I found this solution, “B-leave In” has become one of my favorite Deva Curl products, especially since I get more bang for my buck as well.
"
"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
I have loved all of the other Diva Curl products I've tried, but this one was a waste. My hair dresser used this product in addition to the Coconut Crème product and I loved how my hair turned out. I bought this and used it without the coconut product, and it was a total disaster. This product made my hair super frizzy, and felt greasy too. Apparently it's only good if you mix it with something else (at least on my hair). I would have bought a trial size, but couldn't find it, so just went for it in the big bottle, and that was a mistake.

It works to hold my hair in place without feeling heavy or crunchy, but I get more wave than curl. My hair does it's own thing - sometimes curly, sometimes wavy, sometimes frizzy - but this product makes it barely wavy. Not what I was going for, but I generally let my hair do what it wants. We get along better that way.

I have very frizzy 3b curly hair, and this works great! I prefer my hair with lots of big volume with as little frizz as possible. B'Leave In helps with both, and when I use it with a few other smoothing/frizz control products, I've been able to get an extra day out of my hair before I have to wash and restyle! It's definitely not a product I personally can use to wash and go, but that's almost impossible to find with my hair. I definitely recommend it!
"

I was a little skeptical ordering devacurl on amazon simply because I heard a lot of people saying to just watch out because these sellers can be filling the product with something else or might be a duplicate of the brand, but everything worked out great it is the actual brand and I love devacurl products in general I like to mix this with the one decadence condition in the shower to style it while my hair is wet and also to avoid making a mess outside with the hair products.

YES!  I have fine, thinning curly hair (wouldn't be my choice, but you have to play the hand you're dealt!).  After I use the No-Poo and the One Conditioner, this is the product I use next.  It gives my hair wonderful body and helps control the frizz.  Without it my hair would be an out-of-control frizzy mess  :)

I've been using Deva products for about 5 years. I use B'Leave along with Deva Curl's Light Defining Gel. My curls drink this stuff up.  It has a light clean scent and works through my hair easily.

Other reviews mentioned this product produces flakes in hair, that looks like dandruff...well is true.

I'm getting to be disappointed with this whole Deva line....

This is a light weight, non-sticky gel with little build-up.  It does impart some shine and I love the pump bottle.  I just wish it controlled the frizz better so I wouldn't have to use another product with it.

this is my favorite DevaCurl product, hands down.  It is the only one I always have on hand - the first layer before I use anything else!  I have wavy/curly spirals and they are SO fussy.

works great as a Volumizer and for frizz control....don't be fooled by the name it's not a conditioner and I knew that when I purchased it as a recomendation from a stylist.

I use the Devacare one condition and the light defining gel as well.

The other comments are correct---this does dry flaky.  I had showers of flakes flying off my clean hair the first time I used it.  Now I just use very little, about 1-3 pumps, more as a finishing shield, and it is fine. It is lighter than the Deva gel and the definition is not as hard and tight.

I've been using this product for about half a year consistently and find my hair is breaking more often despite the soft curls DevaCurl gives me.

A few pumps after I wash my hair and I am out the door. When my hair dries, I have soft, easy, natural curls. Combine with a gel to keep your curls in order for a few days. My natural curls fall out by day 2 if I don't use gel. Before this product all I had was frizz.

I've been using B Leave-In conditioner for over a year now and it's a great product.  I put it on while in the shower while my hair is sopping wet and I've found that works best for me.  My stylist consistently remarks on how much healthier my hair is and I attribute that to switching over to Deva Curl products.  My general routine is to use No-Poo, followed by a quick condition with One Condition.  I rinse that out, then apply B Leave-in.  Once out of the shower, I use Ultra-light gel.  I've recently started occasionally using Deva Curl Volumizing Foam and SuperCream Coconut Curl Styler.  This combination has allowed my natural curl to come back along with a pretty shine.

I have fine hair (in my 40's) however in my teens/twenties/thirties it was thick and very wavy.  This product brings out the natural wave I had, even now that my hair has changed.

Heard about this product and heard some good things so I thought I would give it a try. Soooooo disappointed. It is very drying to my hair and feels like it offers no moisture. From experience I know not one products works for everyone but being a leave in conditioner I didn't expect for my hair to feel so dry even if it didn't define my curls the way I would've liked. And I am really not a fan of how it smells. Sure wish I could return it because I feel like I just threw away my money. I was looking for a pepduct to change up my routine a bit but i guess I will just stick with my Mixed Chicks that always works great for me.

I love the product, but when i received the item the pump spout was broken! While I can still use the product, it is frustrating to have to take the spout off every time to use it.

I went CG about 8 months ago, and I have been using Devacurl products almost exclusively.  I have tried their mousse, gel, and this is the best leave in styling product that I have used.  I have very find delicate cherub curls, and the gel makes my hair too stringy, while the foam doesn't seem to give my hair enough hold.  I put a nickels worth of this on my hair, and my curls love it.  It works as well as silicone products on my hair, but without the buildup.  This is a great product for people with fine or delicate curls.  I am very pleased with this :)

I have a fair amount of short, fine textured curly hair.  I used to use a combo of products to get the curls to remain frizz free and defined until I switched hairstylists and she used the B-leave in on my hair when cutting it the first time....and this was all she used.  I was amazed at how well it worked.  She didn't sell it in the salon at that point ( had run out) so I searched and found it on Amazon and thought it was pricey to start with, but ordered it anyway...I dont' normally buy salon products, but found out that the 16 oz size ( comes in a pump, not tube) lasts me almost 4 months for my short- medium hair.  You do need to use a lot for it to work well...I use 2 full pumps on my wet hair and 1 more small pump to finish it once dried w/ a diffuser. Most of the time I use nothing else other than hairspray.  If I want more of a shiny, crunchy look, then I may also apply just a quarter size amount of mousse but that's only on wet rainy days when I want extra protection.  Keep in mind this is NOT a a leave in conditioner, it's a styling product.

I am the biggest fan ever of Deva Curl products!!!! I love this gel .....  it's not heavy, and doesn't weigh my curls down. In fact, it adds volume to my curls!!! I love the texture and smell too!!!

I didn't realize that it was mainly a volumizer.  I thought it was a leave in conditioner. I have extremely thick hair, so I will not be able to use this product in the hot, humid summers of DC.  But I plan to use it this winter

I've been using Deva products for nearly three years now, and it took me a move across the country and finding another stylist to be introduced to this product.  It works wonders on my fine, curly hair.  I mix about 4 parts of this product with one part of the AnGel product, then slather it on.  Using this product alone does not give my curls enough staying power, I need the firmness of the AnGel gel too in order for them to keep their shape and not get frizzy.  I'd recommend curly girls with fine hair give this a try.  Experiment a bit with mixing it with other products, and the amount you use.  I will definitely be buying this again.
"
"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
I have fine thick curly hair and I have even used this alone and it really helps tame my flyaway hair without weighing it down. I love the smell and I have used it with and without the gel.

"DevaCurl B'Leave-In Miracle Curl Plumper, 16oz","
I used too much the first two times.  My hair is above shoulder length, fine and thin.  One pump is all that I need.  Anyone tying this for the first time might want to start out using as small amount as they can and  then check results and adjust for the next shower/application.  Too much of this product left my hair  crisp and hard...even when  scrunching repeatedly after it was dry.  It's my early experience with the Devacurl line and I'm still on the fence about some of the other products.  This one  acts a lot like a gel I used to get by Revlon that was 8L in holding strength (which they stopped making  about 10 years ago).  I'm glad to fine a close replacement.

I've been using this product for a few years.  My hair is curly but fine so I use this as a post-shampoo conditioner.  It's light but provides good definition and hold.

Does a good job of boosting fine hair, but does nothing to moisturize or hold hair like gel and mousse will. Great if used with a hair gel.

This is a great addition to the Deva line and step.  I typically use this if I'm showering and going to bed (read: not going anywhere after a shower).  It just gives a little shine, bounce and step.  I don't use it daily - but a great curl enhancer when you aren't really looking to ""do"" your hair, but yet, want it curly! Smells great.Also, for those quick mornings I don't have time to do the whole Deva process (read: I slept in...again), it works like a very light gel.  Yet, conditions.

i use all the deva products, this one made my hair too, soft.  actually took the curl out.  as i have aged my hair has softened.  if you have tight curl and friz this would probably work well.  also, in a very humid environment it will work also.

One of the few curly girl DevaCurl products I'm not a fan of. I absolutely love almost all of the other DevaCurl products.

Love this product! My hair is wavy and prone to frizz. Apply this product on really wet hair, scrunch and allow to air dry. Hair comes out SOFT, with waviness enhanced, and frizz free. Once dry the product is so light weight, you can't even tell there is product in your hair. I live in Florida, so frizz was a fact of life until I found this product. Buy it now.

I'm not exactly sure what type of hair I have. I think I have 2c hair. My hair is long, almost down to my bra strap.I first use the Devacurl Low-poo.... then I condition with Suave naturals coconut, then I use devacurl One condition. I rake it through my hair, and scrunch my hair all over. After leaving it on for 5-10 mins, I rinse it out by scrunching my hair upside down under the water. with my head still upstide down, I scrunch a few more times, to get some excess water out of my hair, but I still want my hair full of water. Then I apply the Devacurl B'Leave In.I apply it to soaking wet hair. I also put about a quarters worth to one side of my head, raking it through, and scrunching.... and then put another quarters worth to the other side... Raking and then scrunch several times. then tilt head to the left and scrunch and then to the right and scrunch and then upside down again and Scrunch!  Then I follow with Devacurl Arc Angel. Only scrunch another few times, after apply the Arc Angel or it could cause frizz. Then I immediately Plop for 5-6 mins. That's all my hair can handle.  Take out the plop and immediately diffuse. But I diffuse, very slowly and Very carely. I usually use high heat. I diffuse with my hair upside down for 5 mins - and then tilt head to the left and diffuse for 4-5 mins - and to the right, and diffuse..... then flip your head upside down again. Keep repeating the process til you have awesome Curls!! I have recently heard of a technique that I tried last week and I really like.Apply the B'Leave in in the shower with wet hair, Then Plop, then diffuse till hair is 50% dry, Then apply your Arc Angel gel or whatever gel you like... and continue to diffuse. My hair seemed fuller. I have only tried that one time, but loved it. Will try again this week.The B'Leave in is a wonderful product, you may have to play around with and find what works for you. I really do love this product along with the other Devacurl products. I bought the 16oz size, for around $21.00. That has been the cheapest price I have seen.

Love it!  Works better on my thin wavy curls than the Light Gel.  I use it with a little bit of the Heaven In Hair moisture treatment (used as a styling cream not a moisture treatment), and my curls turn out great.  My hair isn't weighed down at all and I have great curls for days.  When I want to refresh my curls for day 2 (and even sometimes day 3!) I mix this product with a little bit of the Heaven In Hair and water in a spray bottle.  I spray my hair all over then flip my head and use the diffuser on a low setting so set the curls again.  Works like a dream!

I have fine curly to wavy hair. I also have Celiac disease. I was disappointed to find this product has wheat protein in it which helps my hair to fall out and I also disliked the smell of product.  It did not add volume to my hair....I felt I was careful on the amount of product I used but it left my hair looking stiff and greasy.

I've been following the Curly Girl method (see Curly Girl: The Handbook for over a year, but I started out by using smaller, boutique lines before trying Deva products.  When I started getting Deva cuts last year, I started incorporating their products into my regimen -- and B'Leave In is one of my favorites in the line!My Deva stylist first suggested this for my fine, wavy hair, and it adds volume and lots of curl to my locks.  The trick, as another reviewer mentioned, is to use this on really wet, saturated hair; I have hair that's about five inches past my shoulders, and I use about three pumps all over, really scrunching it into my hair.  I then apply a lot of AnGel, clip my roots, and dry my hair.  I get nice, soft waves with a lot of definition and fullness.Great product that's worth a try if you have a similar hair type!

I'm writing a quick review because I'm seeing some misconceptions in other reviews. I've been using this product for about 8 months. Despite the name, this is NOT a leave-in conditioner. It's a voluminizer. It's not a gel. It's a curl & volume booster than you put on under your gel or styling products. It has protein in it. So don't use if your hair doesn't like protein.For me, this is a holy grail product. I use it every time I wash. I also use it for 2nd day hair mixed with water and One Condition. I have fine, high porosity,  2b-3a curls. My hair loves protein! I keep the bottle of this stuff in my shower and rake/scrunch it in right after I rinse my conditioner. Then I plop my hair for about 2 minutes and follow up with Arc Angel before diffusing. This product gives me volume and bouncy curls on top. It doesn't have much (if any) frizz control. You need a good gel or styling product if you get frizz. I use about a quarter size of this stuff and my hair is bra strap length.Hope this review helps!

So everyone keeps complaining about it melting but it clearly states on the insert that comes in the box to use the DevaFuser on lowest the heat setting. Also, it will fit a regular blow dryer if you slide the elastic band up. Come on people! Its an awesome product! It does what it says it will do!

I would have given it 5 stars if the green rubber band that holds it on the dryer had not snapped after using only a few times, rendering it useless, since it no longer stays attached to my dryer. For the price, it should last indefinitely or at least come with an extra band and a way to order more when needed. Thank you to Amazon customer service for working with me on the issue, and issuing a refund for this item.

...but as a hairstylist I own different hairdryers.  The BioIonic, T3, Instyler and GemForce.  It fit very easily on my BioIonic and GemForce.  I loved how my client's hair turned out.  The DevaCurl Devafuser hand cradled her curls nicely while drying.  Then I decided to retry to fit it on my Instyler and T3 which has 2"" size nozzles.  I stretched the base of the DevaCurl Devafuser and I finally got it to fit.  It's like a brand new pair of shoes, it just needs to be stretched a bit.  What I really like is the rubber stretch grip on the bottom.  Whereas my other diffusers would come out during a styling service, this rubber grip stays put.  So far so good.  I first saw this at Ulta for $50 but Amazon has the best price.  You'll be ahead of your peers and you'll get lots of other clients turning their heads to look at your cool gadget.  Very happy with my purchase!

Do not waste your money!! This one does not work nearly as well as the round diffuser. It took twice as long to dry my hair. Spend your money on a good hair dryer and a circular diffuser!! I was so excited when it arrived, but was quickly let down..
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I like it, it works well. It freaked my family members out when I first got it as it looks like a hand but tis cool. Honestly I barely use it cuz blow drying my hair is a lot of work but when I do this is a good product. ( I saw Zendaya using this in a vid btw). It lost a star because I had to my a whole other blow dryer because the neck of my old hair dryer was too big for the defuser to fit on which was annoying. So know this does not fit on all hair dryers, if your hairdryer has a thin ""neck"" to it then u should be good. If not then this thing will just keep slipping off every 10 seconds.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Great packaging, love the results when i diffused. I got 2 one for me and my Bff. Took time to learn tricks, I usually let my 3b curls air dry between 30min-1 hour after applying product to wet hairPlus scrunching and then diffuse, less frizz and allows product to penetrate also curls take their shape. Recommend Revlon Rvdr5029 1875watt hair dryer. Yes it fits. Follow directions in box. Recommend it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Sure. It was easy to use. But my old basic cup diffuser thing that came with my old hair dryer makes gorgeous curls and this... did .. not. I had visions of bouncy perfect curls from this hand shaped diffuser that would scrunch and dry and lift all at the same time, but it was sort of difficult to get used to and the ends of my hair would get tangled and sucked into that dryer intake and the end result was fluffy hair with no defined curls or waves and honestly felt like it took way longer than usual to dry. Did not work for me.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I liked the idea of this diffuser,  but it would not fit on any of my hairdryers. Apparently,  you need their hairdryer and I  couldn't justify the cost when I already have 2 perfectly good hairdryers plus a travel hairdryer; so back it went.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I have curly/ wavy hair that is always difficult to dry. The devaCurl attachment was amazing except the glue starts to melt at the high heat setting on my hairdryer. Then my conair dryer broke and I bought a new conair but the attachment doesn't fit so I don't really use it. It's great for getting into my hair to dry it but the glue holding the sides together for sure melts
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Although the description of this product states it fits any hairdryer - it does not. I come with a stretchy band to attach it to the hairdryer. This was very hard to use and took quite some doing to get the band to stretch to fit around my normal size hairdryer. I had to get an extra set of hands to do this. After using it the first few times it stretched out and was easier to use. Then after using it less than a dozen times the green stretchy band broke. Now there is no way to attach it to my hair dryer. It was a total waste of money. My cheaper hair diffuser worked just as well if not better and is much easier to use and connect to my dryer.

Like how it completes the job. My curls have volume and bounce. The product is not a product that will last. I have had it for three weeks and it has broken. Cannot return it because I already desposed of the box. Not happy with the product and the process to get to the final results.  It doesn’t fit well, I constantly have to push the attachment down while diffusing. This helps avoid the band to melt and the air flow to escape. Wish I could get my money back so I can buy another diffuser.

I LOVE THIS CURL-FUSER!!! I DID NOT PURCHASE IT WITH THE DEVACURL HAIR BLOW DRYER I THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO OVER PRICED. BUT IT TOTALLY WORKS WITH ANY UNIVERSAL HAIR BLOW DRYERS AND & DOES THE JOB 100%!!! OVERALL EASY TO USE, WORKS WONDERS AND I LOVE THE RESULTS!

DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I really like the idea of this, It doesn't fit my hair dryer. I was so excited to receive it and when I put it on my chi hair dryer, it kept sliding off. I did order a knock off one for $3.00. It looks like it has a bigger connector. (Fingers crossed), I  really had to rig this Devafuser, currently it is velcroed and duck taped. I was determined, haha. I do like what results I did get though.

DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was very disappointed in this product and found it to be a waste of money.  The product advertises it's ""universal fit"" for MOST commercial hair dryers.  I wanted this product to help me blow dry my hair without taking out my waves, and help me enhance them.  but it popped right off my average size hair dryer that the majority of people have.  I then asked my roommates if I could borrow their hairdryers, thinking it must just be mine...IT DID NOT FIT ON ANY OF THEIRS EITHER.  Unbelievable.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Fantastic. Gently lift and dry the crown and then cup the curls in the “hand.” No more going to work with wet hair! And curls stay bouncy, not frizzy. I have no idea how people are melting this in some of the reviews. You are never supposed to blast curls with high heat. I have one for home, one for the gym, and now I’m getting one for my curly girl mum!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I used the diffuser once and it's completely deformed. I didn't even get to finish my hair. ☹️
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I would not recommend buying this product for serveral reasons.First being that assembly onto a standard blow dryer is a nightmare. The rubber ring that comes with it is supposed to secure the attachment on your dryer, but in fact it’s almost impossible to get on. Once I had finally secured mine, it broke off 3 uses later.Second, the attachment is very flimsy when using with a regular dryer.I’ve had mine for 2 months now and have used it maybe 4 times, and am actually trying to find something else to replace it with.Quality is poor, and for that price unacceptable.I would recommend buying the knockoff for $3, at least when that breaks you won’t feel so bad and can replace it easier.

DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Yolanda’s review: I’m sure how this is supposed to work but I like it. It fits on both my blow dryers and is a real conversation piece; who knew?
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I don’t know what I’d do without my devacurl diffuser!!!! I would have ugly frizzy hair, that’s for sure. The way this thing is designed may make it look a little scary, but trust me, it’s the bomb. When you hold your hair in the hand-like grip, it helps push the curls up and gives them volume.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Ok, so it looks crazy but it is really a smart design. I thought it would be a bit larger, but maybe I have a big head.The air is distributed in so many areas that it dries faster. And it circulates so well it infuses air into the curls. I love it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not sure why, but this very highly praised diffuser attachment really disappointed me. The air doesn't seem to actually reach my hair, which takes forever to dry anyway. Nothing special about this IMO. I've since purchased the Curlyco diffuser and really love it and get the results I was looking for. Another thing is everyone who sees this gives me the side-eye and says ""what the heck is that?!"". Another comment I got was, ""it looks creepy"". LOL! No shade to those that love it, though, just didn't work out for me.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I would recommend this product for every curly hair . Lightweight, easy to use, and dries my hair like no other tool . I spend 20 minutes maximum drying my hair with Devafuser .  Not to forget the gorgeous curls it creates!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I bought this for my daughter because she saw it in a Zendaya’s video, and at the same time I bought another dryer for me, at the end I kept this. Is amazing and worth every penny, if you are looking for an excellent tool for wavy or curly hair this is it, look no more. My only complaint is that it takes time for understand how to connect to my old hair dryer but after you got it this has the work done divinely.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I really, really, really dislike this diffuser and hate that I spent so much on it.  I find it difficult to ""wield"" and it just doesn't dry my hair, even at the roots where I wanted to use it to try to get some lift on top.  Perhaps it is a problem with the user (me) but I much prefer the cup kind of diffuser and can't recommend this one at all.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I didn’t not like this devafuser, although the it has the deva curl name attached to it, it doesn’t even fit the devadryer!! I would not recommend anyone to by this product!! I am a huge deva curl fan it has totally transformed my curls!! However if you are considering buying this devafuser just break open the bank and buy the dryer and defuser!! I am so disappointed in this product!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I hate this diffuser- I have 3 blow dryers and this diffuser does not fit on any of them. I had to rig something to try and make it fit because I spent$30 plus dollars on this thing - so I used duct tape. It worked for the moment. But the diffuser is crap. I get nothing but FRIZZ with this diffuser. Don’t waste your money on anything deva curl. Their products don’t work for me- ever.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Was super excited to try this diffuser and have never been able to, sadly. I tried 5 different blow dryers and wasn't able to get it on a single one. I dont understand what the issue has been, but I spent a nice little chunk of change on something that's still sitting in the packaging in my bathroom cabinet 😔
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love this with the one exception that it slides off a million times while you’re trying to use it. Because you’re using it with a blow dryer it gets hot and it burns if you try to put it back on the blow dryer. My curls have never looked so good but that’s super annoying.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Doesn't fit, despite my blow dryer having a barrel circumference of 6.5 inches.  Even if I jam it on, the only thing keeping it there is a glorified rubber band.  It's not a tight seal, and so much air comes out the sides that hardly any air comes out of the actual diffuser.  This is getting returned.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I prefer a regular defuser because it is easier and faster. The devacurl fits fine on my hairdryer and the fingers are nice for lifting underneath curl sections and drying from two directions.  It is good quality but I gave it a three star because I don't use it. I procrastinated returning it thinking I would get used to it.  Once I figured out How to use it for my short hair I stopped using it because it took so much more time and the results were not significantly different then my old defuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The dryer has a cool concept, but 2 major problems:1) It is NOT universal. I have a standard sized blow dryer and it keeps popping off. Absolutely do not buy unless you have a small, super long nozzle.2) It cannot tolerate high heat. Which means that it takes forever to dry actually super curly hair since you can't go above low heat. The point of buying it was to DECREASE blow drying time and it has failed that test.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Ok, so it did not fit on my blow dryer, my dryer has a wider end.. So I need to buy a new blow dryer which I'm not totally thrilled about. I did try it.. but I had to hold it on my blow dryer as it wouldn't stay on.It did a pretty good job, I didn't dry my hair as long as I would have liked since it was hard to hold it on. I will update my review after I get a new dryer and try it out a few times.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I can't get this on my blo dryer, no matter how hard I try!!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It was just okay. Having the hand in the end as the diffuser didn’t seem to make that big of a difference to drying and in fact, was a little cumbersome
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This did not fit any of my current hair dryers, no matter how hard I pushed it on the end of nozzle. So, half of the drying power escapes before it reaches the end of the “hand”. Unfortunately, I waited too long to try it out, as I received it right before going on vacation, and am not able to return for a refund.Oh well. $50 down the drain.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It's ok if you can find a hair dryer it actually fits. However, I think I have more success with the basic diffuser my cheap hair dryer came with. I bought it hoping I could use it traveling, since it's supposed to be universal, but it definitely doesn't fit usual hotel hair dryers. I think on my trip, it maybe fit 1 out of about 10.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Do not waster your money on this device.  Could never properly use it because it would not stay on the hairdryer.  If you managed to slip it on it slipped right off.  The band that holds it on to the dryer broke and  now the device is useless.  What a waste of money!  I selected one star only because my review would not submit without a star rating.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Please do not purchase Devacurl products!! Many people report losing hair and complete damage to their hair. I unfortunately purchased many Devacurl products prior to making the connection with my scalp issues and have suffered from intense scalp issues and hair loss. There is a class action lawsuit with this company.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Disappointed. Does not stay on my blow dryer
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I hate this thing.  It's a waste of time.  I'm better off blowing with a regular blow dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Product broke after minimal use and I was I was apparently out of range for refund or replacement.  The rubber band that holds it to the blow dryer broke.  I don't recommend this product.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works very well even on long and thick hair gets underneath very well and dries faster

I find a regular difuser easier to use

Was having a problem with my curly hair and this has really helped
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Altered review!  I found a hairdryer to finally fit it!  I LOVE this diffuser!Love the function, but the fact that I can't find a hairdryer to attach it to is a letdown!  I have looked and looked... all the newer hairdryers have a much bigger barrel, and this won't fit.  :-(  I just hold it in place... which is tricky, and gets hot!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Great idea but did not fit on any of my blow dryers. Revlon travel, regular size, and Chi. Had to return and purchased a new system for $144.00. The entire system works great
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The only reason I gave this lower rating was because I’ve had a hard time finding a blowdryer that fits it. The more budget-friendly dryers don’t fit. Otherwise I like it a lot
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Use it for my hair to Keep kinky curly
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
it works great but does not fit any blow dryer only the one sold with like they said it would fit any dryer that is the only thing don't wont to pay over a 100.00 for a blow dryer
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This really does create soft, tousled curls.  What I really love about it is that it gives great lift at the scalp without ruining the curl structure.  It gives a perfect amount of heat and air movement.  It will fit over just about any blow dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I anxiously awaited this product as  my curly hair is short but I am growing it out.  I have tried many diffusers depending on whether I wear my hair short or curly.  I had high hopes for this one as I love the Deva styling products.  Unfortunately, I  struggled and struggled to get this to fit my Compact Vidal Sassoon dryer and no matter how I tried to attach it...it always flew off.  I do not want to purchase another dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This fit snug on my basic blower. My curls look fantastic and I love to use this directly on my roots or while bunching up my hair.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Ridiculous.  Had to try it to know I had no use for it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I found this unique diffuser while searching for a replacement diffuser for mine that had just died. I didn't see instructions included in the ad, so I purchased kind of blindly. Up until this product, I've only ever seen/known diffusers that are bowl or flat shaped but circular.I've had this product now about 2 weeks, and my fluency with the product may get better. If my results change drastically with time, I will update my review. My review is based upon my hair, which is naturally neither straight nor curly, but frizzy and puffy - very afro like without correct product & maintenance (currently use Ouidad for frizz & Kinky Kurly for curl).What I can say now, though, is this product definitely increases volume of my hair - and does this without impacting my hair's natural propensity to frizz. It does not, however, provide as much of a curl as the cup shaped diffusers, do. This may or may not be due to my use of the product, but the fact is that my hair curls more when placed in a curl type position while slowly drying, which the cup shaped diffuser naturally does. Using this hand shaped diffuser doesn't quite capture my hair in the same manner as the cup, but rather dries a wider area of hair. The fingers get the air into deeper parts of my scalp & thusly provides more fullness (as areas not normally reached by the air in a cup diffuser wouldn't get the impact that this product does by having finger-type thingies that pierce deeper).As for instructions - there weren't any detailed provided on the box, either, and were no instruction booklets. There were only a few pictures with key words next to the pictures posted on the actual box. For this reason, I leave my review open to interpretation (given the possibility of my not using the device to its fullest extent). As far as my understanding of this product, however, you used this attachment to your dryer as another hand. It took me awhile to get used to it - but I think I'm getting better now by scooping larger portions of my hair up with my non-blowdryer-holding-hand to position into this hand-type diffuser. This puts my hair moderately into the shape of a natural curl while drying and provides more curl than just using the diffuser as is. While doing this, the finger-thingies still dry area beyond the scrunched up hair - hence more fullness.I have tried my cup shaped diffuser since purchasing this, to confirm my impression that this device (while increasing fullness without adding frizziness, & providing minimal curl definition - more of a wave) didn't create as much of a curly-curl to my hair. I was correct, and the cup type diffuser did in fact provide thicker CURLS. That being said, the result with a cup shaped diffuser didn't reach the inner scalp area of my hair as this diffuser did, so the bigger curls just drop and hang (whereas with this device the minimal curls created do extend further out, as the diffusion goes straight to the scalp - explaining the full results).I anticipate my results will improve with time and fluidity of my hands/head while using this product. It may provide deeper curls if used differently, as there were approximately 4 different ways to use it depicted on the box. I can't figure out any other way to use this on my own, at least not significant differences outside tilting my head one way versus another. For this reason, this device may become better over time. As it currently stands, I'm alternating between my cup-shaped diffuser and this one.

Have owned for over a year, and it is awesome for curly hair like mine! I had to find a blow dryer it fit with, but that took all of 15 minutes at Target. Great product!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I had trouble attaching it to my hair dryer. Because the elasticity of the band is so strong and tight I was afraid I was going to break it. But I pushed it on and it fit nice and snug.I used it on my twist out and it dried it well with very minimal frizz. I really like this product
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love it. I have had no issues and it really dries my hair quickly and with no friz.
"

Melted! I did use it on high setting because nothing at all seemed to come out on the low setting. I am just glad that it melted within the 30 days return period rather than gradually over time.

Great product and buy.  Fit perfectly and true to description and picture.

The band that holds the devafuser to my hair dryer split as soon as I put it on. Unfortunately I will need to replace that part soon. But it is brilliant in how it works!
"

Melted on the first use. I gave feedback in the first week.  Now they won't take it back. I loved it when my hairdresser used it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Like it so far.. but wish it fit every dryer,, i had to buy another dryer just to try it hehe.. but over all i think its adding volume to my hair and making it look nice overall. will continue to use it to see more results.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
If I could give this 0 stars I would. I love the Deva Curl products and was so excited to get this defuser to make my curls even better. The first time I used the defuser (on low heat and low power) it melted within the first 3 minutes. You can see in the picture where the plastic began to separate on the ""finger"" and melted through on the lower left side. I had to check my hair for melted plastic.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
After I finally got it to fit over my blow dryer, it immediately came off once I started using it.  I have never been able to use it successfully. Poorly designed in my opinion.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Let me start by saying I've tried many different diffusers before this one. I have 3c/4a, very fine/flat curls. Normally when I diffuse, my hair is left a frizzy mess. I've resorted to sitting under a hooded dryer to avoid frizz. But then my hair dries super flat and weird.Not with the DevaFuser! I attach it to my blow dryer from another brand. It fits perfectly. My hair dries in record time, with little to no frizz. I even have some volume on day 1! I am really impressed. Give it a try. I hope it works just as well for you.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Great tool that works well but incredibly difficult to find a blow drier to fit it on to! Had to search for one with the smallest diameter nozzle I could find.  That was really annoying. It took me months!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Even though it doesn't make any sense I am amazed at the great results I get from this product!  I am more than happy with the results & highly recommend it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Wasn't sure about this odd shaped diffuser at first but it does a good job.  It works like a hand scrunching up your hair as you dry it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I have to say I LOVE Deva products...but this one, for me,  just doesn't cut it!I get much fuller curls with a regular diffuser on my regular old hair dryer.I'll be fair and say my type of curl is S(wavy) so maybe this works better on a tighter curl.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I first heard about this product from my hair stylist. She has curly hair just like me and even though I air-dry my hair during summer (I live in New York), I need to blow dry it during winter so I do not get sick. So I asked her what can I do during winter to dry my hair and get that va-va-voom curls without the frizz. She grabbed this oddly shaped item (the old version which has a square bottom not elastic). I thought this was just some weird sculpture they had but boy, was I wrong. She told me she has one at home as well as all the products form DevaCurl line and they're great for curly hair. After I got my haircut, she demonstrated on me. I was blown away (ha ha get it?). Anyway, she put a handful of mousse for my full head and gave it a slight scrunch and lifted it using this. At then end, using one of the fingers, she grabbed a few curls and separated my hair in the front and I felt like I just got a make-over. It was one of those ""SEXY"" hair moments and the result you see on the covers of the curly hair products and ads. So, I went home, went on Amazon, bought it right away. I use it with hair creams, lotions and milks . It works amazingly. If you have curly hair, get ready to feel like a million bucks.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
According to the description this product fits most blow dryers on the market.  It didn't fit either of my dryers.  Had to return it without even getting to try it out.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The diffuser piece keeps popping off of my dryer while I'm doing my hair. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This is a very effective diffuser, because it can sit inside the hair instead of just pushing from the ends.  Do you have thick hair?  You know how your ends get dry but the whole interior of your hair is still wet?  This fixes that problem.  It fit onto my regular blow dryer, I use high heat and low air.  It also works to introduce a little more volume because you lift the hair as it dries, this sort of stretches the roots so they don't curl up right onto your scalp.  It does both the job of a regular diffuser (press up from the ends) and drying and lifting the roots/inside part of hair (stick the ""fingers"" into your hair and lift up).  It blows hot air from both sides, not just the palm side, so the hair drys faster, too.  I don't have the kind of hair that gets all the way dry with a diffuser, and this one doesn't do it either, but it gets me to the 75% dry faster than a regular one, and MUCH more evenly dry.Yes it is big and awkward, but I find it gives my hair (thick-ish, coarse and wavy/curly, slow to get wet and slow to dry) much better results because it can dry the inside hair, instead of just drying the ends and outsides.  And can do this without much disruption to the curls.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
After rave reviews I purchased this but was a bit disappointed...I actually prefer my circular diffuser much more
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
At first I didn’t know how to attach it to my blow dryer, but I later realized that it didn’t actually fit on the dryer. So I took the green band off & kind of forced it on. It works beautifully now.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love my diffuser. Perfect for curly hair.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was really looking forward to my DevaCurl DevaFuser as my hair dresser uses it and I was always impressed. After several weeks of using it daily, the diffuser began to melt and become deformed. After two months it is to the point where I can no longer use it as the plastic begins to liquefy when it is on my blow dryer. I do no understand why something intended to go on a hot blow dryer would me made out of plastic that melts at those temperatures. The concept is great, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I've only used it once but it worked great. It doesn't leave curly hair as frizzy as with regular difusers.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I actually like the  way the air flows thru, but I have to use both hands to keep it from sliding off my travel blow dryer. It is too narrow to fit on my regular one.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Spouse says it it excellent, how can I argue with that....
"

Nothing special honestly. Don't ways your money. A regular diffuser will do the same job if not better with my experience
"

This is the best diffuser I’ve used for my type 2b waves. Takes a little bit longer to dry my hair (just past my shoulders and very thick) but well worth it for the end result.

This is not Universal. Will not fit my standard Conair hairdryer. Bummed. My hairdresser uses this and I love it but I can’t find an ‘everyday’ hairdryer that it fits. It’ll b going back
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not sure yet how I feel about it because I haven't had a chance to use it. When I try to attach it to my dryer, it feels like it's going to break. Like it's too small! I know the band around it stretches, but I'm worried I'll break it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The band broke in less than a month, without it, it just keeps popping off like other ""universal"" diffusers. Of course it's now over the return period. They should include a few replacement bands at least.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Terrible, arrived in the product box but in nothing but a cushioned manilla envelope. The diffuser itself looked as though it had been melted. Completely damaged.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I REALLY wanted this. But it does not fit on my dryer. So it sits unused in the box. I'd love a return...
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I can not live without this! This was my second and the rubber band has held up fine but the fingers are not lined up like they were when I first got it. This doesn't effect its performance but if it shifted much more I could see it possibly pulling som hairs.

How disappointed I am that the Deva diffuser does NOT fit my hairdryer.  I was very excited to buy one after my stylist used one to do my hair. She did mention that the hairdryer and diffuser were sold together.  I am not paying for an expensive hair dryer so what shall I do? The attaching tube is extremely narrow and does not fit on my hairdryer or my husband's!Jody

Love this diffuser!! It fits all hairdryers, It makes it so easy to dry curly hair!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I didn't think that this would be easy to use but I was surprised that it actually is.  It dried the hair close to my scalp without frizzing the rest.  This is my go to diffuser from now on.

Removed all of my curl immediately. May work for really strong curls but for light waves forget it unless you want straight hair.

"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
i wanted to LOVE this produce and am always down for trying a curly hair product.  i had such high hopes.  I fully knew i'd probably have to buy a new hairdryers, which i did.  at least one that kinda fit this guy, and i fully expected it to be ackward until i got used to it.  i never quite bonded with it after using it for a week.My ""bowl"" diffuser (which came with the NEW hairdryer i purchased to work with this product) thankfully works great.  This product IS helpful if you have trouble drying underneath your hair, and IF your hair is shorter.  Mine is longer so it did not help me much.  i would NOT recommend and it does NOT fit MOST hairdryers, like the reviews say - the opening is VERY small.  it's an interesting item, and i continue to TRY to use it, but still go back to my bowl diffuser.I did not hate it, but it's not my go-to attachment either.

Bueno
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
No enough air goes through the holes.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This is way to large to handle.  I didn't clearly notice the dimensions and had a mental picture. Too much to handle, especially for medium length hair.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
my wife loves this
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works as expected.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It looks like an alien hand but is great for diffusing curly hair - you can direct the airflow from inside the hair instead of trying to dry from the outside in.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Loveeeeee this diffuser!!! So glad i brought it on here for the better deal!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
My hair dryer is within the size mentioned but this didn't even come close to fitting.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I think it is a great idea, but I can't get it to stay on my blow dryer.  I have the Conair 1875 and read a review that stated it fit perfectly.  I get it on, but it shoots off of the blow dryer after a couple minutes of use.  Very disappointed.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love it. Works great! No issues at all with it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not a fan of this--I'd prefer the regular round diffusers that most hair-dryers come with. But I do LOVE the DevaCurl no-poo shampoo, conditioner, and hair products!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It was missing the piece that holds it on the hair dryer. It’s useless without it. Doesn’t stay on.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works great! I love that it’s universal so I can use it on my hairdryer instead of going and spending big $ on the deva dryer. Definitely worth it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
do not recommend - more of a gadget than a useful product
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Doesn't fit my dryer, I already have returned two dryers I purchased! I do not want to invest the money in the Deva dryer until I try the devafuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This diffuser kept my curls/coils intact! When I was initially trying to attach it on my dryer I thought it wasn't going to fit but the attachment actually stretches enough and is very snug on my hand held blow dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
""Universal"" was still too small for my dryer
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It doesn’t always stay on my hair dryer, but it definitely dries my hair well and at the root without extra frizz.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Still learning how to use this but so far it's good not meant to use with hot setting!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love how the ""fingers"" can get under the layers of my hair. Best diffuser I've used. Cheaper ones have made my hair frizzy.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Short and to the point. I have thick, curly hair and it made my curls look sloppy and frizzy. Would not recommend.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Didn't work on blow dryer easy to return
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Didn't work for me.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I have gone through at least 4 of these trying to ""get one that lasts & works"".It melts, cracks & eventually just falls apart. In theory, it is an appealing design but in actuality - it fails!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love the Deva Diffuser. It works great for my medium/ long curls and dries fast even on cool setting. It fits my much older model baby bliss no problem.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It states that it ""fits most hair dryers"" however  it didn't fit the one I have .  I tried 6 different dryers at a local store just to find ONE that fit.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Terrible design. You need a blow dryer with a long nozzle, do not waste your money otherwise
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love this it puts other defuses 2 shame
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Thanks..! nice and handy..! but don't  used in high hot speed remember plastic melt...! Be Careful..!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It works great for drying your roots first and leaving less friz.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Best diffuser I've ever owned and I've tried about 6 million different ones before springing for this one.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
If you have naturally curly hair this will be your new best friend.  Got it at a great price! No frizz!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I don't know as I gave as a gift and did not se this product myself
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The comcept of this diffuser looked amazing to me, I though it will be the end of my head hanging down to dry my hair, but that is not the case. It has taken me a wile to get dissent  results . Overal I think this product at three times more expensive is not woth the money.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It doesn't fit my hair dryer, so now I have a diffuser I can't use. I can't find a way to buy the deva hair dryer without the diffuser, nor can I find a list of compatible hair dryers. Really, really frustrating!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Great product
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Super cool works great in the middle of my hair as well on the out sides. It's a little bulky but a great product
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I have loose curly hair and this defuser gives me great volume and less frizz compared to a flat defuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Mine didn't come with that bottom flare piece!Can't use, won't fit on any blower.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
i wish i had been warned that this would not fit my blow dryer before i bought it! i cant find a place to buy the blow dryer separately either.  all the devacurl blow dryers i am seeing are super expensive and include this diffuser.  they should definitely make this diffuser more compatible with other brands or warn you that the elastic band is not stretchy AT ALL. i feel like i wasted my money :-(
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Worked pretty well. But the rubber section broke after a few uses. Says universal, but that’s a stretch. Literally.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Cute idea but not enough air flow and awkward to use.  I used a few times and went back to my diffuser dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not quite as I had expected. The fingers do not seem curled enough to get in and under your hsir.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Doesn't fit on my hair at all well
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Really love it. Fit my dryer perfectly. My curls look so different than the did with other diffusers, less frizzy, more natural.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This natural design helps keep my hair from getting frizzy.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
band on the dryer broke after about a month.  now it won't stay on the hair dryer and is in effective useless.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Made my naturally curly hair more frizzy. A regular diffuser worked much better. Think it would work best if someone else was drying your hair with this product, as it was a bit cumbersome to manipulate.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
If you have any natural curl to your hair then this is the diffuser for you.  I can't believe how amazingly curly this diffuser makes my hair.  I Love, Love, Love it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
If you do chose to put this diffuser on another hair-dryer (vs. buying the full DC hair dryer,) it is absolutely crucial that you use only on the COLD setting. This is of course assuming that you are using all Deva-Curl products as well!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Different, but it works!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Arrived as promised and on time. The problem is that it does not stay attached to my professional Babyliss Pro V1 Volare  Hair Dryer. It slips off.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I absolutely love this, makes my hair really full!!  Fits on most blow dryers.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Gets into the roots with out making everything frizzy but difficult to get and keep on regular sized blow dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love this defuser!  I never used a blow dryer in the past because my hear would frizz. No frizz with this defuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Really didn't see any improvement over my regular defuser. In fact a little worse, as when you stick it under/inside your hair it just blows the canopy into a frizz... I'm returning it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Thought I would use it alot, but I don't.. Hair looks better when I let it air dry.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
it didn't really fit my blow-dryer, but I still manage to make it fit a little bit.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love this, I had one of the original ones and it broke and didn't hesitate to order a new one. I love the new design and how I don't have to go out in the cold Maine winters with wet curly hair.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not easy to use.  Hair slides off of it when trying to dry.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
i went to a hair stylist that used it on my hair and pointed out so many benefits to having this diffuser.  my problem with it is that it says it fits most blow dryers. Not True. i have 2 dryers in my home and it kept popping off, i took it to the store to find a dryer that it would fit and the ones with the narrow barrel cost around $100. So i thought that if I'm going to spend that much money, i might as well get the Deva dryer & diffuser kit. I mailed the devafuser back at a loss (I paid shipping to return it).. I have since purchased the dryer/ diffuser combo kit. No problems with fit. The dryer is truly a high quality product, it drys my hair quickly, and my hair feels and looks beautiful. Don't waste your time with this devafuser hand. Get the combo set
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love how it works the curls....Hate the design.  It's getting ready to fall apart.  As much as these things cost they should have a better design.It's not the oversized rubber band that is the issue - It's the frail plastic pieces inside the rubber band that are obviously not made for heat from a hair dryer.  They have warped and are wearing.  I had to buy a different hair dryer because it's to the point if I remover the diffuser one more time I won't be able to get it back on the hair dryer or it's going to break.  That is an inconvenience...Hopefully they will re-work their design and/or drop their prices.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I don't think it did any better job than my regular diffuser.  I ended up returning it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This diffuser is terrible. Just use a regular diffuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
So dissapointed with my order! Looks nothing like the devafuser. The hand is all twisted and looks deformed and looks absolutely smaller than anticipated! Thats what happens when you try to save a few bucks. My advice.. Stick to ORIGINAL! This is not original... AT ALL!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Great item
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
My hair has been changing from straight to wavy for the past couple of years, and I had no idea what to do with it, as with the slightest humidity would become frizzy.I had been reading about DevaCurl and thought of giving it a try, buying the fuser which I use with my old hair dryer. Nailed it! It's so easy to use, I can blow dry my hair without the frizziness or the need to use any other tool. As long as I don't mess with it afterwards, it remains wavy for the rest of the day. I had my doubts because many people complained about the fuser melting, well, that did not happen with my old con air dryer. I would definitely recommend this product.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
this does not fit my blow dryer
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Though I have a full head of curly hair, I always hated using defusers with my hairdryer. They are bulky, they take so much time and they just are hard to maneuver. This DevaCurl one though is easier for me to maneuver and now that I got it, I am constantly using it.  I love that it feels like a hand and I can position it the way I would my hand and scrunch the hear and hold it in a certain position as it drys.  I like it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Great for drying  curly hair without messing it up.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Gives great body!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Over priced!! Takes too long to dry your curls. A round defuser works much better!! Disappointed!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I can't imagine this fitting on any hair dryer.  The opening is so small! I have to return.  Unfortunately I couldn't even test the product to see if I like the results.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Does not fit most hairdryers.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Was difficult to find dryer that it would fit.Also,not good unless your hair is at least shoulder length. Could not use it on my shorter cut curls.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This product is falsely advertised as it does but fit regular hair dryers.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Amazing product!  Works just as described.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Don't buy this. As a user of DevaCurl products for over a year - I was excited to try this since all their products are amazeballs. This, however, sucketh. Left my hair LESS curly and not as much volume as I get with my regular diffuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This will not fit 2 different dryers I have. It is supposed to be universal, and you can't purchase the dryer to this separate.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Its fun and it works great!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Arrived quickly, and looked like it was supposed to. However, it was too small, and didn't fit my hairdryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I bought this item for my nieces birthday..she raves at how great this product works..
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I am unable to return it as i crossed the 30 day timeline - but this diffuser does not fit well also started melting. eventually even broke
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I've used round diffusers for years, so when I saw this, I thought it would be fun and interesting to try something different.  Sorry, but compared to a traditional round diffuser, for me, this gadget is a joke.  Perhaps I didn't use it correctly, so I gave it an extra star just in case I'm the culprit.  But it deserves a single star in my book.  I returned it and happily returned to my old, round diffuser.  Sometimes the next bright, shiny object is just that.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love love love ...my hair is so much shinier and bouncy
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
i love it it is a good productthank you for it I will recommend it to my friend .
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Adds volume...curls dry soft and cute
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It's ok doesn't stay on nothing that a good old  fashion  diffuser could do.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Just perfect
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Best tool for curly hair I've ever had ..!!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works well. Fits fine on dryer. No problems
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Helps my hair curl beautifully
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Does not fit on the typica blow dryer so sucks
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The original ""hand"" fit any hair dryer with the attachment.  This one is still in the box because I can't find a reasonably priced hairdryer with a small enough shaft for the hand to actually go on.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Returning .disappointed. is not a universal fir as stated..
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love it
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I too was unable to get the attachment to fit. It fit over the dryer but did not stay in place.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Didn’t fit on either of my hairdryers. The elastic band kept sliding it off. Very disappointed.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Great product but unfortunately did not fit my Conair Infiniti Pro 2000 hair dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Helps reduce frizz
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I prefer the regular diffuser, I would've returned it but didn't have the time
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
An added note:  works perfectly on my Babyliss folding travel dryer.received this a few weeks ago and I love it.  I have medium curly, fine, chin length hair and it works great for me.  Use it near the scalp on low for some lift and volume, plus use it to ""cradle"" top, sides and back to finish drying process.  I really did have more, bouncier curls when used with the right producs for my hair type.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love this attachment! I have very curly hair and I can now go out with a dry head with no frizz!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This DevaFuser didn't do anything remarkable enough to justify the price. I was surprised as their products are generally very good.  Disappointed with the results, I passed it along to my Sister.  My Sis followed the instructions and watched the Youtube instructional vids, to no avail. We've both had better results,  when in a pinch and we used a sock at the end of the hair dryer! Note: the sock can cause the dryer to overheat.  Save your money and buy a regular diffuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Unfortunately this diffuser, which looks like a great design does is not actually made to fit 'most dryers.'  I have yet to find a list of dryers this diffuser fits on.  Strangely, the box does not contain any instructions on how they suggest getting it on. Most reviewers discuss how hard it is to put on their dryer!  I'm going to try to get a babyblisspro dryer, as one person mentioned it fit. But pretty disappointing generally.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Product is working well but had to find a dryer to fit the small attachment opening.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Fits my revlon dryer well. Great for drying curly hair and adding volume to the roots. Slightly more frizz than using a helmet diffuser, but gets to the undersides of thick hair much easier so faster drying times. And much more portable than a helmet diffuser, of course.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love it
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Did not work as expected. It’s alright.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It started melting the first time I used it! Now one of the fingers is almost completed melted and it gets stuck in my hair ! I would not recommend this to anyone
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I have wavy curly hair.  I recently started using the devacurl line about a month ago.  But my curls were still kind of frizzy and falling flat by the end of the day.  So I thought I would give this hand a try.  First off, it didn't fit on any of the 3 blow dryers I have, so they really shouldn't say it fits ""most"" hairdryers.  But I have one of those Conair round brush blowdryers, and it fit perfectly on that.  I used it this morning, and I am so impressed!  My curls are more spiraly (if that is a word), and there is barely any frizz.  This made such a HUGE difference!  I would highly recommend it, but don't expect it to fit on your blow dryer unless you have one with a really skinny nozzle.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Gives my hair curls and volume, and no frizz
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Okay, this turned out to be a long overdue purchase, but I'm glad I finally bought it.  Use it on my hairdryer, regardless of some reviews saying it melted.  I use mine in Med heat only but use the power on high.  It take a little elbow grease and care when putting the DevaFuser on, just take your time and guide the notches from the rubber band around the sleeve and boom, Happy curls!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love the product, worked on my blow dryer!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Did not fit my standard size blow dryer, so I could not even try it. Sending it back. :(
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love the way it defines my curls. Does away with the frizz and I have gotten a lot of compliments on my hair since I've started using it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It does work well but it doesn't stay on my blow dryer all that well. So, it's a little awkward to use.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was apprehensive about buying this, but it works great.  I read al of the reviews and learned from them.  I don't use high heat and I've had no problems after at least a month of use.  Works great and quickly in drying my wavy/curly hair.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Didn't fit my blow dryer well. Only fits perfectly if you purchase the DevaCurl blow dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I do not like how it fits the dryer. I need to be able to adjust the angle of the diffuser without twisting my arm. I wish it fit like the regular diffuser that comes with the Deva hair dryer because you are able to turn the nozzle different ways. The universal diffuser has big rubber grips that make it difficult, and I think turning it while it's on the dryer will ruin it. Puls, it's hard to turn. I also wish more air came out of the ""palm"" of the diffuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I bought mine in April of 2015. After using this defuser on average 4 times a week, two of the nubs that stick out from the rubber band broke in half. The defuser is still usable, but it takes a lot more effort to get it on my blow dryer. There are some cracks above the rubber band that will eventually break then the defuser will be unusable. Since the defuser has become a part of my daily routine, I am repurchasing.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Fit on my ion hairdryer perfectly, I love this product it makes my hair look amazing!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I bought two of these- works great !
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Shape made drying hair easier
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works great. Love the air flow is through the entire piece. Hair dries quicker.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Won't fit my hair dryer which is a tapered barrel. So you would think that it would attach to the barrel at some point, but it does not. I missed the return by date, so I am stuck with this sucker. I did like the product, but I had to hold onto my hairdryer, which was nearly impossible to do while diffusing my hair.  I'm giving it to stars because I think if you had the right kind a hair dryer, it would be a very good product.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It is very difficult first to find a hair blower that this fits, then it does not stay secure on the dryer ....very difficult to use.  Not happy with the limited use of this product.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This is not universal.  It will not stay on my standard hairdryer.  It keeps slipping off when the dryer is on.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
With the right products and this DevaFuser my hair is now back to all its' curly gloryness. Been lazy the last few years and kind of just let the curls go their own way. Now I'm receiving compliments every day. Curly hair girls know to use a diffuser. This is an awesome one.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I had to return it. It did not fit my hair dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I'm not sure if it even works for diffusing hair but I tell you what I'll have an extra hand when I need one~! Lol I Love this diffuser~! I'll repost after I actually use it on my hair~!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
There really isn't anything bad I can say about this product. It is completely different than using a normal diffuser and takes some getting use to. With my traditional diffuser, it dries my hair from the tips to the scalp often leaving my hair flat. With  the DevaCurl, it dries it from the scalp to the tips and adds so much more volume. Getting the tips dry is a challenge, but not a deal breaker for me. There have been complaints about it melting, but I use it on my low heat setting (which still gives plenty of heat) and I have had no issues. I am very happy about this purchase and would recommend it to anyone with curly hair.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I can wrestle this on to my travel sizes Chi Dryer, but it pops off after 5 mins. I honestly don't understand why this is so much better than a regular diffuser. My hair didn't see that much of a difference between the two. I tossed the box before testing (like a genius) so no returns for me :(
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
GRRRRR!!!!!Like so many others, I bought this device, just KNOWING it was the answer to all my granddaughters prayers.  And like so many others I read the reviews, noting that almost all of the many many negative reviews talked about how the device didn't fit over their hair dryers.  But one person said that it didn't fit over her 2 1/2"" dryer mouth but did in fact fit over her 2"" wide dryer ""mouth"".  I measured my dryer and it was 2"" so I ordered this product.  Well guess what??? It doesn't even come CLOSE to fitting my 2"" wide opening!  Now I either have to send the thing back or go try to find a new hair dryer with a very small opening, which means I will have to stand in the store opening all of the different brands of dryers and measuring them with my tape measure.  It also means I will have to buy another hair dryer that I don't need since I already have 2 perfectly good ones.  What a crock!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not any better than a regular diffuser. I was disappointed.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was very excited to purchase this after my stylist used it on my hair. However, when I received it it did not fit my hair dryer. This seems to be common based on the other reviews. I bought a new hair dryer just so I could use this product. It still did not fit well, this time it kept slipping off the dryer. The diffuser has already cracked, although I have been as gentle with it as I can. I think I've sunk enough money into this product. Fair warning!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Way overrated and over priced.  Does not curl as well as our regular diffuser, and you cannot use high heat with it so it takes forever for your hair to dry.  A waste of money!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I expected my curls would look fabulous with this diffuser and they looked like they do with any other diffuser.  I couldn't even keep it on my main dryer, but it did fit on another one I had laying around.  Wasn't impressed.  Returned it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This product was not for me.  Hard to find a dryer it fit (thankfully I have more than one) and tried it once, hated it!  Very bulky to use.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Didn't work like I thought it would. Wish I could give no stars. :((
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
difficult to find the right hair dryer that fits with it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I just received the diffuser attachment yesterday. I love it! It fit my dryer. It is adjustable. I love how this can dry your roots without messing up my curl. It also gave me great volume at the root. I just started to use Devacurl products on my wavy hair and I'm hooked!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Well, it didn't fit on my dryer. I never even got a chance to use it. For whatever reason, the packing slip wasn't included in my purchase either. Hopefully, I'll be able to return it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Unfortunately this diffuser did not fit my hairdryer properly. In addition it is very big, bulky & awkward. Not very easy to use on fine, long hair.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I ordered this over a year ago,  but have only used it maybe 20 times.  It started cracking in the first month.  This morning,  it completely broke. Good for the few times I used it, but not worth the price. I won't be buying again.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was really excited to find out Deva came out with a new DevaFuser. I had the original one which was poorly designed and after having two that broke in only a short period of time broke down and purchased the DevaDryer. Pretty disappointed in the Dryer. I've had it a little over a year and it already has stopped working, for the price it is rather poor quality. I recently got a new hair dryer and purchased this attachment, however it doesn't fit. I have tried it on several and none of them are small enough to accommodate this attachment. Another poor design. Very disappointed because this is the only thing like it on the market and is really great, if it only fit.

I have been waiting over a year for this fuser to come out!!  I like it a lot.  i seem to have less frizz with it.  I would of given it 5 stars if it would of come with directions on how to use it.  I am getting better at it.  If you have curly hair I think you will like this and I do think it will fit on every hairdryer.  Also I have medium short hair.

Boo.... It absolutely did not fit my dryer, no matter how I tried adjusting the elastic band (Revlon 1875W,  model RVDR5175). Frustrating, I had high hopes for it. I found a much cheaper and FAR superior solution in the ""Hot Stock."" Try that before you spend 10x as much on this plastic hand.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I have 2 different hair dryers and it fits neither one. It's also HUGE. Not at all what I expected. I can't say if it works well, couldn't try it, but I certainly was not going to spend nearly $200 on the dryer they say goes with it; although supposedly it fits ""most standard"" hairdryers.

I have owned this product just over a month, used it a handful of times and it melted at the wrist.

If you have curly hair, you have to use DevaCurl products.

This diffuser is bigger than I expected but fits on my T3 hair drier. It's hand shaped design makes it work perfectly with my curls. I am able to get my curls dry without disturbing my curl pattern. It's a real time saver. It also help with building volume without doing damage.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
the salon i go to uses this on my hair and i love it! so i was excited when they started selling just the diffuser, it fits my blow dryer perfect i have an old revlon drying i have had for about 5 years now, very east to put on, the only negative thing i have to say about it is , if you have never used it before it does take some getting used to, so i do reccomend watching youtube videos and things like that, also i will recomment getting the Deva styling prodects as well.

DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
My hair has never looked better, I have fine curly hair, but you would never know it is fine after using this attachment!  I do not know why I did not buy this sooner.  I am using it on my cheap normal hairdryer, I see no reason to buy the Deva dryer.Try it, you will love it!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love it.  My hair dries beautifully with this

"

Wife loves it so far. Says it saves her so much time. Just one thing. Her blow dryer had a short snout or whatever it's called. So we had to get one with a longer one so it can stay on right.

It's just okay.

I was unsure of the fit onto my own dryer! Fit "" like a glove"" ,,very easy to apply to dryer! The airflow is great for my first braidout!! Love this!
"

Works great!!  Adds volume to thin curly hair and dries faster than other diffusers.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I always thought my normal diffuser did a good job but I didn't know what potential my curls had! This amazing thing gave me corkscrew curls all over. I did use the devacurl cream along with it and I never ever had hair like this before and I go to a salon for my hair care. Every girl with curls must have this. I never even knew it existed until last week...where has this been all my life?! Why it isn't sold in every target store is beyond me😊
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works. Definitely speeds the drying process. I bought this attachment for my Revlon RV484 blow dryer. I did measure before I purchased and it was still a tight fit.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not a tool for gals with chin length or shorter hair - have tried really hard to make it work for me and it gets a big, fat fail. Too big, too bulky, too difficult to maneuver. Wish I could return it :(
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love this diffuser and highly recommend for any one with curls!
"

it's ok - i find it makes my hair frizzy.  i'd rather air dry!

Its falling apart and has not even been six months since the purchase.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This is not a universal attachment and does not fit all dryers, the only way i got it to fit my dryer, which is not a big one, was to remove the rubber band, then it slides off the dryer.  Disappointed
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Like many other reviewers, I had to find a hair dryer with a very narrow nozzle to get this to work. I think I could have gotten this diffusor over my original hair dryer but I was leery of how much that stretched the rubber band. Bed Bath to the rescue! The Conair InfinitiPro Salon Performance Hair Dryer worked perfectly.This diffusor is magic. I tend to shower at night, so being able to dry my hair before bed is idea and this diffusor does a better job than any other fast drying method. Love, love, love this diffusor!The only downside is that I keep the diffusor on the hair dryer, which makes storing it a bit tricky.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This is the best blow dryer, regardless of whether you have curly or straight hair! The holes on either side of the ""claw"" as I call it, allow for airflow on both sides, and much faster drying! Do yourself a favor and buy this to speed up your getting ready time in the mornings!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not that thrilled with this diffuser.  I measured my blowers before buying but wouldn't fit either and required purchasing a new dryer. When I was able to use the diffuser it just seemed more like a gimmick than actually helpful to me.  By the time this is attached to the dryer it is pretty bulky to handle.  I have gone back to just letting my hair dry naturally. I suppose if I am in a hurry I will use it but as it must be used on low heat it takes a long time to dry my hair and I don't have thick hair.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I'm glad I waited until this was redesigned to fit on any drier.  When I first opened the box and saw how tiny the opening was I thought for sure I'd have to buy a new dryer, but it really does stretch to fit!  I used it for the first time this morning and I loved it.  I hate going out with wet hair in the winter and now I can dry the hair at my roots before heading out the door.  This gave my hair nice lift off my scalp and the rest of the curls are able to dry quickly with ambient air and they look well-defined.  I don't know about the reviews about the plastic melting, My hair is medium-thick and I used the highest heat setting and had no trouble. I did not dry my hair completely because I prefer the look when it air-dries.  But I was able to dry the roots and that's what I wanted.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Did not fit dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I do love this diffuser. It did a nice job with my curls and fit on my existing hairdryer perfectly. But I prefer the traditional shape of professional diffusers.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
If your hair dryer has a ""fat"" opening, you will struggle to get this on.  I finally got it on, but then one of the screws on the side came undone due to the pressure of how far it had to stretch.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Buyers beware. Product seems official and works wonderfully. Amazon is NOT however, an authorized retailer of DevaCurl products. The elastic band that holds the attachment firm to you dryer MAY pop while in use. There is no replacement band and DevaCurl will NOT be able to help you.

Dries hair nicely without breaking the curl just wish I didn't have to keep checking if it's sliding off my blower.

I was hesitant to purchase this defuser after ready some of the reviews I found online but finally bit the bullet. After using it once I was hooked.  I have tried many defusers over the years but none were even close to thing one. I only wish I knew about it years ago. I also started using the DevaCare hair products which are a little pricey but worth ever penny. My curls looks better than they ever have. I have only used my on the medium setting with low heat and it work great.
"

I have curly hair. This adds volume to the top of my hair which is great. but it does make it frizzy. I have been using 2 different diffuses. I could have done without this product.

Didn't fit my blow dryer and the return label provided does not open. The seller does not respond to my question to get a valid return label.  NO RESPONSE. Now I have to dispute charges.  It's a pain.  I don't recommend it.

a very good product! I am surprised no one has thought of it before!  :)

Best defuser I have used in my one year natural hair journey.  Dried my hair without disturbing the curls created with the Deva microfiber towel.  I did have to remove the band for it to fit my Conair dryer but it does not slip off at all.  This was a great purchase!

"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I go to the Devachan salon regularly to get my hair cut & styled so I'm familiar with this tool, and I know how to use it. Regardless, very disappointed. It's just not made for home use, and Deva is exploiting Curly Girls by selling it. It's next to impossible to find a home dryer it will fit onto, and when I finally did, the diffuser split along one of the side seams anyway. So upsetting. Not that it worked all that well before it split because it didn't. It frizzed my curls and clumped them weirdly. And yes, I used the cool setting and as I said I know how to use it; I've been shown how by the stylists in Deva's salon.Honestly, not worth the overpriced $ they charge, a regular diffuser works better.

"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Bought this relying on advertising claim that is is a ""universal"" attachment that fits ""most"" hairdryers.  Watch out!!  I have three hair dryers at home.  Fits none of them.  I took this one three business trips.  Fits none of the hotel hair dryers.  And I went to several drugstores and beauty supply stores in search of a small barrel hairdryer that this might work with.  No luck there either.  Meanwhile, the return window has closed and I am now stuck with this completely useless piece of green plastic.  Shouldn't have purchased it.  Should have returned it right away instead of searching for a hairdryer to work with it.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE WASTE THEIR TIME WITH THIS PRODUCT.

"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Totally love it!!for curl freaks like me this device makes all the difference !!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I guess I always thought that I just had ""bad"" curls - not the nice, smoothe looking curls/waves I always wanted and then came the DevaFuser.  In all seriousness, I cannot believe the difference in my hair after drying with this device.  It's really exciting for me because being able to wear my hair curly (and not blow it out) saves me so much time and with 22 month old twin boys time is at a premium these days.  I can honestly say that I love my curls when using the DevaFuser to dry them (even more so than air drying).  I've also found that the DevaCurl products make a huge difference too.  As you can tell, I'm definitely a believer.  Highly recommend!Note:  I read other reviewers saying the device didn't fit their hairdryers which definitely may be true of certain models but I, too, thought this didn't fit mine until I realized that I had to push it all the way onto the barrel - it doesn't sit at the end like other diffusers.

excellent for my curly hair but it fit an old hair dryer that I had also it cracked the first time i used it but is still works BEWARE it doesnt fit all dryers
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
So, I haven't used this yet since it doesn't fit either one of my dryers, but my first thought is that, it looks cheap and the plastic looks like it will break easily. Can't believe this was $30.00. Now i have to either send it back,(which I hate), or I have to go on a hunt for a dryer that it will fit and spend more money. I was so excited to get this because i love the concept. Not happy.UPDATE;  so I gave this a bad review because it didn't fit my hairdryer and was mad because i'd have to buy another one. I came close to purchasing one but stopped. Glad i did because i spotted my brush wand dryer that iv'e had forever but never use. Turns out I could remove the brush part by unscrewing the nob at the top leaving just the wand. the diffuser slipped right over it and was able to push it into the hand part. PERFECT! Now I love it. I was even able to position the power button between the tongs. If you don't have one, they're pretty cheep. and it was actually more comfortable to hold it that way for drying versus with a gun style. My hair dried with out blowing it around and got great volume.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I discover Deva products for curly hair a few years ago and cannot live without them.  I've had my eye on the original dryer and diffuser but just did not see myself spending that much for a hair dryer.  Now that its available on its own, I really wanted to try it.  I was also in need of a universal diffuser so I could take with me on travel.First, I was pleased that it fit my hair drying which has a snap on diffuser that is not universal.  Once I turned on the dryer, I was worried there wasn't enough air flow coming out of the attachment, I could barely feel it.  I thought it would take forever for my hair to dry.  (I have shoulder length, deva cut, type 3A curls.)  Was I wrong!  There is a slight learning curve especially trying to figure out how to hold the dryer and position the hand in your hair.  It took about the same amount of time as with a standard diffuser BUT my curls were less frizzy, more defined, and had amazing volume!  I do believe that once I get past the learning curve, my dry time will be faster with this diffuser.  I'm never going to give this up.  Thanks Amazon!

DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
First of all, when I received the Devafuser, it did not fit my blow-drier :(  But I really love all the other DevaCurl products I use regularly: (One Condition, no-poo shampoo,  light defining gel, styling cream, and frizz-free volumizing foam). So I did my research online and measured the nozzle of the diffuser attachment and determined that the nozzle of the blow drier had to be about 1.5"" measured across the nozzle for attachment to fit. So I took my measuring tape with me to Walmart, Target, and then Sally Beauty supply. BINGO at Sally Beauty supply! This is what I got and fits perfectly: Plugged in Ceramic Tourmaline Stow'n Go mini dryer, which cost $19.99. Devafuser slid right on the dryer and stayed put. Took about 15 minutes to dry my shoulder length fine 3B (spirals) hair. I got lift at the roots that was needed and my hair is so soft.

"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I really wanted this product, and overall I love how it made my hair look. I had to give it 1 star, however because it's really not a universal diffuser. It seemed to fit my Remington Hair Dryer fine, but after using it the first time, it warped and melted. I saw a review before purchasing the diffuser that cautioned against it. However the person said their hair dryer was made of aluminum and since mine is made of plastic I thought it would be ok. I was using it on low power and high heat because there was nothing in the instructions that cautioned against using it on high heat. I'm very disappointed. I'd like to purchase another one of these, if I could find a dryer that was compatible with it. I e-mailed DevaCurl asking if they have a list of compatible dryers.

"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Why anyone would buy prestige brands off Amazon is beyond me, especially with the bootlegs people produce. You never know what you're truly getting! I bought this from Ulta, an actual devacurl seller, and have had no problems with it melting. On top of that, you're supposed to leave some ventilation at the barrel for the air to get out, not just through the hand, and it's meant to be used with low or medium heat. I had to buy a new dryer to fit this diffuser, not that I minded since my dryer was pretty old anyway.Revlon 1875W Quick Dry Lightweight Hair Dryer https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A3I2X4/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_AoUQAbVGFP5DCIt'll fit with a bit of force, you do have to push down hard and move the band up a bit. I don't intend on leaving my diffuser on it all the time. The band does contract once you pull it off, it doesn't stay stretched out to the dryer you just put it on.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I did not buy from amazon so this is not about the seller.  I bought from large chain beauty store instead.  The design is neat, and does cradle curls and can be inserted up ""into"" the curls while they hang naturally (instead of flipping over head with other diffusers).  But it is very difficult to get onto standard hair dryers.  I have a T3 and a generic Revlon and an Italian Turbo hairdryer and all of them have to have man-hand strength to force it onto the ends.  It also then slides off easily during storage.  And has to be put back on again by the husband who is sick of it.  I can't do it myself; the rubber band won't stretch enough for me to fit a standard size dryer.  It also takes the hair forever to dry.  When I saw the diffuser my stylist used, which wasn't this one, I realized it wasn't doing squat for my curls or my daughters and we have completely different curls.  For the price especially, thumbs down.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I'm a regular user of products in the Deva Curl line, so I was very excited to receive this as a birthday gift from my bf. I'd read all the rave reviews and seen videos of how it works for curly hair. I've used it twice and unfortunately, it did not perform as well as I thought it would.As a naturally-curly-haired girl, one of the things I've always been told is to not brush, comb, or run your fingers through your curls b/c all it does is break your curl pattern, make flyaways, and increase frizz. Because you slide the diffuser under your hair in order to dry the roots, it does exactly that: I had more flyaways and frizz than I had with my cheaper, old-school diffuser. It relaxed more of my curls instead of keeping the curl definition & pattern and even made some straight pieces. Because of all the holes in the design, esp around the outside of the fingers, blowing AIR - not just HEAT - comes out from all directions, which creates the flyaways & added frizz. I suppose it made my hair dry faster with all the extra air and heat, but honestly, I was too disappointed in how my hair was drying & looking to even notice. To dry curly hair, you want ONLY heat, not blowing air, in order to maintain your curl definition and bounce, so for me, this product was a surprising disappointment. Sadly, I will be returning it and buying another cheap, old-school diffuser that will give me the results that I want even if it takes a little more time.TIP: For those of you who said the diffuser did not fit your dryer, take measurements of your dryer BEFORE you purchase. The Deva Curl website has measurements & details listed. I took my measurements ahead of time, and while my dryer's circumference was at the max, it still fit. It did take some effort to get the diffuser onto the dryer and the band on the diffuser is tight and strong, but it will expand to fit your dryer if the measurements are correct.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Surprised and disappointed. It was fine reaching the roots (not great), but it does not scrunch my hair well. Since it is a smooth surface hair slides right off and does not aid in hair definition. I have 2C/3A hair that looses curl easy if not handled properly and this actually smoothed it out more than curl.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works great!!! I have a diffuser that came with my hairdryer that I liked enough... but this diffuser is WOW.BUTDO NOT USE IN HOT!!!Set your dryer to cool! If you have curly hair, you don't need to blow dry your hair with hot air if you want to wear your hair curly and as frizz-free as possible. Keeping your dryer on cool will help keep the frizz down, and keep your curls intact. Diffusers aren't meant to be used with hot heat! So if yours has melted... stop using hot heat, and start using cool air! It will make a HUGE difference!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Okay, so I am writing this to  help anyone who is debating getting this. I saw all of the reviews saying the diffuser wouldn't fit on their very basic dryer and here is why: the product does fit, it just takes some finagling. Honestly if it appears it doesn't fit at first this could be a good thing because it means it won't fall off! What you have to do is ""wiggle"" it on!!! Rock it for lack of better explanation. So if you buy this, don't return it unless you've tried this method. DC really needs to address this as people are frequently upset about this!! Hope this helps!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Wish I had read all the reviews about the diffuser not fitting most dryers. Didn't fit mine and when I took it to a store that had about 10 to choose from, it didn't fit ANY!  Not sure if those who had dryers that fit the diffuser were older models or what, but I think DevaCurl should address this issue by either modifying their design or telling people it won't fit most of the dryers on the market.  It would also be nice if read the numerous reviews (over 50%) where the diffuser didn't fit (or maybe they do and don't care).
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This past fall my duagher mentioned wanting a diffuser to properly take care of her very long wavy hair..i did a bit of research..all of the girls with curls seemed to vote for this one...after the fact I believe that i've made the right choice.  She was really happy with it and several of her friends said this 'was the best'
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
There's been a lot of hype when it comes to this defuser and that's not because it's poorly made. DevaCurl isn't known for doing shotty work then overpricing it. this is a good product for most curls, as long as it's being used correctly. This product melts because it can't stand heat just like your curls can't stand the heat. it's not made for high temperatures because you're not supposed to be exposing your hair to heat. my friend's had hers for years and it still works perfectly, so I decided to get one and I can't be happier with it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I bought this for my short (not quite jaw length) curly hair and it's *okay*... BUT it works WONDERS on my daughter's almost waist length, super heavy, super thick, wavy hair.  We can put the ""hand"" up into her hair and get it dry all the way through.  I have to really push to get it on my dryer and the join or connection separates on one side, but otherwise we like it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I REALLY wanted to like this. However, it did not fit any of my dryers. None. Had to return.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I have been embracing my hair's natural wave pattern (2b) more and more following the Curly Girl method but find that it's not always feasible to leave the house with wet hair, especially in the winter months. I have a standard bowl diffuser that came with my blow dryer (a Chi Pro) but for some reason it does not stay securely attached to the blow dryer's nozzle. This, coupled with the bowl diffuser's awkwardness when trying to dry certain areas of my hair, proved frustrating.  Enter the DevaFuser. What I love about this diffuser is that you can approach your entire head from various angles and the air blows from both sides of the diffuser in addition to airflow coming from each side of the ""fingers"". The fingers also enable you to target specific areas that a bowl diffuser might not be able to get to, like the back of your head, without breaking up the curl/wave clumps. There are plenty of wonderful videos on YouTube that demonstrate different ways to use the DevaFuser.The DevaFuser fits both my Chi Pro and my mom's antiquated Revlon dryer which have different sized nozzles. I did notice some separation at the attachment site when I put it on my Chi (hard to describe without a picture), but the thick rubber band seems to hold this diffuser in place fine. I have not had any issues with the plastic melting like other reviewers have stated, but I definitely recommend using the low setting on your dryer when using this attachment. I find that my hair is actually wavier/borderline curly when I take the time to diffuse it using the DevaFuser, probably because it gently dries wet hair, forming and establishing the curl pattern, unlike with air drying in which the weight of the water in the hair can weigh it down and elongate or pull out the curl pattern. I should also mention that I recently cut my hair to shoulder length. Very long hair will probably not completely ""fit"" into this diffuser the way that it might with a bowl diffuser, so that might be something to consider when purchasing this item.Overall, I am extremely happy with this item and it has definitely improved my daily hair routine and appearance!

Dries hair quickly.  Had a little difficulty finding a blow dryer it would fit.  Does keep the curl in - but plumps my hair up too much.  I need to keep toying with it, maybe just letting it blow over my hair, rather than going up from underneath.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love this diffuser! Dries from the roots perfectly, giving me lift without clips.  Took 10 minutes off my drying time and didn't frizz out my curls!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Sorry but this thing is horrible for my type of curl. Had a lot of messy flat looking curls. Only thing this is good for is giving lift to my roots. I will stick to the standard diffuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Terrible fit - it’s supposed to attach to the blow dryer with this elaborate rubber band thing that can’t possibly be durable!! It’s going back to the store!! Sigh
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I bought this to go with my hair dryer (with a barrel within dimensions shown by mfr), and it doesn't fit. In fact, it doesn't fit on 3 of my dryers. :(
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The devafuser did not fit on our hair dryer nor our daughters. It did not fit on any hair dryer sold at target. Had to go to a hair salon supply store to find a hair dryer that it would fit on. That said, my wife really likes the defuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I would like to try this, but has anyone used it on cool or warm setting and still have it melt?
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works well and delivered on time.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Considering the price, I feel it should adapt to any hair dryer. It seems to want to slip off because ofdesign.

DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I do not usually write reviews. I didn't see that many great reviews about this tool but took a risk at my local beauty store and bought it. Partially because they offered a Free gift with purchase.The cons:It was difficult to get onto my blow dryer. I have a Revlon something or other that I bought on amazon a few years ago, it works great. But getting the defuser on the blow dryer was a struggle. I may even purchase another blow dryer for doing blow outs with a round brush because I don't want to ever have to put the attachment back on my blow dryer.The Pros:I have very thick and curly hair. I hated leaving the house with hair that was still wet near the roots or in the back. I hated drying that part of my hair because the direct heat would burn my head, ouch!I use my blow dryer on high with a low heat setting, my hair is dry in about 10 minutes. Not only is it dry but my curls are soft and manageable. Game changer. I feel like my hair drys evenly and I don't have to worry about that awkward spot that is still wet.As someone who is blessed with curly hair, you can't afford to not have this gadget. I've googled, youtube'd, and the like every hair product, oh wet to dry straighter, really? broken in one use.This product actually works and does wonders.

My curly hair never looked so good!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love the design of this diffuser. It definitely allows you to get air flow into your curls without distorting the shape of the curls. The problem is that material the dryer is composed of cannot withstand even the low heat of a dryer. Mine melted into a gnarled claw shape that is completely useless. Anyone with thick curly hair knows that it takes quite a while to dry your curls. Even in the DevaCurl videos, they suggest holding the dryer in each position for 2 minutes. Well, do that and you will be lucky to not be cutting melted plastic out of your hair. Using the ""cool"" setting is simply impractical -- my hair would take hours to dry on ""cool,"" and it's not even beyond shoulder length! For this price, they should have chosen more durable material.  I've never seen anything like it in 30 years of using diffusers on my hair!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was so anxious to receive this ""hand"" as I call it.  Curly hair is difficult to style and make it look like it wasn't just air-dryed.  This attachment fits perfectly on my Infiniti Pro by Conair 1875 watt.  This hair dryer was much cheaper than the one shown with the attachment and had great reviews.  Anyway, this ""hand"" dries my hair at the root and doesn't dry out the ends which can look frizzy.  I highly recommend for those curly haired folks who like an uplifting curly style.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Fits like a glove on my jinri ionic infrared hair dryer! I wanted this after I got a deva cut and my stylist used it. Liked the results :)I give it only 3 stars because ....1. This is a cheaply made item (despite the great design) so I would NOT recommend this product to someone that likes to dry their hair on the high settings. I can definitely see this thing melting if it gets to hot. Maybe even breaking if you dropped it on a hard floor. I use this on low air and low to medium heat with no issues...however it does seem delicate to me.2. the drying time is slower than with a normal diffuser for my wavy curly hair. USEFUL TIP: The most airflow comes out of the finger tips. It took me a few goes to realize that but it's important to know. This helps in reducing your drying time and increasing volume.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This is 100% the best diffuser I've ever used. I'm not sure if I'm just not good at being a ""Curly Girl"" but I've had some serious issues with diffusers in the past. I always feel awkward using them and they can feel way too big and clunky. Don't get me wrong, this thing felt awkward too at first (come on, it's a hand) but now I love it and almost never go a day without it.Getting it on my hair dryer was a pain in the butt, so I caved and got my boyfriend to man-handle it on. You just have to put the nose of your hair dryer in and try to work the rubber band down so it holds everything together. I do NOT recommend using this diffuser on a high heat setting as it does get hot very quickly and some of the past reviews even said it can melt. I never had an issue getting my hair to dry quickly on the low setting and honestly I think high heat settings are never good for your hair (especially curly hair!). I recently also switched to the Deva Curl Supercream Coconut Curl Styler Cream, which I LOVE, and I put it on my hair before I diffuse it.Photo attached if you are interested in how my hair turned out using both products mentioned.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Honestly, I suspected this was a hokey and too-expensive product, but as many people with curly hair will attest, we'll try anything if it has half a chance of taming our curls.  I've been dealing with my curls for over 50 years and have had a love-hate relationship with diffusers.  Well, one use of the DevaCurl Devafuser and I was hooked. This diffuser delivered a quick blow-dry that minimized frizz and still maximized volume.  One of my biggest challenges was always drying my roots:  blow dry too much and the ends of my hair dried out and split; blow dry too little and damp roots would over the course of a couple of hours weigh down my hair and rob it of any volume on top while the rest of my hair stayed big, bold, and out there.  Half the time I'd be rockin' a Bozo The Clown look by lunchtime.  (And no, it wasn't the haircut.  I'd have had to go to a mullet to get my hair to keep any volume before.  And that was ... just not going to happen.)  Back to this diffuser ... well, it fixed all that:  now the volume stays and I don't need as much product.  I've been using it for over two years now; it's still in perfect working shape and my curls have stayed healthy.  And no more Bozo!  :)
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was so excited to use my new deva diffuser, I tried it the say it arrived. During my first try with my blow dryer the band broke while attached to my blow dryer. I guess the band needs to be stronger. I really like the design, so I added one of my hair bands to replace the broken band.  Maybe I should try to return for replacement. $40 is a lot to pay for somethimg to break one the fiest use.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I bought this diffuser for my naturally curly hair but was never comfortable using it and ended up switching back to a more traditional style round diffuser.  When I talked to my DevaCurl specialists, she told me this style of diffuser is intended for someone with thicker, curlier hair than mine.  My hair is 2c/3A curls but fine, so this diffuser was not the right one for me.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
VERY dissatisfied and dissappointed in this product! If I could return it, I would! I checked the measurements several times before purchasing and it should have fit according to the description. It doesn't fit either of my blow-dryers, or my friends, or my mother's! Didn't bother to even turn on the blow-dryer with it since I couldn't even get it on a blowdryer. I ever took off the band to try it that way! Tried selling on Facebook and no one would purchase even at half price. Do NOT buy!!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This did nothing to make my hair curly nor manageable.  I have wavy/curly fine hair... this made it look like I walked off the set of the Walking Dead.  Horrible device.  The company was kind enough to refund me.  The product DID arrive on time, packaged well and I didn't think it would fit on my blowdryer but if you initially sit down & put the blowdryer between your knee and PUSH this diffuser on - it does fit.  I have a few blowdryers and the fit was better with some than wider ones
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This did not fit on my T3 Featherweight hair dryer. Very disappointed.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I had a problem finding a hair dryer that would fit the DevaCurl, but I FOUND ONE!  right here on Amazon.  Chic Belle Professional Hair Dryer 1875W Ionic Black with Diffuser fits the DevaCurl perfectly!  And reasonable priced.  Have funChic Belle Professional Hair Dryer 1875W Ionic Black with Diffuser with it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I call this my chicken foot diffuser. It works great for my wavy hair. It has saved me from having to straighten my hair every day. I highly recommend it to anyone who just can’t air dry their hair without looking like a crack head. (My problem was real!) This allows me to dry my hair in waves with no frizz and I don’t have to put a bunch of hoop in my hair. I use the Deva towel and the wavy hair deva products. Life changing! Okay, maybe not life changing but I’m not spending 45 minutes on my hair anymore and that’s a big deal to me.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Regular cup diffusers mess up my wave pattern and make my hair look 'crinckled'.  The Devafuser dries my hair without disturbing the wave pattern.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The attachment does not fit on my hair dryer snugly even though it says it fits most hair dryers. (i have tried 2 different hair dryers) The air also escapes a lot at the spaces that are at the bottom of the attachment so not much air is outputted from the attachment itself. My hair is constantly being tangled at the opening since it expands and leaves large gaps for my hair to be hooked on. I regret buying the attachment. Thought i would save some money from purchasing just the attachment but now I don't even use it and have to use my cheaper diffuser which gives me good results with less trouble. Wished this worked good so that I can get the devacul results.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Dries well, gives great volume at the roots. Usually makes my waves look nice, but it can make make my hair frizzy in days when the humidity is low (but so can all diffusers). My daughter has straighter hair, and she even like it because it dries her roots so fast.I have a super solano and it fits really well over the narrow, straight barrel.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I'm sure this is a good product. But problem is it does not fit on my blow dryer. I've tried three and the end is to big. They blow dryer for this attachment is over $100 dollars. I'm not going to do that. So make sure to find a blow dryer that works.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love this product!  I have long thick wavy/curly hair.  This diffuser is so easy to use and dries my heavy hair quickly and evenly.  Be sure to use it on low heat.  There is no static - doesn't blow my hair all over the place and the curls stay.  I also use DevaCurl products as well.  I'm happy with all of them.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love how the base of this is fairly flexible but still snug enough to stay put on my dryer nozzle. So I can see this as being much more universal than other alleged ""universal"" diffusers out there. Fits my babyliss pro nano titanium hair dyer very well. It should be noted that this will probably only fit circular shaped nozzles.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
After debating whether or not I should buy this diffuser, I decided to purchase after finding a video on how to make this fit for larger hairdryers. My hairdryer's barrel is very fat (almost 2 inches in diameter) and it fit with minimal/gentle pressure. As far as performance, the DevaFuser did not dry my hair as quickly as standard diffusers, but I have significantly less frizz and my curls (3A/3B curls) are bouncier. It gave me great definition and great volume. The end result is well-worth the extra 15 minutes of drying time.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love this diffuser. Easier to use than I thought. It doesn’t fit blow dryers well with a wide nozzle, so I had to get a flow dryer with a thin nozzle. It does get hot so I switched to low heat, medium speed and seemed to work. Left my hair with a lot of volume and very little frizz.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I think the universal attachment is just too inconvenient for my hair dryer. It slides up constantly and it didn't feel like I was getting much air to my head. However I think the deva dryer with the diffuser that fits would be great.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I loved this, but after only 3 months of use, the arms started breaking off. It is way too expensive for that to happen. Therefore, though the product works great for us curly headed people, it is not sturdy. Unless you plan to buy a new one several times a year, I would stay away from this diffuser. By the way, it is huge.....
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Looks like a great product, but unfortunately, unlike it says in the description, it simply does not fit any hairdryer.I have 3 from brand new to a couple of years old.Probably it fits its own, but that isn't the point.You have the option to buy their hairdryer and that might work.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
For this price, I expected it to work better at creating waves.  What I did like about it was that it gets very hot, so shortens drying time.  It is a MAJOR pain to put on your dryer (and I tried it on multiple).  Glad I tried it, but I sent it back as not worth the price.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love thiS! It snaps on easily to my CHI blow dryer and works amazing! This, paired up with my deva curl hair products really make my hair amazing in ways I didn’t even know possible! Amazing diffuser! Game changer for anyone with curls
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Way overpriced! Cheap! Great idea but poor execution. It’s held together by a plastic band that wares and distorts from the heat of the blow dryer.It distributes the air ok but for $30-50 dollars will never purchase another. Come on Deva you can do better for the cost.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was very excited to use this diffuser when I got it. Got very disappointed when realized that it could not fit any of my dryers. Kept it for over a month to try it on many other dryers at different stores. Didn’t work! Now it’s too late to return it and I’m stuck with an expensive attachement that I can’t use. I wish I could give negative stars...
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love this!! It gives volume to my wavy hair as promised, and curls, if using the right products ;-)I don't leave reviews unless a great or terrible product. This is the former!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Didn't like it. Threw it out and went back to my old diffuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Broke with in a month. Extremely hard to get on my dryer and yes, I measured and it should have fit. The elastic band to hold it on broke today. Very disappointing.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love love love this curl defuser!!!  It makes my medium type, short curls look so good!  I hey compliments al of the time on my hair and I know it's thanks to this ""grinch hand""!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I loved the concept and design of this, and it really helped add volume and definition to my shoulder-length curls. However, the material it's made from should not be used in a diffuser! It does melt, and I can no longer use mine without it falling off due to the misshapen inside. I really wish they'd listen to all of the reviews that complain of this problem and change the material they make this with to something that can withstand heat...I have 20+-year-old diffusers that are in perfect condition, so I know it's possible!!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
The only thing I would caution it this diffuser doesn't fit just any hair dryer. It only fits driers with a smaller circumference. I ended up being able to use it on my travel dryer just fine. One can purchase the optional DevaCurl drier.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Fits Revlon Ceramic Tourmaline model RVDR5131. I use the diffuser on the warm setting without any problems. The end of my dryer barrel hardly gets warm so no issue with melting the diffuser attachment. My curls are full and soft! I won’t use another diffuser!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I liked that it covered a bigger area on my head as opposed to other diffusers. I really like it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
We were not able to use product because it would not fit on any hair dryers we had and we even purchased a new one with smaller end, but it still would not work.  We were able to return easily for a full refund, which is why we are giving it 3 stars.  We would try again if we could get it to fit on a standard hair dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I honestly don’t have anything to say. This was for my daughter who knew exactly what she wanted. Must be good as I never a word. Lol
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Opening on product does not match what ad states. Useless.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Designed to fit different hair dryers this attachment drys the bottom layer of the hair without causing it to poof out. An excellnt design because the bottom layer of hair is always the hardest to dry.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works well, hold hair in place when drying, even gives a bit of a lift.  To me this company is the best!!!  Shampoos, conditioners, gels, etc...Hair towel is awesome..
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Within minutes, my rubber band snapped off and immediately was broken. I tried to put a regular rubber band on to hold it in place but that didn't work either. I was under the impression this would fit any blow dryer, but that was not the case.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love the way this product works but I have to say I am very concerned that it won't last. It has already split up the side and I have only had it a week. It does an amazing job at keeping my curls not frizzy and it drys my hair really fast but the durability is in question.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
So easy to use and adds lots of volume to my long curly hair
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Was hesitant to spend so much, but this diffuser really works. Worth it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I really like this.  It fits my blow drier and seems like it would fit most, even an oval end.  The connection is a large stretchy rubber piece so that the end should work with a variety of blow driers.  I like that I can get the fingers against my head to dry there, but there are holes on the outside as well.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It is an excellent tool for drying, I do not use it whenever I have wither me, rather let hair dry in the open air and then I add volume with this. I usually use it when I'm in a hurry. I like it
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Ended up returning it. Felt like the plastic was going to break everytime I put it on the hairdryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It doesn't fit on my hair dryer.  Might be a great product but if it doesn't fit your dryer it won't work.  All the air leaks out before it gets to the ""fingers"".  Also, it's awkward I poked myself in the face with it more than once before I just gave up and tossed it in the drawer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It will not fit my dryer. I have bought and returned 2 additional hair dryers and can not find one it will fit. I wish I would have kept the box so I could return it. It may work well but I'll never be able to find out.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Broke as soon as I put it on my hair dryer. Never got to use it.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
ANAZING!! It took me 40 years to finally find this hand shaped diffuser!! Perfect for those of us with curly locks (along with my new Curly Locks hair cream.) works just like my hand used to but dries so much faster, even on low heat!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It’s just ok. Would return if I could
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I actually love the concept but this is the third one I have purchased (since April) and all three melted on to my dryer after a few weeks of using.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Meh. No better than a regular diffuser for my long curly hair. Waste of money in my opinion. It's sitting in my cupboard.Just turn your head upside down and dry with a regular diffuser.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I'm really excited to finally have one of these!  I think it works so much better than a regular diffuser attachment.  I had no trouble putting it on my hair dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Makes your hair curly. Works as described.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I was really excited to get this because I am a fan of all Deva products but this is not really a big thing. It's just a plastic hand, not too comfortable/easy to use. If I push it too deep into my dryer's mouth, I feel it's going to break.  I didn't return it but I'm also not using it. I prefer a regular round diffuser. Maybe it's a good idea to take it on a trip since it's light and it supposedly fits most hair dryers.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Perfect gift
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love what this diffuser does for my curly hair. The problem is it didn't fit on 4 of the 5 dryers I own... This is a pain and, for the cost, I should be able to use it on any dryer.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I love this hair care line but this will not stay on ether of my hair dryers. Totally makes me sad. I am giving it a 2 star because I know it would work great of it would stay on.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works great on adding volume and defining my curls.  Helps cut down on frizz
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Definitely shortens drying time and helps increase volume but I've found it to be very flimsy. One of the arms has already broken off. I'll probably just go back to a regular diffuser once this one breaks (which seems like it will be pretty soon).
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Had to purchase new dryer it didn't fit what I had.The hand is a great design but how you attach it to the dryer makes it difficult to use.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Waste of money doesn’t work
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Not great. Also my hair dryer sucked my hair into the motor while using.... watch out.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
It works okay. It doesn't work as will as I thought it would. The concept is great but I think my regular diffuser works better and was cheaper. I wouldn't buy it again
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This diffuser does a great job at drying my roots and creating volume.  It seems to help reduce frizz in my 3b, fine, BSL hair.  It fits my dryer well.  The rubber band around the base stretches easily but remains tight to hold it on.  Also it seems pretty sturdy as I have dropped it several times with no cracks or breaks.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
does not fit on normal hair dryer would have been great to know, but with some creative engineering and a clever application of of rubber bands I got it finagled to work and I do like this diffuser it works wonders on my mass of red curls.

Ask fit. But once you get it on dryer it performs well.

DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This devafuser is awesome it makes it so my hair doesn't fall flat at the roots! If you have curly hair it's a must. I do recommend going to their website so you can see how to use it. It does take longer to use, but its totally worth it!
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I'm impressed with this odd looking tool. I have wavy hair that loves this diffuser. I have little friz and my waves are more curls (if I lay on the floor and dry them)
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I ended up returning this product. One of the biggest selling points for me was the promise of more volume and curl. I get more volume and wave from a blowout. I just wasn't impressed. Also, the product seems weak. The seams started splitting.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Mine is melting! I don't even use it on high heat either! I've not even used it 10 times.  I only use it when I don't have time to air dry.

I don't really like to dry my hair with this fuser. But, I have used it only once

It didn't fit my dryer and it melted😧
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
This diffuser Is not universal like the description saids. I am very disappointed.I have tried it on 2 dryers, like another reviewer said what is the point of the adjustable band if you can't adjust it onto the dryer? I don't feel like trying to send it back so I have put a rubber band around it to make sure my dryer does not slip off of it. Hopefully that will work.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Love this air diffuser to dry my curly hair. It is easy to install in the nose of the hair dryer and easy to use.

I tried to fit this on three different hair dryers, with no success.  On the third attempt, I bent it beyond the point of functionality.  Now I can't return it, nor can I use it.

Didn't do anything for my hair. Regular diffuser is better.

This is great for curly girls.  Works better than the traditional diffusers.  It's a bit bulky, so I'm trying to find a hose that I can hook to this and attach it to my hair dryer.

Works really well with curls. I have short hair, but it would work for long curly hair too.  doesn't frizz your hair, it enhances your curls.

Works as described.  Can dry my curly locks quicker and ""naturally"" and get better volume than with using clips and a hood dryer.  Love it.

DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I have a diffuser that came with my hair dryer already. I wondered what was so great about this Deva diffuser that would make it any better than a regular diffuser. Wow- this is definitely a great purchase! I love, love, love how the air from the hair dryer escapes through the diffuser, surrounding the diffuser. The air dries the hair below and above the diffuser. It is very similar to sitting under the dryer at the salon. My hair is not frizzy after use, like with my other diffuser. This Deva diffuser is NOT to be used with hot air!! I use it with the cool or low temp setting. My waves look healthy and I love that I am not burning my hair with high heat. It fit perfectly on my hair dryer and I really appreciate that it STAYS on the dryer. Fantastic product to use if you are going for the natural curl. I highly recommend!

Fit's perfectly on my blow dryer and definitely gives me a better volume than a regular diffuser. Which was exactly what I was looking for.

Love this diffuser. It's a FAST and frizz-free curl drying attachment!The Green Hand Diffuser is borderline a bit creepy looking, but no matter. It does what it's supposed to do, dries curls–  roots and all – FAST and frizz-free, which is the whole point of this product.It attached perfectly to my 2"" diameter blow dryer. I use it on the lower heat as per recommendation. There are lots of YouTube how-to use videos for various hair types.Love having this extra hand around to help with the hair drying.

Be warned this is not a universal fit.  It specifically did not fit, nor come close to fitting my dryer which is a Centrix QZone.  So I had to send it back.

Very little air coming through this piece.  It would take a very long time to dry my hair with this DevaFuser.  It just is not powerful enough fir air to get through, maybe a poor design.

Love, love, love, this diffuser! I recommend to anyone with curly hair and needs to dry your hair. I wish I had gotten it sooner!
"

This is a decent product, but I don't find it to yield much better results than a traditional diffuser which you can find MUCH cheaper. The attachment end of this is extremely small, too, I had to buy a new dryer just to get it to fit.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
Works great once you struggle putting it on the blow dryer That's not deva.
"
DevaCurl DevaFuser; Universal Hair Diffuser,"
I'm so disappointed with this diffuser.  It looks revolutionary in its design and does not deliver in the way it's advertised.  First off, it's huge!  I was really surprised at the size and awkwardness of working with it.  I was excited about having a diffuser that could help me dry close to my scalp but soon discovered that the size was hard to manage and that I could only tolerate the lowest settings that close to my head which made the process take twice as long.  I found that by drying from underneath, the top curls were getting frizzy which defeats the purpose.  In addition, I had to wrestle to get it on the end of a standard sized blow dryer (Conair).  I'm going back to my Segabeauty diffuser.  For this price point, I expected much more than I got.

So much frizz!  I tried to place the ""hand"" under my curls to get a little volume and it wrecked my hair.  Back to the bowl diffuser.
"

Not worth the $$$. I didn't find it helped my curly hair. My ordinary diffuser was better. Great concept but no.
"

I love the diffuser -- but you must have a hair dryer with a small enough nozzle to fit the diffuser. I ended up purchasing two before I found one that fit.

I bought this towel to dry my curly hair using the plopping method. I'm between a 3b and 3c, hair is shoulder length when dry. I found that the microfiber material dried my hair more quickly than a regular time shirt and with minimal frizz. Two downsides to the product, however. First, it's not possible to ties the ends together to do a proper plop, this is partly due to length and partly due to the thickness of the material compared to a thinner t-shirt. Second, when I tried to use the towel as a regular twisted turban, one side of the loop ripped apart from the body of the towel. Since this is the main function of the towel, minus 3 stars.

Don't waste your money! I'm a big fan of Devacurl, but this towel is garbage. The very first time I tried to hang it up, the loop came off and immediately unraveled such that it can't be repaired.

I got one for me and one for my daughter.  She lives in a dry area and I live in a humid area.  She is very pleased with her results using the towel and her hair is curlier than mine.  I have more of a body wave and my hair is also gray.  Here in the humid climate, using this towel works well for the first day or two.

This is a great towel. I have several microfiber towels that I have purchased from the beauty supply and from Marshalls. However, this is THE only towel that I've ever used that does not frizz out my 3c-4a hair. It is soft, easy to clean, and comes in a good size. I usually wrap my hair up turban style and let the towel soak up the water for a few hours before air drying or sitting under the dryer.

Loop on the back of the towel ripped off after 2 weeks of use. Loop was important as it secured the towel on  my head once I turbaned. Also you could use the loop to hang the towel  to dry after use.

This towel is so tiny for the price. I have extremely long and thick hair. I can't wrap even half of my hair with this. I gave it to my boyfriend with shoulder length hair.

Based on other reviews, there must be 2 versions of the gray towel being sold. The one that I received will NOT fit on an adult's head. I have a small head, and it is not big enough to wrap around my head and stay there (turban style). The material is nice, but I get frustrated every time I use it. Wished I had paid more attention to the other reviews. I kept it because I like the fabric.

I had a smaller Deva Curl towel and liked it, except that it was too small.  I like to wrap my head with the towel while I finish drying and dressing.  This towel is much better than the one I had before.  It is thicker and larger, and it doesn't pill like the white, with green trim, towel that I had before.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Did notice that this absorbs more water than a regular towel. Also keeps the hair from frizzing. Not too big or heavy. Easy to wrap hair and go on about your business. Doesn't tangle the hair if used correctly.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
The Devafuser feels so comfortable on my head and I think it disperses heat more evenly than my regular diffuser. It for my dryer perfectly and I'm in love with the DevaTowel. I've never used a microfiber towel on my hair before, so I was pleasantly surprised when it really did cut down on my frizz.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This thing sucks up water like you wouldn't believe.  I have super thick, heavy hair and using this towel cuts my dry time (air dry) in half.  I just wish that it was shaped differently so I could ""plop"" my hair, or wrap it up.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I am so happy with this purchase.  Soon as I used it I said, this is what I've always needed.  It is wonderful for drying and wrapping my hair.  I love it so much.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This towel seems to make my hair quite a bit softer.  I use my own products.  I have natural curl and some of the not-so-curly parts seem to do better with this towel.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I've never gone back to a regular towel for my hair ever again. This is also really good for drying your face.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This towel is for anyone who lets their hair air dry. No more dripping everywhere. Curls are clumped. Drying time is definitely cut in half for me. Glad I finally purchased this item. No more water trail or wet collars.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Works for medium to short hair length! I had my hair longer, up to my middle back and had some of my hair still sticking out of the towel. Now that my hair is shoulder length it fits for my hair. - 4a/4b thick wavy hair
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
When I got it in the mail the box that it came in with was kind of broken so I was a bit disappointed with that. I realized that this towel isn't that useful to me because I like how my hair comes out when I air dry my hair better. I suppose this towel is good for when you have to go in a hurry and don't want to leave your hair dripping wet.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This towel is wonderful! Great size for my thick, shoulder length hair, dries my hair so much quicker that regular towels. There is a loop on one side that I use to tuck the tail in to keep it in place. Perfect!
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Unfortunately the strap that holds the towel in place broke after a couple weeks of use. Was so disappointed because I needed that to hold the towel in place well I get my baby dressed and things done. Now it’s just annoying because I constantly have to fix the towel and re wrap it, other then that it works great at absorbing extra water, not leaving my hair frizzy, and is very soft.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Towel works great in conjunction with the Deva curl products...leaves moisture in your hair, but helps soak up excess water (I hope that makes sense).

My daughter loves the Deva products.  She really enjoys using  the Deva diffuser.  She said it is the best diffuser that she has had.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
It caused my hair to frizz.  I always use an old tee shirt to scrunch my curls and will stick with that.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Purchased for my daughter who has long, thick, wavy hair. Her hair is very thick and takes forever to dry. She says this helps her hair dry faster, and she likes the no-friz feature as well. Thanks!

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Love this towel.  It's the perfect size to plop my long curly hair.  Dries super quick and pretty much frizz free.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I was disappointed to find the box torn and dirty.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Towel needs to be bigger or come in more sizes for those with long hair.  Wasn’t big enough to even begin to dry my hair
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I find that it makes my hair less frizzy than a traditional towel but I would prefer it in a larger size. Drying anything other than my hair it feels odd, I've dried my hands on it a few times and it takes less time than a traditional towel while drying my hands but not making them feel overly dried.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I read a lot of comments that it wasn't big enough but I found it PLENTY big (my hair is considered long and slightly thin). Its about 21x40"". It's so absorbent I don't need it to stay on my head long AT ALL. But if you need to do the Turbine style you can put the loop at the back of your head, twist up and tuck into the loop.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
The material is done, but the size is probably a little small for anything but the smallest head or length of hair. Most annoying? The cloth hook (to loop the towel tip into to hold it in your head) ripped out on all 4 that I bought within a week of normal use. The stitching on this piece of the towel is shoddy for such overpriced towels. I do not recommend.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Amazing towel, and just the right size. I have very thick curly hair and this decreases the drying time by half. Plus it's super soft, and easy to pack for travel.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Very disappointed. It was broken when I opened the package.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This towel dries my hair very quickly. It is very soft and super absorbent. If you have long or thick hair, you need one of these. Plenty big enough to wrap around my head and twist up. I have just below shoulder length hair that is on the thicker side.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Gets the extra moisture out quick and it's nice and big
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Just as described. Bought as a gift so i haven't personally used it but it seemed good quality.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Not to be dramatic or anything, but this towel has changed my life. I used to have such a problem with frizz that I couldn't let my hair air dry without risking resembling Medusa, so I always just put it up in a bun. But now, I can walk out in the freaking rain with no issues. Seriously would recommend.

Wonderful way to draw out moisture after shampoo without ""roughing up"" my [wildly curly] hair.  I purchased with the DevaCurl ""No Poo"" shampoo and conditioner.

Love this hair drying towel.. Purchased this one for my daughter and she loves it.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I was unsure how a towel could change my hair after a wash, but it really did help my hair not frizz like a normal towel always has. Good investment if you have hair with a mind of its own.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Really like it so far.  Haven't been able to use it for plopping yet, which is one of the things I wanted it for, but it does work good for removing water from my hair.

I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law who has very long, thick hair and she loves it!
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
It is smaller than a normal size towel which means when i try to put my hair up with the towel it doesn't stay. Even though i currently have short hair so i can't imagine how it will be when i have long hair again :/
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
For starters I ended up having to pay an additional $5.45 to the postmaster at delivery due to it not having enough postage. This diffuser does not fit all blow dryers. I feel they are forcing you to purchase their blow dryer with this diffuser. The towel yes is soft but doesn’t absorb any water to help with drying. Very disappointed in this purchase.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
The best!! Much larger than original and more absorbent. My hair dries in less than 1/2 the time. Worth the money ladies!! Our hair is important!
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I had the small one, and it does not even closely compare.  I am able to dry all of my hair, and my hair is thick, and it really helps with the frizz.

I can say if you don’t have this towel you have to buy one right now!! Best towel help your hair to frizz

Towel absorbs water just right but wish it was larger. My hair is long and it doesn't cover all of it

Saw absolutely no difference in my hair whatsoever

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This towel works great- leave it on a bit and get water out of your hair then dry with devacurl blow dryer and products- no frizz. Also, this is a new bigger size and is perfect- not the smaller ones people were leaving criticism about in other reviews.

This towel is amazing. It helped tame the frizz in my curls so much. I do wish it was a little bigger so I could wrap my hair up in it. It's incredibly soft, and dries quickly when hung. I was skeptical that a towel could increase curl and cut frizz, but it really does work.

A must hair for frizzy curly hair. I wish it was bigger.

It’s ok. I bought a cheaper version at Kmart and stays on head much better. It’s like the size of a hand towel and dolls off easily. Save yourself some money and get T shirt fabric at the store.

didn't think a fabric would make a difference - but this curly girl discovered this towel is every curly head's dream

I just started on my curly girl hair routine, and was told a microfiber towel was a must. I am so happy with the deva curl towel it isn't even funny. I noticed an automatic change in my hair. Less frizzy, and I love that my hair is still damp to apply products too but I am not dripping water every where.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Love this!  My curly hair feels and looks great since I have used this. It is drying and that helps not to have sopping wet hair for wash and go.Nice size .

It is a good towel to aid in keeping my hands clean, while adding styling products to my hair. I cannot use it effectively to dry my hair because after using the towel twice the loop hair come away from the towel on one side. I never used it tightly.

I have long curly hair and the towel is not big enough if you have hair to your shoulders.  They need to offer bigger sizes for people with longer hair to be effective. Cannot use it with the current size.

This towel is the holy grail of hair care! This towel absorbs so much water from my hair that it is nearly dry after air drying for about 15 minutes, whereas normally it takes about 2 hours for my hair to air dry. I can flat iron my hair without having to blow dry, which obviously saves heat damage. I also use this towel to  minimize frizz when I wear my hair wavy. I apply product to my hair when it is soaking wet and scrunch my hair using this towel. I have much less frizz this way as compared to when I use my fingers to scrunch! I LOOOOVE it!

I've only embraced my curls since last summer but I'm loving them. This towel really helps speed up drying without damaging my curls or causing it to frizz.

This is like a MIRACLE product for frizz and it's ""just a towel"". I use it right after I get out of the shower to dry my hair a bit then after applying my hair products, I also SCRUNCH with this towel and let air dry. My hair is SOOOOO much less frizzy than usual!!!! I can't even believe it!!! I was scrunching with my hands before and I KNEW it would mean more frizz but I never thought of using a towel. But not any old towel, THIS ONE! I would highly recommend it! Worth the $$!!

I used to use my husband's t-shirts to wrap my hair after wasihng, but these are so much better . . .  I wrap up immediately after stepping out of the shower, and by the time I have dressed and eaten breakfast, my hair (18 inches or so, straight, but more like 12 when curled up dry) is simply damp -- perfect for adding product and heading out the door.  The size is perfect for me, and one goes in my gym bag when I work out there.

Did a turban wrap with this after using the deval curl shampoo, conditioner and styler.  Had great definition.  No frizz at all.  For short hair I recommend doing a turban as opposed to scrunching.  Scrunching actually gave me some frizz since I have 4a/4b texture hair.  Bop plopping was the key.  Had enough moisture left to still do twists but not running all over the place like with a cotton shirt.

I don't know what voodoo lies in this towel but it is pure magic. I've been following the curly girl method for a couple of weeks to get back my curls that disappeared after YEARS of straightening. The ends of my hair are especially fried and need as much help as possible. I've been using the Devacurl volumizing foam to set my curls and then scrunching with a t-shirt. The t-shirt definitely cut down on frizz but couldn't absorb much of the water, so my hair would be sopping wet still. I finally invested in this towel and it is MAGICAL! My hair was curling after the first scrunch because the towel was so absorbent, yet 0 frizz! I am now able to let my hair air dry in the towel while I get ready for work instead of going to work with wet hair. I really really happy I bought this!

I have a closet full of curly hair products and I've tried different diffuser's, but I still could not get the perfect curl.  I never would have thought that a towel would make such a difference.  My curls looks great!!!  The frizz is gone and my curls are more defined. This towel is fantastic!
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I read complaints about the older towel being too small - well, this one is just right.  Also, it soaks up so much water from my hair that I only squeeze the water out and don't use this towel to wrap up my hair - I think if I wrapped it up my hair would be too dry to put product in!  I just wrap my hair in a t-shirt after putting the product in (google ""glopping"").  Overall, I'm pleased with this - but I probably could have used the smaller towel.  :)

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This is my first microfiber towel for my hair and I love it. It doesn't remove the frizz 100% but it's a lot better than the plain cotton t-shirt I was using instead. This towel is large enough to wrap your hair in it if that's something that interests you (my hair will turn into a sphere if I do that), and it comes with a loop to hang it up for drying. DO NOT WASH IT IN A WASHING MACHINE. Hand wash it in your tub, wring it out and leave it to air dry (it's a towel, that's how they dry anyway). I use DevaCurl No-Poo, One Condition, and then apply a pump of their Light Defining Gel into my hair while it's still soaking wet (pressing it into my curls from the tip to the roots by bringing my hair up to my scalp). After that, I use the Devatowel to bring my curls up to my head and GENTLY press. This towel does a great job absorbing the right amount of water, it won't be dripping nor will it be frizzed out and bone dry. Don't rub your curls, they'll separate and frizz. Don't squeeze on them like you're choking the water out of them, you want some moisture to be in there. With your head tilted or flipped, just bring the curls to your head using the towel and gently press. This was worth the money.

It's works great!

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
After using this for a couple months, I have definitely noticed less frizz, and more defined curls because I'm scrunching instead of twisting. This is a nice size, I can wrap it around my whole head. It is very absorbent to the point that if I wrap my head straight out of the shower without letting my hair drip for a minute, it doesn't feel like it weighs 5 pounds. Very satisfied with this product and I use it every time I shower, it doesn't smell after using it for a couple weeks either, but I do wash it about once a month.

This towel works well - it dries efficiently and is very large - large enough to wrap around all of my hair. It is losing 2 stars for quality. There is a loop mid-way to be used to hang up the towel to dry. This loop broke on one side before I even first washed it or got a chance to use it. I hope it holds up after many more washes. Poorly made, but gets the job done better than the competition.

I was looking for a towel for my long hair and this looked promising. It wasn't what I expected but it ended up being perfect. I sewed together one side so I could wrap it around my head like a turbie twist towel and it's perfect. More than long enough for my hair this way
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I was worried this wouldn't be big enough to contain my long hair (down my back to my bra line)  but it does cover it.  The first day I didn't see a difference as far as reducing frizz, but after using it several times I am now noticing a difference.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
It worked fine as a towel, however, I saw no improvements in my hair, or anything to justify buying this specific version, over a much cheaper microfiber alternative.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
It's bigger than the white one but still not big enough to wrap my hair .But it does what it's supposed to  in the terms of helping with drying your curls.

The towel is much better than the original deva towel which is much better for shorter finer curly hair. It absorbs more.

I got this knowing that most likely it would be a major rip-off and I could return it.  I would then write a review telling people what a waste of money it is.It didn't work out that way.  I love it.It is thicker and more luxurious than normal microfiber (all microfiber is *not* created equal--look at the fiber content and thickness--100% polyester microfiber is just about useless).  I had seriously thought of sewing some cheaper microfiber towels together, but this thing is wonderful.  I use it every morning, hang it up on a towel rack, and then it's fine by the next morning.  I'm one who puts product on first (that's what my Devacurl stylist told me to do) and then I scrunch it with the towel.  The towel gets very wet, but dries nicely.  It doesn't get yukky, but I wash it once a week anyway.  I don't know if I wash it correctly, but I just dump it in with all my towels, wash it on hot, and dry it in the dryer.  I never use fabric softener, so my towels are very absorbent.I do wish it could be about two inches longer on either end, but that's definitely not a deal-breaker, nor is it enough to mark it to four stars.I'm ordering one for my daughter for Christmas, and I might even get myself another one ""just in case.""  Not sure what the ""just in case"" might be, but I don't want to be without it!!

I ordered two of these hoping they would come to good use. I had previously ordered one but it got lost in the mail. When they arrived, they were nothing like the picture. The towels I had received were white and not gray and very small. I have pretty long hair and I am sure that this towel will not even hold half of it. I am VERY disappointed in this product because I read so many positive reviews yet this product does not even compare to what they are saying. These towels were not cheap and I will definitely be returning them.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This is a great towel for curly hair. I wrap my hair up and leave it on while I finish getting ready. Once I'm done I let my hair down. This towel soaks up more water than a normal towel. No more hair dripping constantly as with normal towels.

I love this towel. It's the first microfiber towel I've ever owned, so I have nothing to compare it to. That being said, I'm very happy with it. I usually braid my hair into 4 large braids after washing it, and it usually takes at least 24 hours for my hair to fully air dry. With this towel, I squeeze out the excess water from my hair after conditioning and braiding, and after 4 hours my hair is already 50% dry with no frizz. I don't know how it works, but it absorbs just the right amount of water while still leaving the hair hydrated. Best $$ I've spent on a hair tool in a while.

I don't know whose heads the DevaCurl people were measuring when they manufactured these towels.  Toddlers?  Cats?  Would it really have been that much pricier to make a slightly larger towel that would actually rather wrap around the head, instead of constantly unravelling/falling off?  Microfiber is very useful,and does minimize frizz. It's also not that expensive.  DevaCurl missed an opportunity here, because I doubt people who bought this once would buy it again.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This grey towel is so much better than the older  version of the Devacurl towel, which was white and was much too small to wrap comfortably around the hair. The new towel is soft and plush, dries amazingly fast, and really does help the curls retain their shape without frizz. I've found that the key is to allow the wet hair to remain wrapped in the towel for as long as possible, up to 30 minutes, for beautifully curled hair with no frizz.Devacurl is now my favorite hair towel. It's much better than the Aqua Lisse towels, and a huge improvement over the cheaper microfiber towels that claim to be Devacurl dupes.

I bought this from you 2/27/15. I'm not a pro, just a woman with thick long hair that used to take a good hour to blow it out  This cuts time by 2/3 to 1/2 easy. Loved it. Then one day plugged it in and nothing. I had a friend look at it and believes the gfi plug is no good. Is this a common complaint?  I know m just over the two year warranty- because I waited too long to let ok into replacing it, but I've probably used the dryer less than 30 times.  Total at 1/2 hour each it's approx 15 hours of total use. Even if you multiplied it by 2. Or 4. I've never owned a "" nice"" hair dryer and my drug store ones are still working from 10 years ago  Can you help get me warranty replacement please?  Please help... Pam. 818-464-5640.

When I saw this product in Ulta after getting my new perm the day before I was like wth & figured it was really no better than a towel, BUT for some reason I suspended my judgement & got one thinking I could always return it.. .holy cow, my hair dried in half the time & I didn't need a wet brush to gt through it, I was able to just run my fingers through it leaving me with way more natural & softer curls.. .I'm a believer and ordering another on for backup if one is already wet as i travel frequently.. .it is lush & feels wonderful.  Thank you DevaCurl folks!!!

My hair needs to be very wet when I apply product or it won't clump well. Then I use a towel to scrunch the curls and gently squeeze out excess water.  This towel can handle all that water and much more.  All my other microfiber towels end up completely soaked.Minus a star because I wish it was larger.

Loved it, but way too big! Too difficult for me to manipulate. Possibly because I only have the use of 1 hand. I'd prefer it either smaller or in a large turban-wrap style so we can wrap up our hair up with ease in this great material.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Has made a huge difference in my hair! Love how big it is for my long curly locks. I found that the little tab sewn in the towel to hang has been secured well and is still intact with my towel. I wash this in cold water and hang to dry. Also after using I hang this on a towel bar to make sure all the moisture has evaporated before hanging the towel with the little tab attached. This way the moisture doesn't create a mildewy smell. I think this also limits the weight put on the tab resulting in a longer use. I think this towel is genuinely DevaCurl quality and not a knockoff like some DevaCurl products are on Amazon.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Yes, the towel is long but it is not wide so its difficult to twist my hair completely inside. My old microfiber turban towel had a hook and button so it was easy to secure tightly on my head. This towel just falls off and was twice as expensive.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This is the second time I purchase this towel so I can have 2. I pull a new one out as I launder the used one. This towel quickly removed excess water from my curly hair. I used to have the problem that my hair was not dry enough when I put hair products so it would still dry with frizz. With the deva towel, I have more control of how much water is removed  my curls are much more healthier. I travel with the deva towel  for all my work trips and vacation. Sometimes I wish it were slightly bigger but it still gets the job done. The little lop at the end isn't as durable. It has already ripped on both of mine. It would have better of the loop were elastic to fasten the end of the towel down. Overall, I still give this towel 5 stars.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
The DevaCurl Towel works extremely well. Both my sister and I have frizzy and tight curls and we have been caring for our hair incorrectly for years. The towel dries our hair while preventing it from being frizzy and poofy. I would recommend this towel to anyone who has dry and coarse hair. The only down side to this product is it is $16 and any microfiber towel or cotton tee-shirt will work just as well.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
It's ok. It is just like a car wash microfiber towel so don't know what it is I'm paying for as it doesn't really absorb water well. So good for maintaining the curls and not having friction but not really great for it's purpose of drying or absorbing water.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I've been using a t-shirt and kept hearing about this towel on curly gurl videos. I got it on sale, which was nice, because $20 for a towel seems a bit much. Instead of minimizing frizz, it made my hair frizzier than it's ever been. The day I resumed using a t-shirt, the frizz halo was gone. It seems that with my hair, this product did the opposite of what it's intended to do. Hopefully, I can return it.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
It's okay. I do like that it's pretty large, enough for my curly hair (shoulder length). If my hair were longer, I don't think it would be as easy to use this towel. For the price, iffy on if it's worth it.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I use it on my hair and my son's! We both have curly hair and it really makes a difference. It dries it super fast without damaging my hair. It is not a big towel, so if you have a lot of hair, use a bigger version.

This towel has definitely helped dry my hair faster and I have no issue fitting all my hair into it. However, I really haven't noticed any change in the amount of frizz.

I absolutely love this towel. I have the mini one that was in a bundle pack I bought years ago. The bigger one though is amazing. It's about half my height which is awesome because I have a lot of hair. It feels like a spa towel. When I rung the excess water out of my hair, it didn't leave my curls frizzy.

I can only use 1 hand.  So this is great on my short hair. Best used with small nozzle hair dryer, no more than 5.25 inches in circumference.  👍😊

Love this towel. It does amazing things for my curls in combination with the DevaCurl products. Wish it was a tad bigger though.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
It's pointless, it doesn't stay in your hair because it's not big enough.

Works nice for my hair, 4c

I love the larger size of these newer Deva towels.  I do wish there was a different color option than gray though.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Yup, works for my curly hair. Loove that it has a hook. It is soft and does not feel weird like some other microfiber towels. Also does not make my hair static.

LOVE this towel. Just sad I waited so long to purchase one!!

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
The towel is much improved from the older version of the diva towel since it's bigger and thicker.  It has a handy loop to hang it up.  I like using it vs a regular towel because it's the perfect size and absorbency.

Very good

Good quality

The hanging hook broke off of this within 3 uses. It is not a huge deal, but also annoying that it couldn't last a few days in one piece. Overall, the towel works for what you are looking for.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Eliminates frizz entirely! LOVE IT! Only con is I have quite long hair and it does not all fit in the towel and I resolve this issue by scrunching my hair with the towel so it's not too drip-y. Would buy again.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Really this towel is worth it. It is big enough to plop with (a technique for  wrapping curly hair to dry) and soaks up water great with no frizz.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Love, love, love this towel.  No more frizzy hair and really dried my hair quickly!
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This towel is amazing!!! I love it, it gets your hair just dry enough without frizzing. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I wish it was slightly bigger so that I could tuck it into the back after I wrap my hair up.

This towel does nothing different then a cotton t-shirt would. My hair still looks frizzy even with following the proper protocol and using their styling crème.

works great, love it
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Such an improvement from the original! First, it's much larger which is nice. Second, the original is white and I've had mine for about a year now and it hasn't aged well, but I believe this gray color won't look gross in a year. Third, it's so much softer and it dries my hair SO WELL. I have very curly hair and this towel dries it perfectly to where I can put product in it, use the towel to scrunch it up, and I have perfect volume and basically no frizz. A must have for people with naturally curly hair. Basically a life changing styling tool.

I love this towel, my curls were way less frizzy than normal and they stayed in tact. One star was knocked off because while it's long, it's not too wide.

Super absorbent. No frizzy hair
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I think this diffuser does a better job of drying curly hair close to the scalp to provide volume while allowing the longer areas to dry more slowly and therefore with less frizz.  The towel is a nice extra.  I haven't noticed the towel making a big difference when compared to a regular towel on my hair, but my hair is possibly less frizzy with use.  The diffuser only works on driers with a narrow, long nozzle.  I have 3 hair driers, and it would only fit on one--just barely.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This towel is VERY nice and plush.  Definitely feels like you're pampering yourself with this spa like towel.  It also does a pretty good job of absorbing water from the hair.  My only complaint is that the loop came off after just two uses.  Nothing to be alarmed about since it's still long enough to tuck at the nape of my neck but I was hoping to hang the towel on a hook to dry.  Oh well, I guess I'll just hang on a rack it like my other towels.

The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because the towel is very absorbent but I'm very disappointed only used the towel twice and the 2nd time the loop came off, I guess I made mistakes if thinking I could use it to secure part of the towel like turbi twist but the loop should be elastic/more secure than some silky material loop.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I like the fabric of the towel, especially with my curly hair. The reason I gave it a low rating is because it's not big enough for my long hair. I was expecting something along the lines of being able to wrap ALL my hair in the towel and that's not the case, The ends hang out.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
This made the difference for me. My curls would sometimes come out more wavy but using this towel to scrunch my hair after using other deva curl products makes them perfect ringlets. It leaves enough of the product in the hair to get the results you want without the extra weighing it down. I'm gonna buy another one for my boyfriends house
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Awkward size did not allow me to wrap up my shoulder length hair in a turban while drying off --- left my hair ends sticking out even after over a dozen attempts. Would be ideal for chin length or shorter hair. Does help pull out the water better than my normal towel.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
A nice towel but it doesn't make my hair any wavier / curlier than when I air dry it.  It's just a gimmick
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Bought this for my Mom’s long naturally curly hair- she usually lets it air dry. Now she leaves it in the towel awhile after her shampoo/shower, then combs out, and we can DEFINITELY tell a big difference! LESS FRIZZ... actually NO FRIZZ!!! It’s so soft and manageable and so pretty. We live in a dry climate, so it’s a real miracle. THANK YOU!!!
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
Super exited to get this and it works great and is a good size. The only thing I was disappointed about was that the little loop/hook was detached when I got it. If it wasn’t for that I would give this 5 stars.

Don't see a difference in using this or any other towel.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I'm sorry I wasted money on this, it is not big enough at all and is just a glorified regular microfiber towel.  It is definitely not big enough for plopping.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I love how my hair turns out and no more having to use my shirt from the previous day. Just by scrunching my hair up, it already dries a little and makes it more curly. The only downside is that it could be bigger. My hair barely fits all the way. I have hair that is almost mid-back and have 2c/3a type of hair.

"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I'll start off why I liked it.. The package was pretty, and the towel is very soft.  However, I have pretty long hair (mid back) and it is not big enough, so if you have long hair and you don't want hair hanging out, don't buy.  I also have pretty frizzy and waving hair and it's also very thick and I wanted to buy this because I heard good reviews about how it helped dry hair faster and make it less frizzy. I will say it dried my hair a little faster, but it is still just as frizzy, which is very dissapponting because I feel like I spent a lot of money on something that does not work

I love my Deva towel.  Soaks up the water without snagging my curls.
"
"DevaCurl Deva-Towel Gray Microfiber, 1 Count","
I owned the older version of this Devatowel and have purchased many a cheap microfiber towel for my hair and face before, but this is the highest quality one I've ever purchased.- gorgeous silver color. covers up discoloration that can build up from hair product- fabric hook for hanging towel- large! 3x bigger than any microfiber hair towel I've seen on the market- sublimely softThere are some reviews complaining that this towel is not large enough. I personally only use for scrunching, not for wrapping my head in the towel. I've found doing that pulls out too much water and makes my hair frizzy. For those complaining about frizziness, it's important to understand the porosity of your hair. You may want to put your product into soaking wet hair, then dry with the towel or only pull out some of the moisture, not all. Try scrunching from the top down or the bottom up. Curly hair is trial and error!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I'm disappointed that this book wasn't what I thought it would be. I hoped for more technical information and techniques, and less guru style fluff.If you are struggling to accept your hair, it's a bit Chicken-Soup for the Soul, with the Curly Confessions, and the 12 Steps Promise (to not abuse your hair anymore) and the hair horoscopes.I was personally hoping for more balanced insight on porous/texture aspects of hair rather than main focus on the shape of each curl.I will say I found the hairstyles nice to include, as well as the recipes for protein masks and diy gel spray, and tips for cutting your own hair, but I was disappointed that none of the videos were supported by my device.Overall, not for me, and there is as much if not more info in blogs that don't cost $10.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
It is not possible to give advice about care for every type of curly hair, since individuals' hair varies widely.  However, this book attempts to classify several different types of curls and gives some general principles that the reader can apply, through trial and error, to find out what works best for her (or his) own curly head.If not properly cared for, much curly hair does not appear curly but just frizzy, poufy, flyaway, and out of control. If this describes your hair, it's possible that you have curls and don't know it.  Much of the hair care advice that we get for straight hair is actually the opposite of what should be done for curly hair, so if you start the Curly Girl regimen, you might be surprised to find that you actually do have natural curls.But that's only half the book.  The other half is a sort of manifesto.  Apparently, very many people with curly hair have had traumatic experiences where they did not know how to care for their hair nor did anyone else (such as their mothers and hairdressers).  Some were told their hair was unruly, wrong, ""I can't do anything with it,"" or ""unprofessional.""  Curly hair is treated as a problem to be solved.  There is a strong ideological component to this book, to help naturally curly folks get over the mental block caused by this societal attitude.  Sprinkled throughout the book are testimonies by men and women about how they came to accept their curls. There is even a tongue-in-cheek ""12 Steps"" at the back (some of them somewhat contrived) to lead the reader accept his or her curly hair and commit to care for it as such.There are also numerous ""curl"" puns sprinkled throughout.  The tone is light, like a woman's magazine article extended to book length.I thought the curly-as-identity stuff was a little heavy-handed.  One of the women, in her testimony, even refers to it as the ""curly girl religion"" (unless that was a typo for regimen), and that's not too far off the mark.  I am naturally curly, but I don't think of myself as belonging to a victim class.  Still, the book has good information about hair care, and I can imagine that some people might have a very hard time giving up straightening their hair, and would need all the identity stuff as an encouragement.  The strong ideological tone grew out of the author's own experience of starting out hating, and then learning to love, her hair.According to the book, an estimated 65% of women have hair that has some amount of natural curl to it (varying from waves to ""fractal"" curls).  I can only imagine that very many of them must be straightening theirs.  Although I don't by any means think of straight-haired folks as oppressors nor do I want anyone with straight hair to feel inferior either, I do hope that an increasing number of curly-haired women decide to go natural, so that curly hair can become as normal, professional, and serious a look as straight.

I have always had what others refer to as 'The Bush' as in this wad of curly frizz on my head. Now my hairs mellowed out into what looks like long beach curls. Or so I've been told. Either way I used a few techniques from this book, like how to cut my hair without fraying it. Using oils while it's drying so that there's no frizz. And realizing that I don't need to use shampoo, which is still scary to me.What I really like about the book is that it doesn't read like a manual. It reads like someone with experience is telling you how to take car of your hair. It has relate able stories from fellow curly girls, about their curls. Hair style ideas, and even a Curly Girl Horoscope. My physical copy came with a DVD too, for those that need visuals when cutting their own hair or styling it.On the downside, my hairdresser thinks I'm a snob now. Because I want my hair cut dry, and I show her exactly where to cut. This book gave me too much confidence/authority over my hair. Read at your own risk.

I have hair like Natasha Lyonne, 2c/3a curls. I can see how a lot of these tips work for other people, especially very curly hair. I have frizzy, upon frizzy, upon frizzy, wavy/swavy sometimes curly hair with seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis (weird oily/dry scalp).Edit: I'm changing my review from a 4 to a 5. To those who feel discouraged, there is hope! Since the first time I reviewed the book I cut about 10 inches of my hair off. It rests at my shoulders now, and is a lot easier to experiment with since there is so much less of it. As of May 2015, no heating tools have touched my head, and it has worked out very nicely! It is almost the end of the summer and I have not cursed the humidity once.I'm still using a sulfate-free shampoo (AG Fast Food Shampoo), and I switch between Tresemme Un(done) conditioner (silicone and glycerin free) and Yes to Carrots conditioner. I use a leave-in conditioner and Ouidad Climate Control Gel (alcohol free). Navigating the curly hair products has been a lot easier after reading this book, and I think its a good resource for anyone who wants better curls.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
It's hard to believe after a lifetime of frustration I've actually found a system that's not only helped me love my curly hair, I absolutely no longer covet straight hair.  I now feel like the one who is to be envied!  Every (no exaggeration) single time I go out I now get compliments on my hair...what a wonderful feeling.  And those compliments come not only from those who've known me forever; the most gratifying compliments come from total strangers.  Wow.When you try this method, all I can say is absorb the advice and follow it--doing so has indeed changed the way I feel about myself.  It has SO boosted my self-confidence.  I have been going 'natural' for years and had terrible frustrations over the omnipresent frizz and dried-out hair.  No longer--even on rainy, humid days.I have my hair colored--soon after initially getting it colored I started having a terrible time with extreme dryness.  My hairdresser insisted the coloring had nothing to do with it, but I know better now.  This book confirmed my suspicions, but the dryness is in the past now, after using the types of products suggested, and understanding more about my hair.  The book does not push a particular brand of products but explains ingredients to avoid.  Having said that, I have to admit I now use nothing but the product line developed by the author--DevaCurl.  Some products of the line I like better than others, and they are not inexpensive, but they work--along with following what the book tells you to do.  I started out trying one of their 'kits', which included smaller (8 oz) bottles of cleanser, conditioner and a small microfiber towel because it was a less expensive way to try the products...at least that way I could see if they worked without going overboard.  They worked.  I also have tried lots of additional DevaCurl products by buying when they offer specials--where your purchase also gets you small containers of other DevaCurl products.  As I stated earlier, some I like better than others, but that you must determine for yourself.  Rather than buying a large microfiber towel, I use a large cotton man's t-shirt, as suggested in the book, and that works great.  The book also provides recipes so you can make your own products--I haven't tried that, but I certainly love the DevaCurl stuff, so I just buy those.The lady who wrote this book has become a hero (or heroine) to thousands, and rightfully so.  She is certainly one of mine.  I even went to the website and found an area that shows you where to find hairdressers who have been trained in using her method (which includes dry-cutting your hair--makes such perfect sense--read the book--when hair is cut wet you have no idea how each curl is going to dry).  I live in a rural mountain area and now drive 75 miles each way to get my hair cut/colored by someone who understands and gives a s**t about how to deal with curly hair.  Fortunately, I only have to go every 10-12 weeks...part of the benefit of a proper cut, and the curl helps hide the roots.Didn't mean to write so much, but the method this book describes should be mandatory for every hairdresser and every curly-haired person out there.  I don't think you can go wrong if you use this system.  I'd almost pay people to read this book.

I found some great advice for my wavy hair. I'm a wash and go girl, and prefer naturals, so I appreciate the perspective that encouraging healthy hair with good, natural ingredients and no fuss is the best way to shine. The guide helps you identify what your hair type is (wavy, curly, coily etc.) then gives a care and style program. It requires spending a little money and going outside the normal drugstore aisle to find good products, but there are excellent products out there that won't break the bank. Already got compliments on my hair after trying some of the practical advice.

Lorraine really goes into great detail and care to teach you how to take care of your hair! Every little tip helps my hair feel better, look better and gives me so much confidence! I was raised to straighten my hair, so when I learned how to let it go natural I was amazed! It's so much easier to take care of and every hair day is a good one! I am no longer scared of raining day frizz! What a relief! It's only been a week, but I am dedicated to loving my hair the way it is intended to be. Also check out Lorraine Massey's ""Silver Hair"" as she teaches you how to grow out your color and say goodbye to dye!

At nearly 60 I am a beginner with my curly hair. I've always kept it very short to deal with unmanageable curl (I thought) and to avoid heat and chemicals. This is a new life adventure for me and I am having much fun and success with these methods. I might explore Devacurl products but any no sulphate, parade, silicone or alcohol products may work for you as they do for me using these methods.The DVDs work great on iPad plus you get the full color photos.

It's a bit cutesy and juvenile with all the plays on words, etc. Some of the curl styles are also a bit too similar to be considered distinct, but I really appreciated the washing and drying tips (which REALLY do work to maximize curls and avoid frizz), plus the lack of YOU MUST BUY THESE DEVA PRODUCTS upsell that so many other style guides push. The recipes are also a nice add, though I haven't tried them yet. It was a fun read and having been to a Deva-certified stylist a few times now, I'm sold on the method. My hair's never looked better and been so easy to style, even when I travel overseas. I actually do use 3 of the Deva products (and happily so). Thanks Lorraine!

First off, I give the seller 5 stars for quick delivery and item being in flawless condition. However, that doesn't apply to the book. I am trying to go back to my curly hair and everyone on Youtube and well...the whole internet practically highly recommend this book. I do appreciate the tips given and without reading it, I would have thought the curly lifestyle was going to be too complicated. So that helped simplify things in that instance but the book still lacked something. If I hadn't come across curl friends talking about hair porosity, I would've never known about it, especially there being no mention about it anywhere that I found in this book. To me, porosity is a huge importance learning about your hair, the products to use and application. The author only covers how to take care of your curls by curl shapes, not porosity and someone with low porosity, I was in a constant battle with products and application. I am NOT saying that this book is absolutely useless, just wish there was less testimonials and more information on products and porosity...more science, I guess.  I recommend going to the library and checking out the book before buying it, that way you can be sure if it's something you can't live without going back to curls.

I'm disappointed that this book wasn't what I thought it would be. I hoped for more technical information and techniques, and less guru style fluff.If you are struggling to accept your hair, it's a bit Chicken-Soup for the Soul, with the Curly Confessions, and the 12 Steps Promise (to not abuse your hair anymore) and the hair horoscopes.I was personally hoping for more balanced insight on porous/texture aspects of hair rather than main focus on the shape of each curl.I will say I found the hairstyles nice to include, as well as the recipes for protein masks and diy gel spray, and tips for cutting your own hair, but I was disappointed that none of the videos were supported by my device.Overall, not for me, and there is as much if not more info in blogs that don't cost $10.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
It is not possible to give advice about care for every type of curly hair, since individuals' hair varies widely.  However, this book attempts to classify several different types of curls and gives some general principles that the reader can apply, through trial and error, to find out what works best for her (or his) own curly head.If not properly cared for, much curly hair does not appear curly but just frizzy, poufy, flyaway, and out of control. If this describes your hair, it's possible that you have curls and don't know it.  Much of the hair care advice that we get for straight hair is actually the opposite of what should be done for curly hair, so if you start the Curly Girl regimen, you might be surprised to find that you actually do have natural curls.But that's only half the book.  The other half is a sort of manifesto.  Apparently, very many people with curly hair have had traumatic experiences where they did not know how to care for their hair nor did anyone else (such as their mothers and hairdressers).  Some were told their hair was unruly, wrong, ""I can't do anything with it,"" or ""unprofessional.""  Curly hair is treated as a problem to be solved.  There is a strong ideological component to this book, to help naturally curly folks get over the mental block caused by this societal attitude.  Sprinkled throughout the book are testimonies by men and women about how they came to accept their curls. There is even a tongue-in-cheek ""12 Steps"" at the back (some of them somewhat contrived) to lead the reader accept his or her curly hair and commit to care for it as such.There are also numerous ""curl"" puns sprinkled throughout.  The tone is light, like a woman's magazine article extended to book length.I thought the curly-as-identity stuff was a little heavy-handed.  One of the women, in her testimony, even refers to it as the ""curly girl religion"" (unless that was a typo for regimen), and that's not too far off the mark.  I am naturally curly, but I don't think of myself as belonging to a victim class.  Still, the book has good information about hair care, and I can imagine that some people might have a very hard time giving up straightening their hair, and would need all the identity stuff as an encouragement.  The strong ideological tone grew out of the author's own experience of starting out hating, and then learning to love, her hair.According to the book, an estimated 65% of women have hair that has some amount of natural curl to it (varying from waves to ""fractal"" curls).  I can only imagine that very many of them must be straightening theirs.  Although I don't by any means think of straight-haired folks as oppressors nor do I want anyone with straight hair to feel inferior either, I do hope that an increasing number of curly-haired women decide to go natural, so that curly hair can become as normal, professional, and serious a look as straight.

I have always had what others refer to as 'The Bush' as in this wad of curly frizz on my head. Now my hairs mellowed out into what looks like long beach curls. Or so I've been told. Either way I used a few techniques from this book, like how to cut my hair without fraying it. Using oils while it's drying so that there's no frizz. And realizing that I don't need to use shampoo, which is still scary to me.What I really like about the book is that it doesn't read like a manual. It reads like someone with experience is telling you how to take car of your hair. It has relate able stories from fellow curly girls, about their curls. Hair style ideas, and even a Curly Girl Horoscope. My physical copy came with a DVD too, for those that need visuals when cutting their own hair or styling it.On the downside, my hairdresser thinks I'm a snob now. Because I want my hair cut dry, and I show her exactly where to cut. This book gave me too much confidence/authority over my hair. Read at your own risk.

I have hair like Natasha Lyonne, 2c/3a curls. I can see how a lot of these tips work for other people, especially very curly hair. I have frizzy, upon frizzy, upon frizzy, wavy/swavy sometimes curly hair with seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis (weird oily/dry scalp).Edit: I'm changing my review from a 4 to a 5. To those who feel discouraged, there is hope! Since the first time I reviewed the book I cut about 10 inches of my hair off. It rests at my shoulders now, and is a lot easier to experiment with since there is so much less of it. As of May 2015, no heating tools have touched my head, and it has worked out very nicely! It is almost the end of the summer and I have not cursed the humidity once.I'm still using a sulfate-free shampoo (AG Fast Food Shampoo), and I switch between Tresemme Un(done) conditioner (silicone and glycerin free) and Yes to Carrots conditioner. I use a leave-in conditioner and Ouidad Climate Control Gel (alcohol free). Navigating the curly hair products has been a lot easier after reading this book, and I think its a good resource for anyone who wants better curls.

It's hard to believe after a lifetime of frustration I've actually found a system that's not only helped me love my curly hair, I absolutely no longer covet straight hair.  I now feel like the one who is to be envied!  Every (no exaggeration) single time I go out I now get compliments on my hair...what a wonderful feeling.  And those compliments come not only from those who've known me forever; the most gratifying compliments come from total strangers.  Wow.When you try this method, all I can say is absorb the advice and follow it--doing so has indeed changed the way I feel about myself.  It has SO boosted my self-confidence.  I have been going 'natural' for years and had terrible frustrations over the omnipresent frizz and dried-out hair.  No longer--even on rainy, humid days.I have my hair colored--soon after initially getting it colored I started having a terrible time with extreme dryness.  My hairdresser insisted the coloring had nothing to do with it, but I know better now.  This book confirmed my suspicions, but the dryness is in the past now, after using the types of products suggested, and understanding more about my hair.  The book does not push a particular brand of products but explains ingredients to avoid.  Having said that, I have to admit I now use nothing but the product line developed by the author--DevaCurl.  Some products of the line I like better than others, and they are not inexpensive, but they work--along with following what the book tells you to do.  I started out trying one of their 'kits', which included smaller (8 oz) bottles of cleanser, conditioner and a small microfiber towel because it was a less expensive way to try the products...at least that way I could see if they worked without going overboard.  They worked.  I also have tried lots of additional DevaCurl products by buying when they offer specials--where your purchase also gets you small containers of other DevaCurl products.  As I stated earlier, some I like better than others, but that you must determine for yourself.  Rather than buying a large microfiber towel, I use a large cotton man's t-shirt, as suggested in the book, and that works great.  The book also provides recipes so you can make your own products--I haven't tried that, but I certainly love the DevaCurl stuff, so I just buy those.The lady who wrote this book has become a hero (or heroine) to thousands, and rightfully so.  She is certainly one of mine.  I even went to the website and found an area that shows you where to find hairdressers who have been trained in using her method (which includes dry-cutting your hair--makes such perfect sense--read the book--when hair is cut wet you have no idea how each curl is going to dry).  I live in a rural mountain area and now drive 75 miles each way to get my hair cut/colored by someone who understands and gives a s**t about how to deal with curly hair.  Fortunately, I only have to go every 10-12 weeks...part of the benefit of a proper cut, and the curl helps hide the roots.Didn't mean to write so much, but the method this book describes should be mandatory for every hairdresser and every curly-haired person out there.  I don't think you can go wrong if you use this system.  I'd almost pay people to read this book.

I found some great advice for my wavy hair. I'm a wash and go girl, and prefer naturals, so I appreciate the perspective that encouraging healthy hair with good, natural ingredients and no fuss is the best way to shine. The guide helps you identify what your hair type is (wavy, curly, coily etc.) then gives a care and style program. It requires spending a little money and going outside the normal drugstore aisle to find good products, but there are excellent products out there that won't break the bank. Already got compliments on my hair after trying some of the practical advice.

After having very straight hair my entire life for the last few years it has been a triangular fuzz ball no matter who cut and styled it. I tried different hair professionals. When I saw this book it all clicked! I went to beauty school back in the day before my hair turned grey. Just by looking at the front of the book I new I had wavy/curly hair and had been destroying it by treating it as straight hair. It is a easy read and informative book. Straight and wavycurly hair are totally different worlds. Plenty on you tube about the 'curly girl method CGM' for more help. However all that information on you tube is confusing since every curl is different. The book was most helpful in narrowing down what info was for my hair type. 2abc and on a good day I have a couple 3a curls. All you need to know if you are a new curly. There are a lot of people who have fuzzy hair who don't know that frizzy fuzz is actually curlywavy hair that needs to be cared for properly so you can enjoy your natural hair.

This is definitely a must have book for anyone who has curly hair that has never really known how to properly take care of it. I grew up with a mother who has pin straight hair, an older sister with pin straight hair, and a father and little sister who has curly hair. You'd think since the curlies are dominant in the family that we would all know how to take care of our hair right? Wrong. Since my father was never the one to ""doll"" me up as a kid my hair was always straightened and styled as my mother had done her own hair. It wasn't until middle school that I discovered I actually had curly hair, but still I didn't have much help. Most days I just slathered gel into my hair and put it up in a pony tail high on my head. It wasn't until high school that I discovered the wonderul world of flat irons and blow dryers! Oh the awful things I did to my hair to make it as straight as I could, and I dreaded PE class and rainy days. I spent almost a good 10 years straightening my hair until I finally decided to give in and wear it curly because I had realized how ridiculous it was to spend so many hours on my hair! I've been wearing my hair curly for about a year now and it's definitely been a battle. I've spent a lot of hours on the internet trying to do my own research watching many many youtube videos, reading blogs, etc. I was a product junkie, buying things left and right thinking they did wonders on others hair, maybe they will do wonders on my own! It wasn't the case. It wasn't until I moved from Phoenix, AZ to Seattle, WA that I decided I had had enough, the amount of frizz I was dealing with because of rain or humidity was super frustrating. This book hasn't ""solved"" my problems, but it definitely gave me a lot of useful information towards helping care for my hair properly - basically every product I'd been using on my hair was a big no-no. If you can relate to any of my story, and are still struggling, I strongly recommend you purchase this book and give it a read. My hair isn't perfect yet, but I've only been at it for about a week or two, but I've noticed dramatic change in the shape of my curls. My hair is extremely dry and damaged from blow drying and dying so it will be a bit of a process.Bottom line...those that know me well, know I've struggled my whole life trying to tame this mane, and it's not been easy... oh the crazy things I've done, the many hours I've spent trying to make sure every strand was perfectly in place - and oh the many terrible haircuts from stylists having no idea how to manage my hair... the many tears shed. I've finally decided to embrace my crazy hair and start loving it how it should be loved. This book has a lot of useful information for curly hair. Please understand what works for some, may not work for everyone, but it's a learning experience! Don't expect this book to be a miracle worker and solve all your problems for you. It's meant as a guideline to help learn what works best for you, and remember it's going to take time a lot of practice, but I know once we get the hang of this it will all be worth it!

Loved, loved, loved this book.  Followed the recommendations and my frizzy hair has turned into beautiful curls.  I did buy the Curly Girl products  which really helped make a difference.  While I did notice a difference in the frizz factor immediately,  my curls were more wavy to start with but got curlier as my hair adjusted to the new regime.

I just took up the CG method and this book totally opened my eyes to how to take care of my curly hair. I had no idea my hair could look so incredibly healthy and the curls could be so defined. The book is great because all the models look like real/non photoshopped models, and they're all different ethnicities. There's even a whole chapter on ""multi-curl-tural"" hair!If you have curly hair and have always had trouble making it beautiful and healthy, I would HIGHLY recommend this book. You won't regret it.

LOVED this!  As a self-proclaimed beauty junkie (first step is admitting you have a problem, right?) that has accumulated WAY TOO MUCH beauty/hair products throughout the last 15ish years. But I don't know much at all concerning the ""curly girl method"" and wanted to look into it after my stylist told me it would make my hair much softer and stronger. Blogs I found were all contradictory, so i bought this book as all referred to it as the Bible of curly hair. It is detailed yet manageable, making it much more simple to understand than I had anticipated. Massey walks the reader through, step by step, how to eat care for curly hair. Her chapter on products did unfortunately lead me to spend more money on more products (last thing i needed!), but they have been game changers. Highly recommend!!

This book is an excellent start.  My daughter has very curly hair and it has always been fuzzy.  Don't think that following their directions will necessarily give you instant results--my daughter's hair needed time to heal I think.  It has steadily gotten more and more formed in the curls.  I followed up with looking at some posts by curly headed-girls who encouraged being flexible with your own hair and with the directions given here.  Sulfate-free is a must, and the major stores (Target, Wally World, etc.) carry a lot of great products now, and they don't cost an arm and leg.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
PROS• Well written and well-edited, with a spirited and happy voice and cute puns throughout.• Clear instructions, with photos. You wouldn't think an adult would need this for hair washing and conditioning, but it's a totally different approach than what we learned from say, Prell commercials or Cosmo, and the author gets that, offering the necessary level of detail.• Admirably, doesn't push a specific brand of hair care. As Massey has founded two lines of such products, she easily could insist they are the only ones that work, so she scores credibility points for instead listing general ingredients to avoid, and others that are beneficial for curl cultivation.• This method really does work. My hair has never looked better. But...and this is a big one:DEAL-BREAKING CON• My skin has never looked worse....And yes, I keep my hair off my face at night by 'pineappling' it....And yes, I follow an impeccable skincare routine that includes exfoliating products.Until I read this book, I had my hair in a scrunchy bun all the time, as its texture was too weird to leave down. On the 'Curly Girl' method, its texture is sheaves of soft curls. But as they spill like rumpled silk over my shoulders, these highly conditioned curls also rest on the sides of my face. There, particulates of the un-rinsed conditioner and of the palms-full of gel saturating their cuticles transfer to my facial skin's clean, unassuming pores....And of that unholy union comes acne. I never had acne before starting Curly Girl, not even in my teens. A week and a half on this method and it's pimple city, they are rampant.It's as if we each have a set point for attractiveness, and the universe is saying: Sure, you can find a way to have nice hair, but doing so will ruin your skin, to keep you humble.

First thing I want to say: When you are reading ratings for products check the date of the reviews! They can be 10 years old and the product may have been changed five times. Book reviews don’t matter but if it is something you need up to date info., check the publication date.I have never been given anything including a discount for any of my reviews!I recommend this book even if you don’t have curly hair. This book is inexpensive and is full of information for anyone who cares about their hair.For example: No one should cut your hair wet. Especially curly hair. DO NOT ket someone use shampoo after they color or highlight your hair.High dollar salons sure seem to almost always to both.This book is wonderful. Learned so much about curly hair and hair products in general. There is so much in all the commercial products they use in marketing that actual make anyone’s hair worse, not better.My advice is that if it sounds like some chemical formula that you don’t know what it is, avoid that product.The following actually apply to anyone’s hair:Avoid products with silicone which is in just about every “shine” product because they are MADE to REPEL water.Avoid gels with any alcohol, silicone, parabens, and phthlates.“All Natural” is misleading. Something may be natural like hydrochloric acid but I don’t want it in my hair!Avoid shampoos with sulfates which you may already know.Look for products that contain shea butter, jojoba oil, olive oil, vegetable oils,  cetyl esters, aloe vera, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and sorbitol. You can find these single ingredients inexpensively on this site.My hair improved in one week after I quit using the stuff that was supposedly making it better. My hair is long and it had started to tangle so badly, I had to brush it before washing it, after conditioner and after I got out. The hair detangler allowed me to get it combed through when I used it but made it even worse in the long run.

Okay....so this book I’ve been really wanting to get for soooo long. But I have put it off until Hair Romance said it had good tips. It’s been one of those things that I’m like “Do I really need it!?” I could spend the money on products instead of a book and products would help me out much more than a $15 or $10 book would, right? Not really! Even though I watched years worth of videos from YouTube they will never equate to this book. Even though there are some things in the book that are a waste off time to read...(if you’re desperate like myself)....for example all of the curly girl testimonials but hay there’s much more... and you don’t have to read everything! Skim over it the first or second time like I did! Love the natural recipes in it (not a lot mind you) but very good tips. This book it where I found my grounding so I’d recommend getting it!The quality of the books actual material and design:Okay this part I’m not entirely impressed...the paper is the rubbery type that will leave a rippled finger print on it....and the paper has a plastic coating so it is easy to get a glare from the lighting. So that’s honestly quite annoying for me... I’m kind of picky when it comes to reading lol.  Hope this was helpful!

Changed my perspective on using gels. I am African so I was very skeptical as to applying gel to my hair...little did I knew that it would change my hair.This book has greatly simplified my washday routine and styling method. Be warned not much on each specific type of hair, about two pages, but still.Have yet to go over the CD-R.

I was so excited to get this book.  Unfortunately--while it was an easy and pleasant read--the methods didn't work for me.  I tried the Curly Girl methods for a good number of years, but ended up with the most unruly hair that I have ever had in my life.  It constantly tied itself into knots.  Eventually, I went for the big chop and started over, using my old routine again.  Nevertheless, I appreciate the idea of making peace with your own natural curls.  Long before this book, I have been sporting my natural curls.  I was just hoping for an easier routine.  This was not easier at all.  I found it tedious, as though my hair had special needs and was running my life.

This book is probably best for those who are still coming to terms with loving their natural hair, as a large portion of it is repeated stories about how your curls are awesome. If you've already come to acceptance of your not-straight hair, this book may get real old, real fast. There are a ton of personal testimonials, 'cutesy' repeated slang terms like ""hair fryer"" (instead of hair dryer), and so on, and it does not let up over the course of the book.I wish instead there had been more about modifications beyond the One True Way outlined in the book:- She sniffs at the thought that you might not be able to spend the needed time on your hair in the morning, but what if your hair is very thick and takes forever to air dry? Some discussion of night-before washing and hair prep methods would have been useful; using a diffuser or your car's heater may work for some people but isn't always feasible.- The sole mention of dandruff is essentially 'see a dermatologist' - well yes, but what about suggestions to try to mitigate the curl-busting effects of what might be necessary (and hopefully temporary) use of harsh shampoos or treatments?- The hair spritz for scalp ""cleaning"" between washing says you should use lavender, but it can be irritating to skin (especially in sunlight) and doesn't really seem to have any true cleansing effects. Another oil option would have been nice.I do give her credit for not turning the book into one big ad for her hair products line (DevaCurl), as well as for providing some DIY product instructions if you're into that.I've seen complaints that the videos don't work on Kindle, but they do work in the Kindle for iPad app, for those interested.

I have started the CGM and enjoyed most of the content outlined in the book. I have a few disagreements but will use much of what I learned in my hair journey. As with any book, how-to-guide I take it with a grain of salt. I am not a die-hard and will not “obey” every rule outlined in this book but most was very good solid advice for caring and cultivating curls/waves in one’s hair. I am a 2b wavy girl. I use sulfate free shampoo periodically, I brush my hair in the shower, and I sleep on a regular cotton pillowcase with my hair free...these are not really recommended by true CGM standards, but it works for me and my lifestyle. Still I am grateful for Lorraine Massey and her passion to help curly and wavy girls realize that the hair God blessed them with is actually what looks best on them and to be brave enough to let their natural beauty shine out for all to see :)

Having wavy hair and a daughter with really curly hair, I had to get this book. I'm so glad I did. Some of the book is really cheesy, like using ""hair"" sayings to make a point like ""self mane-tenance"" or ""It's all about Hue!"" or another, ""The down and dirty root-ine"".  Gag. I am not a fan of playing on words. She did it throughout the entire book. Drove me nuts after awhile. Also, I got this book for my daughter and the quiz at the beginning had some questions that didn't really apply to a pre-teen, like ""Do you live in fear of humidity, sweating, spontaneous sex, a shower with your lover...""  Yeah, she doesn't need to read that. Not only that, the author assumes that us girls with curly or wavy hair, hate our hair. I don't hate my hair. She also suggests throwing away your straightener. What? No. What if I want a different look? Straight haired girls curl their hair so what is wrong with me straightening mine? Just silly.I do like the book though because it had a lot of tips for making my hair look better. I gave up shampoo and boy did that make a difference! I would have never known. I also like her ideas for making my hair more curly/wavy. I didn't even use the DVD because honestly, the book did a great job of describing how to make my hair work for me. I recommend this book to any person who has curly or wavy hair. It really helped me and I do love my hair a little more, even if I think the author is a corn ball.

While I realize this book was primarily written to sell the Deva haircare products (which are fabulous), there's a lot of good styling tips in this book.  In the past, one of the problems of being a curly head is the lack of good styling products, but also a lack of good technique.  I was lucky and got it on sale for $1.99 kindle price, so I certainly got my money's worth.  For example, I never thought to use clips to give volume to the top of my hair at the crown.  The videos were helpful what with Picture.ThousandWords and all.  So I highly recommend this for the styling techniques, especially for keeping the curls defined and losing the frizz.The book is liberally sprinkled with curly hair confessionals where various women write of their apparent trauma of having curly hair.  As someone who never had an issue with her curly hair (because I realized early on a lot of women spend a much time and small fortune trying to achieve what I was just lucky enough to be born with!) I didn't find these particularly enlightening.  But I suppose if one has fought against their hair, or had been teased about it, these might be of some comfort to know you're not alone.  Acceptance is a good thing!It loses a star because the book actually contains a section regarding horoscopes and your hair.  Seriously!  But I suppose if someone is the kind of person who both knows their astrological sign (but probably not their blood type) and believes that the position of planets, stars and constellations in the sky have some meaning to your hair, this might be helpful to them.  For me it was laughable waste of space.

Recently decided to commit to my curly hair.  This book doesn't really help all that much.  I found it difficult to determine my curl type from this (and author states it's likely you have more than one type) so also difficult to know which protocol to follow.  What I struggle with the most is knowing how much of product to use and which products are best for my curly hair.  I've been experimenting with both protocols and products.  So far, I've eliminated a lot through trial and error bit still on the hunt for what works best.  Watching YouTube videos has been much more helpful than this book.

This book has made such a difference as I’ve let go of keeping my hair straight. I only wish I found it sooner. If you’re wondering how to work with your natural hair texture instead of trying to beat it into submission, start here.When you’re done with this book and you’re still trying to find the right products, application and technique to bring out your best curls, buy Scott Musgrave’s online class The MAP Method. Yes, they’re are wonderful and free online resources but the information can be conflicting, daunting, and time consuming to sort through. Scott cuts to the chase and helps you understand your hair now. So, for about $115 (the cost of this book plus Scott’s class) and a month of your time while you study and practice, you can have beautiful, healthy hair you never dreamed you could have. That’s cheap folks. Us gals spend more than that on a single trip to the salon for a cut and color.

I live in Colorado and have a lot of problems with my hair the last few years. It's so dry here, and with the high altitude, it's almost impossible to keep my wavy/curly hair hydrated, un-frizzed, and looking good. A couple of years ago I switched to using Wen as my wash/conditioner, and used some of the other Wen products to help with frizz and hydration. For awhile the products worked really well for me, but the last year, I've had less than stellar results. Also, the products keep going up in price, and I felt like I was spending a fortune just to keep my hair in okay shape.I am so glad I stumbled on this book! It has changed my curly hair life, saved me a ton of money, and my hair hasn't looked this good in I don't know how long. I followed the techniques outlined in the handbook, and with just a little experimenting with amounts of conditioner and gel, my hair is looking fantastic, feels hydrated, isn't a frizzy mess, and feels good to the touch. I'm using a sulfate-free shampoo and botanical conditioner by Alba, about $10 each at my local health food store, a higher end gel, and a little bit of leave-in conditioner/styling elixir by 2Chic. None of the products are super expensive as compared to what I was using before, and I think the technique and products work well together. I shampoo as per the instructions, then condition. It took a few washes to get the amount of conditioner and how much I was rinsing out right, but it was worth the experimentation. I scrunch a couple of times after the shower, add my gel, scrunch once, then add my elixir and scrunch a final time. The only thing with this process is that it takes my hair awhile to dry.I love the homemade recipes in the book, and the tips for styling. Again, affordable and easy to make recipes, and simple styling tips. This is the best purchase I've made for my hair in a very long time. Get the book, follow the instructions for your curl type, experiment for a few washes, and after 2-3 weeks, you'll be surprised at how much difference there is. I could see a little improvement after one wash, but after refining my process and what I'm using on my hair, there's an enormous difference.

This is an excellent starting point if you are trying to embrace your waves and curls and don't know where to begin. I have naturally thick, wavy hair that I have been flat ironing daily for years now and I am over it. It takes me hours! A friend recommended this book to me and I love it. Lots of pictures with step by step instructions, which is exactly what I need. Mine even came with a DVD and I plan to watch it. Is this book totally comprehensive? No. I don't think that's even possible! But it Is definitely something I will be referencing as I learn and then will pass on eventually. If you are just starting, start here!

This is a very informative, encouraging book for those who have decided to embrace their beautiful God-given  curly hair. It's not easy! For those of us who have been made fun of (Brillo pad!), had our hair cut short by our parents, and spent hours straightening out hair only to walk outside and instantly lose the style to frizz and poof, it requires a complete change in the way we think about our hair. But when a stranger stops you and says, ""I just have to tell you - your hair is awesome!"" Well, it's all worth it. (No one ever told me that in all the years I spent blow drying and trying to control my hair.) Pretty soon you are looking in the mirror and realizing your hair IS awesome! So glad I found this book and embraced my curls.

Game chager. I've been using her product line Deva Curl but doing it my own way until I got this book. Amazing results. I have gotten so many more compliments for my curly hair. Even my stylist asked me what I was doing. I now tell every curly girl and every closet curly girl (aka straightens her hair every day and prays it doesn't rain) about this book. I love my curly hair and this just makes it amazing and non-crunchy. It's a lot to get used to at first but it's worth it. It takes a long time for my hair to dry after washing but on the non-washing days hair care is a breeze and looks even better than the washing days! The books is very curl-centric and anti straightening your hair ever-but it's easy to get past that. Love that she explains the why behind what you should and shouldn't do. I accidentally used a prior product (silk drops) on a non-washing day and looked at the ingredients after I used it; there was a huge difference. Who knew the products I was using to tame my hair were a huge part of the problem.

All the info I desperately needed and wonderfully reassuring to find out I am not alone in my years of misery at the hands of stylists.  My hair has been in a very very bad way for too long and nothing seemed to be working.  Two weeks in and maybe not the most perfect routine yet but my curls are starting to amaze me.  Instead of a tangle of dry sad frizz there are these defined curls.  My only wish is that there was an index, to help me get back to specific how to parts easier.  I wish I would have found this book years ago.  Somethings I already knew but so much I did not.  Highly recommended!!

This book is a great help to people who have curly hair and don't know what to do with it. Unlike most of the people who give testimonies in the book, I did not have curly hair my whole life. I ended up with curly hair after losing all of my hair from chemotherapy treatments. When my hair finally grew back in, it came in a completely different color and in tight corkscrew curls! I read the Curly Girl handbook, followed the instructions and found that my hair definitely looked better. I confess that I didn't always understand how to do the various techniques just by reading and looking at the pictures, so I searched for a nearby salon that might be able to teach the techniques hands-on. The salon I found has two stylists who actually went to New York and were trained by Lorraine Massey. I came away from my appointment with a clear understanding of how to care for my hair - how much conditioner and gel to use, how to use clips to lift and accentuate my curls, how to dry my hair with a diffuser, how to rejuvenate my curls on the second and third days, etc.  And my hair has looked great ever since!

This book is for woman who have yet to proficiently take care of their curls. You must have literally little to no knowledge at all of how to maintain, brush, wash, and cut your hair. Much of this handbook is composed of common sense, and the rest lacking thereof. It's quite a let down since it came highly recommended... but again, if you are confident in your current abilities, don't fool yourself and think you'll learn anything new.
"

I picked up this book because I desperately need to know how to care for my curls. The book is extremely informative on how to identify what kind of curls you have and how to treat and maintain your curls.What I enjoyed most about the book is, even though the author is the creator of the DEVA CURL hair line products, she didn't use this book to promote it. Instead she gave a list of ingredients in hair products to look for and look out for, so you can make your own decisions on what to purchase. She just truly wants you to love your curls!So I just had my first cut from a professional curl stylist, and with the help of this book I plan on going through a curl hair journey! Buy the book, and love your curls.Side note: I purchased the kindle version and enjoyed watching the videos on my kindle app on using my iPad.

This is a must have for anyone who wants to control curly hair. I got this book, and I found a devacurl trained stylist, and my hair never looked better. It has descriptions for all sorts of different curl types, and recommended ways to style. Not much of an exaggeration to say it changed both my and my mother's lives

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have fine, curly hair and have never been proud of my curls...they always felt very lifeless and were hard to take care of (thin and curly hair is not exactly an ideal combination). After having used sulfate laden shampoos and paraben ladedn conditioners until the beginning of this summer, I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend of mine, and out of curiosity. The homemade shampoos and conditioners I was using while effective at detangling, were making my hair limp, oily, and lifeless. I started reading The Curly Girl Handbook and figured out what curls I have (Botticelli) and how to care for them and was very excited. I had no idea curly hair DID have to be treated differently than straight hair.  I read about the DevaCurl products and actually just bought the No Poo and One Conditioner today, and they are a literal miracle; I had oily, lifeless, gross hair and LITERALLY while rinsing the No Poo from my head, my hair changed 100%. It was soft, strong, not weighed down, bouncy, light, etc. AMAZING. The conditioner is equally amazing as it provides SO MUCH nourishment and detangle in such a small amount.Anyway, back to the book. The book is essential for anyone with curly or wavy hair. Lorraine really does understand how unique curly hair is and her mantra is for everyone to embrace their curls, not try to conform to the current idea and standard of beauty (straight hair) and to be proud to have stand out curls. The tips are easy to understand (I especially love the homemade stuff she came up with, like the Lavender Spray) and everything is super easy to do, even down to how exactly you should wash your hair. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this....it's seriously going to change your life, because it did mine....and I'm a proud Curly Girl now!

Loved this book! Had LOTS of great information on curly hair.I’ve had somewhat curly hair all my life. I grew up in the 70’s when straight hair was “in” so I fought my hair all my life.Due to health issues I lost a lot of hair but since it’s grown back, it’s SUPER curly! I decided to quit fighting and embrace it. The curly hair struggle is real if you’re “doing it wrong”! That’s why I bought this book to learn how finally to live with curly hair!  Good book! Even bought an extra one for a gift - she loved it too!

This book is literally LIFE CHANGING.  I have despised my curls since I was a little girl.  But now that I have a curly-headed daughter of my own, I've been trying to teach her to love her hair for years.  Insisting that she loves her curls while frying mine with a flat iron every day seemed hypocritical.I'd been trying to go back to curly for weeks with pretty awful/stringy results so I turned to Google for help.  It turns out that I just needed to understand what my hair really needs.I am still in the funky phase between flat iron/keratin treatments but so far it is amazing.  I can't wait to see how my curls end up once all the damage has been repaired.

I wish this book had been around when I was growing up, it would have made life with my hair a lot easier! I've only been shampoo free for a little over a week but already a co-worker has noticed a difference. More important, it drove home something my 4 year old granddaughter ( a curly girl born of 2 straight hair parents ) said to me at the end of a day spent together. I had straightened my hair that day - something I usually did only once a week as I have been coming to terms with my hair for a couple of years now and figured this was about as good as it was going to get. From the back seat she asked me when my hair was going to look like hers again and I asked her why, don't you like it like this? She said no, I like it better when it's like mine. Out of the mouths of babes! Luckily my daughter is very geared towards the more natural the better and has been shampoo free for over a month and follows the same path with my granddaughter. Thanks to this "" how to "" book, I think I can finally become more comfortable in my own curls and be a better curly hair role model for my granddaughter.

If you have natural curly hair, this is a must read. If your daughter has natural curly hair and you do not, PLEASE get this book for your child's sake! Growing up with a straight-haired mom, my hair really suffered at the hands of brushes and the wrong hair products. Bless my mom, she tried her best, but my hair was always frizzy and massive as a kid. After reading this book and buying the DevaCurl products, my hair has never looked better; my daughter's looks amazing as well with it. The volume for the first time ever is manageable and the curls are each defined and not crispy and crunchy anymore. I've tried every product for curly hair available and still can't believe that all it takes is the deva shampoo, conditioner, and light gel. But the book is a must so you know how to properly wash and dry your hair. Trust me, download the book now!

1) I can appreciate the information in this book.  I do think that the CG Methods are helpful for anyone starting their curly hair journey.  However, most of this information is available online for free.  There was no new information that I haven't already read/seen before.  I would save my money and research.2) I purchased the digital copy of this book.  The book was intended to include videos explaining some of her methods.  The links didn't work.  The format was altogether messy and poorly designed.  Not at all what I would expect from a $9 kindle book.Overall- not worth the investment.

I ordered Curly Girl many years ago and have borrowed it to one too many friends over the years. I still tell anyone who asks about how I take care of my curly hair about this book. Anytime someone new cuts my hair they comment on how healthy it is (which is not common for curly hair). I recently decided that I needed another copy since my first was lost. I also have have a mini curly girl and am happy to provide her with years less of grief over curly hair than I had. This book is SUCH a wonderful tool for anyone with curly hair to have so they can learn how to take care of it properly! If you or your girl has curly hair this book is for you! It is a lifesaver!! It discusses many types of curly hair from a little wave to course, kinky hair. Many home recipes to have the healthiest curly hair possible are included. Nothing has ever helped me take care of and be happy with my curly hair as this book!!

Quitting my hairstylist who rips through my hair with a paddle brush before coloring my hair and tends to cut too much off. Last time my scalp itched during the coloring process and my hair was so dry none of the multitudes of hair products I had could fix it.  I purchased a filter for my shower head and a deep conditioner which helped. But today after reading this book and all the lables on my hair products I decided to give it a try. I made my own lavender mist using fresh lavender from the garden using a distilling process to extract the oil mixed it with water and vegetable glycerin which I just happened to have and put it in a spray bottle to use as a curl refresher. The videos in the book are great...and my hair looks and feels amazing the cut even looks better..the info in this book was well worth the price of the book...I'm so inspired and will find a Deva curl specialist in my area for sure!

I'm 63 yo and have always had a little wave in the back of my hair, but about 5 years ago I started developing ringlets on  my nape hair.  Now I have full blown curly hair (ringlets everywhere) and I didn't  know what to do with it.  This book has really helped me get my hair under control, my curls are defined and look great and they look even better on day 2 :)  I've only been on the program for 2 weeks so I'm looking forward to seeing the progression.  I'm also excited I found a stylist that has taken Devacurl classes.

This review is about how this book has effected me and also about some of the products made by the same people/company. I think that there are plenty of specifics about what the book contains, so this is my personal response. If you have had curls all you life this might not apply to you, but if you find yourself suddenly curly compliments of chemo, read on.To start with, let me explain that I really always wanted curly hair, and never had it naturally. I was the perm queen in the 80's (yes I am dating myself).  When I was diagnosed with cancer I had hair that was past my bra strap, and cut with the Presage method (a cut that adds curl). Anyway, after Chemo and Radiation when my hair started coming back curly, I was thrilled. Finally I would have those long beautiful curly locks I had spent so much time and money pursuing.  But wait, where were the beautiful locks? First I looked like my grandma (short frizzy helmet of hair) and then instead of growing longer, my hair grew out.... Straight out.  I was thinking a job at the local circus would be my best option.  One day after crying for about an hour (literally) I decided to quit feeling sorry for myself and do something about it. So I went to Amazon, and lo and behold I found this book.When my hair started growing out, it was a train wreck. After applying the information from the book, about 70% of the time people now ask me who does my hair or what I do to it (seriously-not making this up). I went from frizz to beautiful fat curls. If you are dealing with Chemo Curl, I highly recommend this book and the related products. Although there is a specific chapter about Chemo Curl, don't just read it, read the whole book (the Chemo chapter was somewhat disappointing to me).Obviously I am not going to tell you everything that this book says. If you are dealing with the same things that I was, I would suggest that the first thing that you do (while you are waiting for this book to arrive) is go out and get a microfiber towel. Stop using your normal towel to dry your hair!! I went ahead and bought the Deva Curl No Poo Deva Curl No Poo 32oz,Zero Lather Conditioning Cleanser,  Deva Curl Low Poo DEVA by Deva Concepts CURL LOW POO ALL HAIR TYPES 32 OZ and Deva Curl conditioner Deva Curl Ultra Creamy  Daily Conditioner, One Condition, 32-Ounces. Although they all have pro's and cons, for a beginner like me they all were worth it. (I am going to try and do reviews on those when I get the time).To sum it up, after Chemo rather than buying a flat iron or a bunch of handkerchiefs, buy this book. It really helped me take a bad situation and turn it around. You don't realize how much you identify with your hair until you look in the mirror and hate what you see. Trust me, you have been thru enough already. Take those curls and own them. They are beautiful, maybe different, but definitely beautiful! By the way, Congratulation on getting those Chemo Curls, it means you are still here baby, still fighting!! You go with your beautiful self!!!

Love this book!  I have fought the curly-hair curse for years... the fluff, the frizz, the frowns in the morning.  But, this book has answers to many of those problems.  I've made some changes in my hair regime over the last week and now my hair is less frizzy (almost completely gone), way softer and less dry, and much more manageable.  The ""homemade recipes"" are easy to create and really do work!  The only thing that I wish was that this book named products to use, rather than just ingredients to avoid.  I have had to do some of my own research to find products and locate places to buy them.  However, I think that I have begun a new and happier chapter in my curly-haired life, thanks to the Curly Girl Handbook!!!

I've heard/read a lot about the Curly Girl Method through online blogs, YouTube, etc. My mom has naturally curly hair that she is still trying to learn how to tame and manage. She is also in her 60's so the online format and resources of blogs and YouTube aren't the most practical methods of learning for her. I was happy when I saw this came in book form. I purchased this Curly Girl Method book as a gift for my mom and her hair has never looked better!

Pretty good read.  I have ""slightly"" wavy hair and although switching to some of the recommended products may enhance that slight wavy, the tips on scrunching etc don't seem to work for me.  It is a lot of extra work to try to encourage my hair to curl.  I'll keep trying for a while.  I was already using sulfate free shampoos and conditioners so maybe my fine hair just won't take a curl very well.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I am a Devacurl convert as of about 4 months ago.  I have very delicate cherub curls, and my hair has been breaking off like it's going out of style for the past many years.  I have been brushing, combing, blow drying and flat ironing my hair to death.  By fighting my natural texture, I was killing my hair.  I decided to try something new, because I have spent thousands of dollars following my hair dresser's suggestions, and all of those suggestions have not helped me successfully grow my hair out.  I have very fine hair but lots of it, and it tends to break once it gets to my chin.  After doing EXTENSIVE research, including reading several clinical research papers, I concluded that sulfates were the reason for my hair breakage.  It isn't that sulfates are bad themselves, but its the fact that they strip my hair of the natural oils that protect each strand and keep them hydrated.  By stripping the hair of moisture, frying it and brushing it, my hair was brittle and totally destroyed by the time it reached my chin.  Washing hair with sulfates remove oil and more protein from the hair than using non-sulfate shampoos.  When I was doing all this on a daily basis, my hair was half broken off by the time it reached my shoulders.  This made growing my hair out nearly impossible.I started using the Devacurl Lowpoo/One condition, and after about a month, I moved on to use the Devaurl NoPoo and One Condition every other day.  I have completely stopped brushing my hair. I follow the curly girl method almost perfectly, and my hair has never looked better.  It's hydrated and it looks full and thick.  My hair is finally happy, and I now get compliments on it often.  My hair routine only takes 2 minutes, as apposed to 45 minutes that I used to spend killing my hair with various torture devices (blow dryer and flat iron).Here is my routine that I swear by:I get in the shower and wet my hair with warm water, apply nopoo to my fingertips and then massage it into my scalp for an entire minute.  I do not bring it through the ends of my hair.  I don't touch the ends of my hair when I am cleansing my scalp.  I then rinse my hair under the water of the shower for about 30 seconds.  Then I apply the One Condition from the roots to the tips of my hair, and I use a Mason Pearson wide tooth comb to distribute the conditioner and detangle my hair while in the shower.  I also use the comb to make a straight part in my hair (if I don't do this, my hair is kind of a mess at the top).  I wash out the conditioner and I gently cup my hair with a microfiber towel once I get out of the shower.  I use the microfiber towel to dry my hair with the gentle up motions; it's not really scrunching, it's more like scrunching with an open hand.  I then put a little bit of Devacurl Foam on the roots, and a tiny bit of Devacurl Angel on the tips.  I let my hair air dry and I don't touch it until it's totally dry.  The products help the hair stick together while it's drying, so it maintains the curl pattern without frizz.  When my hair is totally dry, I then gently shake the hair at the roots, and fluff up the ends by going around my head with open palmed ""scrunches.""  I never rake through my hair from roots to tips with my fingers when it's dry as this leads to a fluffy/frizzy mess.The Devacurl products also don't have silicones that aren't water soluble, so you don't have to use harsh cleansers to avoid product buildup.  This is a VERY important piece of information.  If you are going the no sulfate route, make sure that you are using products that have ingredients that are water soluble.  If not, you will have a massive buildup of products in your hair.  I was using a silicone mousse, and it made my hair look about three shades darker.  I thought the color change was because of my natural oils, but after I used a clarifying cleanser, the silicones washed out and my hair went back to it's normal texture and color.  Silicones are great for my hair, but I can't easily wash them out of my hair without using drying shampoos, so I now avoid them.It takes awhile for curly hair to get used to not being abused, so you should expect a period of chaos on your head for a bit, but once that period is over, you will be so happy you did this.  I am never going back to regular shampoos, and I don't plan to brush my hair ever again (even though I truly love my Mason Pearson brush, I will have to find another use for it).UPDATE: Since I started (several months ago) applying the curly girl method to my hair, I have not found ONE broken hair anywhere; yes, I actually check when I find them to see if the root is attached.  I used to find broken off ends everywhere but those days are over :)

This book was a revelation, and totally changed my outlook on myself. I always thought I had some weird ""cowlicks"" or light waves in my hair, and over the years I've used hundreds of dollars of perms, curling irons, gels, mousses, and blow dryers to ""style"" it and smooth it. As I got older my hair got more curly, and I hated the frizzy, undefined, shapeless mass on my head.My new stylist suggested I try the trial size of the Deva Curl products. They smelled great, and after using these a couple weeks, I went online to Amazon to buy larger sizes of the products and found this book.Now my hair is soft, shiny, bouncy and healthy. This book taught me how to shampoo, treat and cut my hair the ""curly girl way"". I took the book with me to my stylist to discuss all I learned. She understands this ""curly girl"" method so we are team, working together (she must have also read the book).  Now I have a combination of curls and waves and I am actually proud of my hair and feel more attractive than I have in years. It's easier to style my hair each day and I am no longer working against my hair's natural personality.I highly recommend this book and the Deva Curl products!

I had no clue how to maintain and style my curly hair. I have type 2a curly and it's always been so frizzy! I've been pulling it back for years now because I just didn't like the way it looked. After reading the book, I found out that I've been using the wrong type of shampoo/conditioner/styling products. I went and purchased sulfate/silicone/paraben free products and HOLY COW. I did not realize my hair could look like this. I even used her tips on cutting your own hair and I was surprised at how easy it was. No wonder I always cringe whenever I go to a salon to have my hair cut. They always cut my hair like straight hair and one time I ended up with a mullet that had me in tears. Now I can wear my hair curly and not be embarrassed about it. Yay! :)I gave the book 4 stars because of the ""Curl Confessions"". They eventually got boring to read and seemed like the same stories over and over. Other than that, the book has already helped me tremendously.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has been revised and updated with considerably more information and is a great read.  It's a lot of fun especially for those with curly hair with little/no idea how to take full advantage of that texture.The book begins with the Author's own bio and how she fought, then reconciled, then rejoiced in her own curls, starting the Devachon salon, which specializes in curly haired clients.  She then introduces the many different kinds of curls and how to determine which type of curl you have. While I found this interesting, I wasn't personally able to determine my own curl type, because some of the criteria overlap onto more than one curl type. However, the information is still helpful and entertaining.  Other chapters deal with hair styles for curly hair, general care and coloring of curly hair.  The updated book also includes a CD ROM disc which instructs how to cut one's own hair. These instructions are only applicable to someone with very long curly hair which can be pulled to the front of the face, those of us with shorter hair aren't able to see our hair to clip ends evenly. Frankly I would not recommend this to anyone since IMO success with curly hair is 95% all about the cut, which should be left to the care of a stylist experienced in cutting curly hair (and ladies, regardless of what they say, not all stylists can cut curly hair successfully )In summary, this is a fun and educational book which should leave curly girls far more knowledgeable about their curls, the care and holding their head up with pride.

This book helped me so much with my hair. If you have wavy, curly, frizzy or unruly hair get this book! My hair is thick and wavy, it’s always been a frizzy horrible mess that I flat ironed almost daily for 20 years. I’ve done the curly girl method for 2 months and my hair is transformed into healthy shiny extra wavy no frizzy hair. For the first time in my life I can honestly say I like my hair.

I think the information in this book is probably helpful to some, not so helpful for others. It may have to do with age, hair type, style of hairdo you like, etc.. I'm 61 with gray hair that's shoulder length, thick and curly..I can't really say which kind of curls I have, because reading through the description of the different kinds, I couldn't really find one that fit my hair..However,  I've been using sulfate free shampoos for years and have always used lots of conditioners (also sulfate free)... My hair has become more dry with age, especially since letting it go naturally gray.. I can only wash it now a couple of times a week or it is a dried out mess.. However, using the method described in this book (only shampooing your scalp then allowing the shampoo to run down the rest while rinsing) and then using a lot of conditioner that you rinse by gently throwing water at your head just didn't work well for me. The idea is to leave conditioner in to moisturize the hair.. It made my head itch!After cleansing, you are to gently squeeze out moisture with a tshirt or special towel, squeezing the curls upwards, never drying your hair like you normally do with a towel (trying to get as much water out as possible..big no no).. You are also not suppose to comb or bursh your hair.. After using the tshirt or special towel to squeeze out water, you use a handful of gel (with no alchohal and a list of other chemicals.. Very hard to find by the way..), you apply it to hair and then squeeze the hair upwards, to lock in the curls.. You then use clips to lift parts of your hair on the top of your head if need be and leave it alone to dry.. You can use a defuser on the ends, but it's not really recommended, but rather, turn up the heater in your car on the way to work.Okay, at 61, I don't want those tight, crispy curls created by this method.. I also have hot flashes and would not enjoy turning up the heater in my car to dry my curls (lol)... I did try this method and found that even using a defuser to remove a little of the moisture, after washing my hair in the morning, it was still damp at the roots when I went to bed that evening...I keep my hair longer because I pull it up in a curly ponytail or messy bun 99% of the time.. I dry my bangs with a round brush and my hair dryer, but using this method, one is to let the bangs dry naturally.. Not a good look for me... My bangs do curl on humid days and I like them that way, but just allowing them to dry curly after shampooing/conditioning, well, they look goofy..If I had known about this method when I was a young woman, I may have liked it, although, I've never been one to like that crispy curl look. I like my hair to be soft.. Using this method, you aren't suppose to touch your curls, just leave them alone.. If need be, you can gently use your fingers to seperate the curls, whatever... I did try this method twice, so for one week I had these crispy like curls.. I found it very difficult to deal with them on a daily basis.. My curly pony tail is full of bouncy curls, but using this method, they were just really flat, crispy curls.. I like my bouncy curls better..Like I said, it probably has a lot to do with age.. The book is interesting, but honestly, I think I just found out I know more about my curls than I thought I did... I've been taking care of them pretty darn good all of my life.. I tried a chemical straightner once in my life, realized how damaging it was and didn't do that again. I've blown dried my hair straight on occassions (in the winter) and used a flat iron to straighten it, and enjoyed that look occassionally, and honestly, can't see where it's harmed my hair at all (maybe if I did this daily it would, but I never have)... To be honest, it's a lot easier to just let my hair do what it wants to do, which is curl, so for the most part, I really do enjoy having hair that I can wash, dry my bangs and just let the rest of it dry curly without having to mess with it... Like so many others, I wanted straight hair when I was young. I used to save orange juice cans to roll my hair with.. I actually slept with a headfull of juice cans in order to have straight hair.. Now my sisters, who have straight hair, tell me I'm the lucky one...their hair just gets limp and looses it's shape when it's humid.. Mine just gets curlier. I've learned to love my curls, but I didn't need this book to get there..

I really like this book. I got some very good advice, some I'm sure I could've found on the internet, but I like to re-read books. I had always rinsed my conditioner because I thought it would weigh my hair down if I left it in. Now, I just splash water on the top of my head, and squeeze the excess out with a t-shirt, add a leave in and a serum, and plop.  After reading the book, I have switched to a no sulfate shampoo and a no ""cones"" conditioner. I am seeing a difference in my hair and liking it. I have followed a lot of the advice for my curly/wavy hair which has always had a mind of its own, lol. As I've gotten older, I have just learned to enjoy my hair and let it be itself. My hair is not as dry and frizzy, I wish it was even less frizzy, but I am confident that the more I keep treating my hair like this, the better it will be. Very enjoyable book.

I have owned the orginal ""Curly Girl"" handbook for nine years, but it has come apart at the seams, so I bought this updated version. This is a much-improved 'part 2' to the original book. Here, we get more advice and improved methods of taking care of curls and waves. It includes updates with a few of the women from the original book as well as the stories of new women and even a couple of men. There's are also new chapters about the dangers of thermal reconditioning and women who came out of chemotherapy with curly hair growing in. It even includes a DVD that demonstrates how to take care of curls. My one minor complaint about this book is that while there are more options as to what kind of curls exist, I still do not fall into any one catagory. I would say that I am a Corkscrew curly, but my hair doesn't have its 'symptoms' (I can't use things like hot oil or cream gel because it sits on my hair and makes it stringy). Then there's the new Corkicelli curl, whose symptoms I seem to have, but my hair doesn't look anything like. I just follow the procedure for Botticelli hair, even though it is probably not my hair type. Also, I have to admit that I am intimidated by the idea of having to cut my own hair because of the ignorance of most salons; every salon I've ever gone to brushes my hair, shampoos it and cuts it wet (the wrong way). Still, I know that the authors are right because of how great my hair looks now that I know what to do with it. I gave the original book four stars; I'll give this one a perfect five.

The book was filled with a lot of information of which I was not aware.  However, this is a real commitment for a lifetime if you choose to keep your curls.  Also the products are expensive.  I would like to have seen some diy recipes for products or organic choices.  I have thin hair and would like to see a chapter on how to make my hair look thicker and still be healthy.

Or your child’s. I got this for my niece and her mom, as my side of the family is biracial and my sister-in-law is caucasion. My curl is different from niece, but no less a nightmare to maintain. This book goes through the various “types” of curls, how to wash and maintain, how to detangle, how to cut and style - just everything. Also, a lot of useful information about product ingredients that can help or harm curls. My hairdresser recommended this book to me 15 years ago, and after finally buying it now, I really wish I had listened sooner.

She has and knows how to work with curly hair.  My hair is thick and coarse with S curls and now has no little to no frizz.  AND...I found a stylist, as she recommends to do,  that knows how to cut curly hair...what a difference!  I now love my curly hair!!! Oh...and I am not using a comb.  Just took a little convincing.  :)  Her products are amazing.  That is all my new stylist uses which is also a plus.  She gave me a few pointers on the no comb thing.  I am so delighted and get compliments on my hair daily.  I even quit coloring it.  Absolutely amazed at the difference.  I share the book with all my curly haired friends.Previous review.....I like her book but, I don't think I can go without using a comb.  I tried it a first but my hair is very thick, wavy, s'wavy and it gets tangled throughout a day.  I am still working with her products.  This regimen requires a new paradigm shift for me.  I will update in a few months as it is a work in progess.

I have always had hair that tended to get REALLY BIG.  It would start out fine after I got out of the shower and as the day progressed- my hair got more and more volume.  Blow-drying would give me hair that the big hair bands would have killed for.  My hair seriously missed its decade.  When I saw this book- I thought I would give it a try.  I was hopeful, but skeptical that it could do something to help me.  I still haven't figured out just which kind of curl my hair is- so I'm playing around with different ways of washing it.  But the difference has been HUGE.  My hair is much curlier than I every thought.  And it's not trying to soak up every bit of humidity in the air.  I can definitely go out and not worry that my hair is going to go wild on me.  My husband loves that I'm now wearing my hair down instead of always clipped up.  Was this a life changing book for me?  Probably not- but I am much happier with my hair now.  I highly encourage you to try it out!

I starting reading this book about a week ago and now I'm in love with my curls.  I've never been one to straighten my hair or battle against my curls. But I still suffered with dry frizzy hair. Most days I would wear my hair tied back, if I did wear it down it would look nice for an hour or 2 and then frizz.My whole family have curly hair and I 'thought' I understood it. I just didn't feel I had the time or money to look after it right - I was wrong!!It's super easy to do. You can use cheap grocery store brands (I use Tresemme Naturals Conditioner) - just remember to read the ingredients!  It takes me about 5 mins to wash/style my shoulder length hair now. And my hair has never looked better - and it's only been a week!This book also has a section on kids hair. I now know how to look after my daughter's curly hair, so no more tears and tantrums in the mornings! Bliss!I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone with curly or wavy hair.

I was hoping for more instruction. I had already figured out you can’t brush curly hair. But only getting out knots when you condition, what about when you shampoo?! Would be good for those that feel alone as it has a lot of personal sad stories (they didn’t make me feel better or help me have nicer curls).

Yes love, love,... its my go to book. when i'm stuck... and don't know what to do with my hairit gives me encouragement that you can do things to help your beast on top of your head hahalove the homemade recipes in the back.. wish it had a lot more.. and love the hair styles in the back also wish it had more.On the other side, I wish it had more to talk about Botticelli type curls, and it had more talk about ingredients that are both good and bad to use..wish I knew what to do if you wanted to blend their deva curl products with other ones because the deva curl don't always work with other products I'd assume and to use all deva curl products together is just too expensive for me.

A must have book to tell you how to handle your curls, if you have curly hair.  My daughter has a combination of Chinese & Black hair, which it's not nappy or kinky, but it is very curly.  I happen to have wavy Chinese hair, instead of straight.  She has several different curl types and sometimes her hair is a challenge to manage, but this book shows her how to do it.  Plus, I take her to a salon once every 6 months and that combined with this book, which that salon does stuff that this book talks about, is great for my daughter.  Wish I had known about doing this when she was younger.  It would have saved me a lot of pain and heartache, and frustration.

As a Curly Girl myself I wanted to read this to see what all the fuss is about.  This book is full of information in an informal chatty format.  It validated a lot of what I was already doing with my hair and I've incorporated many of the suggestions from the book.  My wavy/curly hair is now healthier looking, softer, and frizz-free.  I'm glad I read it.

I do the curly girl method already and my friend seemed interested in it so I got her the book on how to care  for Hair! It’s an awesome guide to caring for all types of hair and different recipes and things to avoid.

I bought this looking for the Holy Grail in hair care. Pretty darn close. The author has seriously curly hair and chronicles her own struggles to make peace with her hair. I implemented a number of the recommendations - use the hair clips while drying my hair every day, sought out her hair products Deva Curl shampoo, conditioner, texture wave and gel which all work as described. My hair is not quite as curly as the model on the cover, more like wavy or curly depending on the cut. Also had my hairdresser cut my hair differently taking advantage of my natural curl. All in all, one of the best hair care books I've found!

This straight to the point (the only straight thing about this) handbook for curly girls is a must for Any person with Any curl.  As a hairdresser and resident curly girl; I am grateful for the hardwork and trials that I know went into the journey(s) that conceived this manual. Full of testimonials structural knowledge of the curls themselves, chemical insights of products, Q&A's. This book covers everything curly except 'why is there no curly haired emoji? '  I'm excited about my new arsenal of curl knowledge and am now eager for more personal experience!

I too have fought my hair my whole life. I do not recall ever loving my hair. The one thing that has made a difference is know the Porosity (you can google this and how to test your hair for you Porosity) of my hair. Not one beautician has ever mentioned this. When I have mentioned this to different beauticians, some of them do not know what I am talking about. I have low Porosity and consider myself a 2C so to get a deep condition, I use natural conditioner and put on a shower cap over and set under a hard bonnett hair dryer for 30 minutes.The heat opens up my hair to asorb the conditioner. I have used a diffuser, air dried and used a hard bonnett hair dryer to dry my hair. During the week I air dry. I do sit under a hard hair bonnett dryer for the weekend. I use low heat and my hair is awesome! I use the Deva Clips under the dryer and it is an ionic dryer and my body is unbelievable!  It is really important as the CG book implies to stay away from all silicones, drying  Alcohols  and sulfates. Silicones are the worst for my hair type. Most Curly Products that are purchased have some sort of Silicones in them!  I have used the Deva Products and really do love them but I love looking for new products also that will meet the criteria of the CG Method. Once you are aware of what NOT to use, there are quite a bit of products available. I am still using trial and error and really enjoying trying this method. I will never go back to straightening or curling  my hair w/ a curling iron. I too get compliments daily on my hair. I think reading this book is a major step in knowing how to work with your curls. LOVE IT!!!

I got this book because I am transitioning to natural and I would hear mention of this book almost everywhere online. I eventually caved in after searching everything I could online via youtube/google thinking there may be another tidbit of information that I can utilize that I haven't found yet. Unfortunately for me I could of stuck with the information I gathered through other sources without reading this book and been just fine. However if you don't want to go through the hassle of filtering though vlogs, blogs, and would prefer to read the ""Curly Girl"" method from the source with multiple ""woe is me until I found the 'Curly Girl' Method "" tales scattered throughout the handbook than go for it.

This book is definitely a good place to start when you want to change your hair game from dry and frizzy to defined waves/curls. I’ve learned to tweak things to fit my hair and scalp (at least for now) that are different to the book, but I’m noticing substantially less frizz and way more bounce to my waves!I ended up purchasing both the kindle edition and then a hard copy as the videos wouldn’t play and the layout got a bit weird on the kindle edition.

I adore The Curly Girl Handbook. About 10 years ago, I read Curly Like Me and really learned a lot about curls, but there were product suggestions and techniques that did work for me. I had been seeing the “CG Method” on YouTube videos and loved the tips so I decided to make the plunge. I was pleasantly pleased it was attached to Deva. I love Deva products and the DevaCut saved my hair. However, this book DOES NOT push Deva and that is soooo refreshing. I really loved the trimming section. My hair is getting healthier and longer everyday!

I thought it was a little silly to buy a whole book jus ton hair care but this book has changed the way i do my hair. Great suggestions that actually work. My hair is way curlier and way less frizzy. hoping I can actually grow it long and have it keep it's curl with these new tips!

My little one's hair grew into beautiful blonde curls, had figured out a few things by trial and error but thankfully a neighbor told me about this book. What a great resource.

"

I bought this book after doing lots of research on curly hair and trying to figure out what i could do with it, because i was so tired of straightning and damaging my hair. I had already used Deva Curl products before and liked them a lot. I learned a lot from this book and found out what porducts were good and what products were bad for curly hair. I would reccomend this book to anybody with curly hair trying to revive and learn how to properly take care of them.

Before I bought this book I was at the point of being so frustrated with my hair that I put it up in a bun every single day. It was so frizzy and awful. You couldn't tell that I even had curly hair, it just looked like a giant frizzy mess. After reading this book and buying the no poo shampoo, I have seen amazing results. It does take a little bit longer for my hair to get dry, but the results are well worth it. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair recently. People keep asking me if I used a curling iron in my hair! Most of my family and friends didn't even know I had curly hair since the only time they have seen me with my hair down is after flat ironing it. I am so happy I found this book.The only two negative things I have to say about this is that in the wind, my hair still will get a bit frizzy (still nothing compared to what it used to be though). I am also disappointed in the fact that the hair  products created by this author are pretty pricey. (Almost $60 for shampoo and conditioner combo 32oz!) She doesn't pressure you to use her product in the book which is nice, but it seems like there should be a more affordable option, or she should price her product somewhere the ordinary person wouldn't cringe at the price. I have found some recipes for no poo shampoo online that I will be trying once my bottle of deva curl shampoo runs out. Hopefully there is an inexpensive and still effective home recipe for this.But, in summary, if you have curly or frizzy hair you should read this book. You won't regret it!!

I have naturally curly hair and have searched for many years for the right products; some were made my hair stiff, some dryed it out, some didn't help with frizz, some made my hair flakey, some itchy...... this product is great! After carefully researching I found it reassuring to know that the lady, Lorraine Massey, who invented this line of products ACTUALLY HAS NATURALLY CURLY HAIR HERSELF!!! I purchased the deva curl gel, deva curl no poo, deva curl conditioner, and curly girl book - my experience with all of them together is fantastic! I am not kidding...ONE wash and gel using the method detailed for my hair in the book and it was a night and day difference!!! ONE wash and people I see every day were commenting on how great my hair looked literally overnight!! I only wish I could get to the Devachan salon to have a cut done by someone who actually knows how to cut curly hair!!Hats off to the Deva Girls from all of us curly girls!!! :)

It has a lot of helpful hints, suggestions and home made product recipes and I believe it is a good method and a good start to living with curly/ wavy hair. But every person’s hair is different and I have found that one product or one method isn’t the complete answer.  I would recommend the electronic version for a good place to start if your going back to your wonderful curls.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I love the book and the information. However I was extremely disappointed that the only how to video in the section for ""ethnic curls"" was done by a person that did not have typical Afro textured hair.  The book goes into detail about discrimination against curly haired people but purposely made a decision to exclude dense Afro textured hair.  The visual would have been very helpful for all of us fractal/zig zag curly girls.  For that it lost two stars. I still recommend the book. It will revolutionize your curls.  Update, the maximum hydration method is a modified curly girl routine for type 4 hair.  It has given me the curl definition and the wearable wash and go that I originally thought the curly girl method by itself would give me.

I’ve found more information online than in this book. This is mostly people’s personal stories of why they embraced their curly hair. There’s a small section for each hair type. Wish I could return.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has some good pointers, but is overly enthusiastic and rigid. The ""no poo"" method only works for some people, and it seems there is only one hairstyle featured. There is a tiny chapter for men, and she says she thinks men would probably want to spend less time on their hair than women, and was rather thin on details for shirt hair cuts. I am not a man, but I want a short haircut, and don't want to spend hours and hours on my hair. I gave this three stars because there is useful information in there, but I am definitely not a curly girl convert.

I have been pleasantly surprised by this book. I thought about buying it last year, but decided to put it off. Lucky for me, they came out with the updated version during that time and I bought, for about $8, the book and a DVD that came with it! I find it wonderful, that for such a small investment you receive so many great recipes (I've already tried 4 of them and have loved them all) and incomparable advice.I was born with straight hair, but when I hit adolescence, it turned wavy/curly. My hair type is some kind of mixture of both wavy (to about my ears) and botticelli curls according to the book, with a few other curl types thrown in, which is not at all uncommon (made me feel less weird to learn this).The book encourages you to embrace your natural hair type and shows you how to identify what types of curls you have and how to care for them in a way that won't drive you nuts. I don't feel like I've had a bad hair day since I first followed the advice for my closest hair type (wavy). I make my own flax seed hair gel for dirt cheap and use an inexpensive, cone-free conditioner for my routine.Ever since adolescence hit I've hated my hair, and on very few days have I actually felt happy with how it looked when I didn't do anything to it (and I like my hair low-maintenance, which meant I was unhappy with it but stuck most of the time). Since I have waist-length hair I gave up straightening a long time ago because the results never lasted long and took me 45 minutes or longer to do it.Only because of this book have I really started enjoying my hair. I have to admit - the scariest thing for me was ""getting rid of"" (I gave them to my husband to use!) my natural bristle hair brushes and combs and just using my fingers and oil to moisturize the length of my hair. But the improvements have been amazing and it is so nice not to need brushes anymore, believe it or not! My husband loves my newly more-pronounced, healthy-looking curls!My advice: buy the book! I'd be really surprised if you regretted it. The recipes are inexpensive and easy to try (my favorites are the exfoliating cleanser, lavender spray, and lemon aid) and the method only takes a couple of days to get the hang of (especially if you watch the DVD method a couple of times and then compare it with your hair type in the book)! For the first time my hair is so easy to do and I don't have to worry about it! This is a truly empowering book.

Gave me some great tips on how to care for my only curly head child. I haven't been able to too many changes, but with the ones that I have, her curls are finally staying curly instead of fizzing out. I do wish there were better pictures for the different types of curls esp since each description sounds a bit like her hair

I never knew ""Swavy"" was a thing.  My daughters have gorgeous curls and I've always thought my hair was too straight on top, but curly on the sides and back.

I didn't hear about Deva Curl until sometime after my BC in February 2010. I didn't understand, until I read Lorraine Massey's CG Handbook, how important she and Teri LaFlesh are to unlocking the mysteries of multi-cultural curly hair. Their books compliment each other. I read Lorraine's book and watched the DVD the same day it was delivered. I also read it again that Saturday and that Sunday. I felt there was important information for multi-cultural curlies that was missing. The before pics of two of the multi-cultural models on the DVD flashed by so quickly, I had to replay that section several times to get an idea of how their hair looked prior to the process. I get that there are only so many pages to a book and Lorraine was graciously inclusive. I particularly like that her products and techniques like Teri's are inclusive. I also read Teri's book as soon as I purchased it. I incorporate information and techniques from both ladies into my hair routines. I try to keep it as simple as possible. It's going to take another year or so for my hair to grow long enough to take advantage of the DevaChan salon experience. I can't wait. I'll update my review when I do so.

I absolutely love this book.  My hairdresser is a Deva Care specialist and has this book at her salon.  She took one of the models and colored my hair after it, I got so many compliments.  This is a simple, non technical step by step on what to do with your curly hair!  My hair has always been crazy since I was a kid, my husband calls me Bob Marley, but he LOVES my curly hair.  This book has made ME love my curly hair.  Because you probably know how it is, that everyone says how they love your curly hair but you don't love it?  This book teaches you how to LOVE your curly hair.

It may sound a little overly dramatic, but this book changed my life (I first discovered it under the first edition)!  Before I found this book, I battled with super frizz and super unruly/unpredictable hair that my straight-haired mother and sister had no clue what to do with.  After reading this book, I learned how to take care of my ""Botticelli"" curls and now have minimum frizz and tons of compliments!  It makes sense that someone with curly hair have a completely different hair routine than someone with straight hair.  I got a few jeers and sideways glances when people found out I didn't use shampoo after reading this book; however, the results spoke for themselves as my hair transformed into its natural splendor.  And I never once had someone complain that my hair smelled bad because I used conditioner in the place of shampoo...quiet the opposite, actually!  I had a guy in high school who told me he loved sitting behind me because my hair always smelled so nice.  A little creepy, but it just proves the point that you won't be ""gross,"" ""nasty,"" or ""smelly"" if you ditch the harsh sulfate-salt-laden common shampoos for this ""Curly Girl Method"" of cultivating your curls!

For one of my 2019 resolutions, I wanted to figure out what to do about my frizzy, dry hair. I was so sick of it and tired of not knowing what to do about it. (I’ve battled it for nearly 40 years now!!) So I ordered  This book, read it in two days front to back and then started following the directions for my Botticelli curls. It has revolutionized the way I style and care for my hair. It has taken My usually dry, frizzy hair—especially in the winter— from utterly unmanageable and always-up-in-a-bun-or-ponytail to wow, I can actually wear it down now. If you have curly hair that has stumped you all your life, buy this book. It’s the best book for curly girls ever!

This is an excellent book for beginners. My hair started getting curly after menopause.  I didn't realize how curly it was until I grew it out after years of short hair, that I dried naturally, with a little mousse and scrunching.  This book has helped me learn how to care for my longer hair without using a lot of heat.

This book is written well, easy to read with good information and  nice pictures. It helped my hair go from frizzy to curly and I am very thankful for the help!  (Although it is nothing to do with the book I must add I do not care for any of the devacurl hair products).

I really enjoyed this book. Although there were some sections that didn't really apply to me, they were still interesting to read since they could be applicable later in life. The tips and methods that were given in this book has been changing the way my hair looks for the better. Image problems because of crazy hair that I have struggled with for a long time have finally been solved with the help of this book! I will be carrying these practices with me for the rest of my life.

The book is fabulous... don't buy the e-book expecting the video and multimedia content to work.. I've tried it on many devices, and none of them work.  Additionally, most of the photos are very small no matter what device I view them on... but the advice in the book is good all the same.Having a daughter whose hair type is exactly like mine was when I was her age, I feel that there's a good chance that her hair will eventually turn into beautiful waves like mine did... Although I love my wavy hair, I have no idea how to take care of it and mostly wear it straight.  Until recently, hair with any type of bend or curl to it was out of style and seen as unruly and unprofessional, but it's time for me to figure out how to take care of my own hair and embrace it so I can help her fall in love with hers.  I found this method on a few forums and all of them urged you to read the book to find out for yourself.  I'm calling this a jumping-off point because curls have a mind of their own and you need to figure out what works for yours in order to make it look and feel its best.  Many girls start here and find other things to add to it to make them feel their best.

I love this book.  It is well written.  The only thing is that mine did not come with the DVD.  But that's OK.  I learned how to do the Curly Girl method on YouTube!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book is life changing! For the first time in my 60 years I can see the true beauty of naturally curly hair, something I've shamefully hidden with short haircuts and blow dryers. This book covers the politics, science, & psychology of having curly hair. It will show you how to appreciate, grow, & maintain healthy & beautiful curly hair. It is packed with the most unexpected and surprising information about the destructive nature of commercial shampoos and other damaging ""beauty"" product ingredients. You will be amazed!The plethora of pictures, illustrations, personal stories, and recipes for making your own maintenance products are very helpful. I am letting my hair grow out for the first time in 52 years! To hell with shame, hiding, and narrow minded beauty standards! This book is a heartfelt gift to all of us who grew up fighting and struggling against the gift bestowed us. It is strangely exhilarating to anticipate ""coming out curly"" for all the world to see! Can't wait 'til my hair gets longer!Gotta go - am ordering this book for several curly friends! Already spreading the word! This book is worth it's weight in gold! Many thanks & blessings to the authors! Viva la curly girls!

The book gives the reader practical advice regarding how to manipulate your curlies.  The only problem I have with it is the ""trickle"" form of rinsing.  (Not sure it's actually called that, but if you read it you will see what I mean.) Rinsing your hair with splashes of water is just not efficient, and one ends up with more conditioner left than one would really want.  However, everything else in this book will help curly girls, including Bender's own way of typing your hair.  No ""3A"" or ""3B"" here. The book includes a short DVD in which the basic method is demonstrated and explained.  Don't think that the DVD is all you need.  The book itself is energetic and practical, and it got this curly girl to try new things.  I must admit that in conjunction with the book, I had my first Deva cut (fantastic), and I am now using Deva products, which are great.

I am so pleased that I bought this book as recommended to me from a friend. when I received it I read through it immediately to begin ""living"" as a curly girl! There is so much information provided within these pages to get you started along with a very useful section on FAQ's and an excellent DVD is also included. To start, you have to find out which type of curly girl you are and you are set from there. I love that the author offers homemade hair recipes and even those too turned out to work great on my hair. Mind you, you have to be patient if you really want to yield those curly results as your hair has been used to be brushed, colored, and most likely overly processed. I have to also say, that when I read the section on tossing out my combs and brushes that I was more than a bit apprehensive to doing so, however, I did not hesitate and threw them out same day and have not regretted it at all! My hair is stronger and more healthy then it's ever been! I highly recommend this book to anyone!

My hair spirit animal. I have been fighting with my curly hair for as long as I can remember. I tried all different haircuts, tried straightening it, I even cut it all off at one point. I got a really good haircut awhile back and he recommended this book and for less than $10 why not. I have learned so much. I cut my own hair now! It always really soft, the curls are super defined and last for days as long as I put it up at night and revive them in the morning. I always seem to find new info when I open this book. I recommend it to every curly girl I meet who's hair needs a little love. I even told a lady who had adopted a little black girl about this book and she was SO relieved cause she had no idea what to do with ethnic hair, but there's a whole section in here about it!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Had heard about this book for several years but never got around to purchasing it.  Then a few weekends ago I saw a friend with curly hair that I had not seen in about a year.  Her hair looked wonderful.  Big healthy curls, no frizz, no halo!  Nothing but healthy curls.  Of course I immediately asked her what products she was using and she told me it wasn't the products but she was following this method.  Came home and ordered the book.  Turns out I was doing a lot of it correctly but just not completely correctly.  I had all the correct shampoo and I was shampooing only my scalp but not correctly so making my long ends really tangle.  Also even though I thought I was using enough conditioner my hair was dying of thirst and needed a lot more.Bottom line, today is my 2nd hair day and my hair looks wonderful.  Soft long curls, no frizz, no halo and looks healthy for the first time in years.  And that is only with one time going by her method.  I have finally found the Holy Grail for my very long curly hair!

I'm a convert! Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey has saved my ""Hair Life!!""  I'm on day 5 of following the Curly Girl method and am so pleased, I gave away my hair dryer and beloved Chi flat iron in addition to tossing out my hairbrush and shampoo!  I have NEVER in my life had such tame, frizz-free, GORGEOUS hair and curls! In fact, this morning at work, an African-American woman asked me how I have achieved such beautiful hair. I told her all about Curly Girl (which is for ALL ethnicities) and the method which is so ridiculously simple.I wish I had known about this years ago, but over the last 30 years, the only information out there for curly hair care was how to FIGHT the curl - how to straighten, relax, blow dry or get the Keratin treatments or Brazillian blow out.  FINALLY, there is someone to teach us all how to care for and love our curls and what NOT to put in our hair.

I ordered this as a Kindle book because I was/am just that desperate for help with my new (started growing in curly early 2015) curly hair. The book did offer good insight and didn't push DevaCurl products at all which I appreciated. There was a decent amount of information in the book that is contrary to what my stylist told me during my DevaCut service which I found confusing to say the least. There are many tips on how to not spend a fortune on your hair which is easy to do. One downfall is that with the Kindle version, you do not have the DVD and therefore none of the short videos that work in tandem with the book. The plus is that you can check out the DevaCurl channel on YouTube and get more specific information for you and your hair. The book is short, easy to read in a day. I would say that most of the book is probably going to be most helpful for women without the kinky coily, African American types of hair. While there is a chapter dedicated to these hair types, it is just one chapter and I think you'd be better off on NaturallyCurly.com and searching reviews and routines on YouTube as there are a million for African American hair and far fewer for white women. It's not expensive and some of the tips, like how to trim your own hair could save you a ton of money in the long run.Oh...there are several small stories, rather journies of curly girls and their experiences from hating their hair to embracing it.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have to say that living with curly hair does nothing to help you tame it. Most things in life simply require trial and error, but our hair is just something tricky. I am very happy that a book like this exists. I have taken a lot of the information and made changes that have encouraged my hair to heal, grow, and spring back to life.The solutions you'll read about in Curly Girl are effective, but also affordable! You don't have to run out and buy $20 shampoos or $100 hair appliances. What worked for me was drying my hair with an old t-shirt and co-washing, which is washing with just conditioner.To all the other curly girls out there - this one is definitely for you!

The Bible may speak to spiritual matters, but the Curly Girl is the Bible for Curly matters!  Lol!  As a curly girl, I was beside myself trying to hide one of my greatest glories under hats, braids, twists, gobs of hair products, anything to tame it into submission.  In grade school, I was called Poodle, Brillo Pad, and Bushman.  When I finally read this book, I cut my hair into a short flirty a-line, owned my curliness, and all my confidence flooded back with it!  Now I love buying this book for other girls who are the ones hiding from their own glorious locks instead of embracing them.  My favorite people to send this book to are mothers who find themselves by adoption, marriage, or whatever, completely overwhelmed by a new curly girl in the family.  My mother certainly had no idea what to do with me, and we are genetically similar in every other way.  Imagine suddenly having to help a girl that in no way resembles you!  This has become a Godsend to a lot of beautiful women.  Rock the Curls, Ladies!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
It was good information that was useful but once you read it once there’s not any real reason to revisit the info. I would have liked some more specific recommendations as far as product. Probably a book I’d just check out at the library if I had to do it over again.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Turns out I've been caring for my hair all wrong! I loved this book not only for the hair care and styling education SPECIFIC to curlies, but also for the stories. I can relate to so many of them. This book helped me really like my curls (maybe for the first time in my life) because now I have a better understanding of how to work WITH them instead of constantly fighting against them. It's not just a matter of letting your curls go the way they want to go, but promoting curl with the right styling techniques and products. My hair has more bounce and less frizz than I can remember ever having before.While Lorraine does mention her haircare product line, it's not pushy at all. Rather, she also talks about homemade cleansers and teaches how to read labels so you can make better decisions on what products to buy for better results. I will add however, that I do highly recommend her DevaCurl conditioner. It's lightweight, smells nice, makes detangling a snap and is seriously the best conditioner I've ever used. I also tried a couple of the homemade deep conditioning treatments... but these I found only marginally helpful in restoring moisture to my hair. Mainly the treatments were time consuming and just made my hair feel weighted down and rather dull.Overall though, the usefulness of this book (for frustrated curly girls and guys) cannot be overstated. After replacing all the haircare products in our house with a brand that uses more natural ingredients, and none of the ""ingredients to avoid"", even my teenage son (who has shaggy, longish hair and wild curls) has seen an improvement in how much more manageable his hair is.An easy read and worth every penny. I wish it had been around 25 years ago.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This is a must read for every girl with curls who has ever been dismayed by frizz, longed for straight hair or felt she was losing a battle against her curls.  At last I have the hair I have always wanted!  I was an immediate convert when I read the book and saw results with my hair even before I switched my products to sulfate free - just by changing my techniques.  I can't say how long it will take to see results on damaged hair.  My hair was already fairly healthy as I rarely blow dried it anyway and was shampooing only weekly.  But even healthy, I hated it.  Frizz was my every day nemesis.  Winter dry frizz, summer humid frizz, windy frizz, etc.  Can't say I never have frizz now, but I absolultely have gorgeous curls that make me smile every time I see them.  Thanks Lorraine!!! and thanks to Chuck, my amazing hair guy who pointed me in the right direction!!!

Love this book! Great practical tips on taking care of different types of curls. Also information on why we should embrace how our hair was made to be. Recommend  for anyone with slightly wavy to super curly hair. The methods have already transformed my hair in a week.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book changed the way I feel about my hair and my image.Like many of the other commenters here I too did a purge shortly after reading through this book the first time; I threw out all of my drug store 'curly' products that were in fact high in sulphates. I looked up a curly girl salon and tried my hand at mixing my own moisturizers. Within just a week I was seeing more shine and bounce to my hair, and yes others noticed and remarked on it too! Six + months in I'm much happier with my curls and much more at peace with their moods.I wish there were more on styling for everyday - not just up-dos - or on the right kind of salon cut for your curl. I get that we should try trimming our own locks but let's talk more about language to use when getting a full on cut!I'm ready for book 3!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
If you are new to curly girl buy this edition; but, as a long time follower there wasn't enough of an update for me. I had mostly bought this edition for the hair cutting section. I was disappointed as it just highlights a trim not detailing a haircut. If I could find a professional that didn't do a hack job or cost as much as my food bill (most tend to cost a ton and are bad) then I would be okay. Even though Massey empathizes and verbalizes her many bad hair cutting experiences she still says to go only to professionals for a true cut. I know she sells a program to teach hairdressers her technique. Maybe a way to help business by not sharing in a book? I have been to one of her stylist on a vacation (AMAZING) but sadly there are none reasonably priced and worthwhile in my city.

LOVE this book that started me on embracing my curls & loving myself. It goes hand in hand with self awareness and self love and acceptance. LOVE Lorraine!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This was an easy and informative read.  I learned a lot about how to take better care of my curls and avoid the frizzy look that often accompanies curly hair.  I love how the author breaks down every type of curl there is and the characteristics and behaviors of each.I had my hair cut locally in San Diego by a certified ""Deva Curl"" stylist - it was a pricey adventure, but it was fun to pamper myself for a day and see how thorough this dry haircut technique is that is recommended for curly hair types rather than the traditional wet haircut.  I also purchase the Deva Curl hair products on Amazon now that I've learned what a difference they make in bringing my curls to life.This book also has a lot of great tips and home remedies if you can't afford the Deva Curl products and nowadays a lot of beauty supply companies are making products without the laurel sulfate ingredients that dry out curls.  I like the before/after pictures and stories of each person's nightmare hair stories from childhood - it's easy to relate to the bad hair day experiences I went through as a kid and young adult.

The handbook was useful in giving some constructive ways to properly take care of you hair. In addition to that I felt all the personal stories helped me to accept and really love my hair. It was nice to learn that I wasn’t alone in feeling so conflicted about my hair. Now I go out of my way to tell other curly haired girls how beautiful their hair is.

I was watching youtube video's about hair and hearing them refrence the ""Curly Girl Method"" intrigued me. So I looked it up and found out about the book that started the haircare trend. Definitly a good book to keep around. Tried the method for the first time and I love the results. If your intrested in another way of careing for your hair I recommend this book.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Definitely good for a launch into the curly world and how to use products. I’m not expecting miracles and I know there’s a tortuous road ahead but I feel like I have a better insight. I think that’s all I can ask for. The rest is up to me.

I debated purchasing this book because if all the information in line. I'm really glad I purchased this as all the information is in one location bwith many pictures. I wish it had a section on porosity, it's relevance & how to determine porosity. Very pleased!

This book has opened up a whole new world to me! I discovered that I have ""S"" / wavy curls and that my daughter has cherub curls and I learned how to care for them! I will say that I have not successfully switched to the curly girl ""no-poo"" method though. But I have cut out sulfates ect ect like this book recommends! Tuns of tips and tricks in this book still waiting for me to try and enhance my curl game!

I am growing my hair back in after going through chemo.  I have curls like I did when I was young, before I started coloring my hair and it straightened and thinned.As I am discovering how to care for the curls I bought this book to see if it would help me.I am happy to say that it has many tips and tricks for the newly curly.  I guess if you have had curly hair for a while then  you know that you should not use a towel on your hair as it pulls and ruffled the cuticles.  I did not know I should treat my hair like fragile lace or cashmere.I really liked this book and it is much cheaper than all the wrong products I have tried, mainly the ones with silicones. Who knew?  I have very fine curly wavy hair, it is now a 2C I think, still learning. :)
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This little book is very handy to have if you are a curly girl! This book introduces the Curly Girl Method which is a huge breakthrough for all of us who grew up with unmanageable frizzy hair! As with many things, you have to use the information with care and do what works for you and reject what does not. I am glad I bought it and refer to it often. I have it 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel it could be a bit more dense on information with fewer personal experience stories. Also, I purchased the Kindle Edition and the audio does not work on the videos. All in all, however, a worthwhile purchase for anyone, male or female, child or adult, with curly hair!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Great, informative, chocked full of information. You just have to get passed the redundant, self-help style affirmations that are scattered throughout. Has each curl variations and their routines, product for and fonts, and recipes on how to make your own product. This is the best way to reinvigorate your hair and get it healthy.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Not to oversell this book, but it has changed my life. I once fought my curls with all that I had and thanks to this book I am learning to love my curls again. The newer 2nd edition is great because it is up to date and relevant for today's market of hair care products. It provides great pictures and instructions for each care and styling technique. The information is comprehensive for ""white girl"" curls, wavy hair, kinky ""ethnic"" curls, children's curls, men with curls, and even ""chemo-curls"" for those who have lost their hair to cancer treatments and are dealing with the hair that is growing back. There is information on what to look for and what to avoid in hair care products, information on how to trim your hair yourself, recipes for homemade hair treatments, styling ideas, the list goes on!The new edition also has a DVD which shows you what the book tells you. It is a helpful supplement to the book. My only complaint with the DVD is that the videos seem a bit rushed and I wish they would have taken their time presenting the information. However since everything that is in the video is also in the book, you can still get all the information.Honestly, if you have curly or wavy hair, get this book. Even if you do not follow the techniques completely, you will benefit from all the information in the book as well as the great ""Curl Confessions"" -- stories from fellow curly haired people that make you feel like you are not only battling with your hair. The book was the best $10 bucks I've spent in a long time.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I'm a curly haired girl, and the one thing I got from the book beyond all the different tools, and techniques on how to beautify your beautiful curls, is that acceptance is key! It comes with a DVD, and affordable enough, that even if you know most of the tips, and tricks from dealing with your own curly hair throughout the years, it gave me the affirmation I needed to accept my curly hair, but that doesn't mean I don't like to change it up with a flat iron, and a comb occassionally, but I definitely wear my hair curly more frequently these days!The book was the validation I needed to know it's okay to be a curly girl! Remember: ""Acceptance is key! And, once you accept your'-curly hair, you'll luv your' hair more than you ever have in the past!

Useful book. I've had a hangup (who doesn't) about not wanting to look like my mum, all my life. After reading this book I embraced curly hair and tried to go with it, not against it. All that hair drying while scrunching my hair ended up taking more time than simply not caring if my hair was curly or straight or someplace between. lol.Beauty and fashion books are wasted on me. However this book had the power to at least make me try to do something with my hair for all of six months until I gave up. For that it must have impressed me at the time i read it, so I'm giving it five stars. ;-)

I straightened my hair for over 10 years and I just wanted relief from it. My friend bought it for her daughter and told me to give it a try. The book is very sympathetic to those of use who's hair just seems so messy. Great tips for washing and caring for your hair. It turns out my hair has more curl to the waves than I knew! I have received a LOT of compliments on my hair since I started using her method for caring for it. From her instructions, I even cut my OWN hair for the first time. Soon after my crazy hair cutting experience, a barber (that specializes) in curly hair, said how much he likes my hair and that I should never change it!!! I totally blushed!

I'm 55 years old and thought my hair was getting less curly as I got older.  Wrong!  I probably had so much product built up my hair wouldn't curl properly anymore.  Thanks to this book, now I know what products I can and can't use on my curly hair.  My curls are full and bouncy again!

How did I manage to live 44 years on this earth and not know the secret to caring for my fabulous curly hair?!This book showed me how to wash it, condition it, style it and even cut it if I were so inclined.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
It's a hit where as the author provides good understanding of the characteristics of curly hair and how those who struggled with it have come to embrace their tresses. It's a miss because the information is more general than specific.  It include information for various ethnic hair types but not in great detail. Americans from the black culture or other ethnic groups (African, Caribbean, Cuban,French)who are not Caucasian will find general not specific information regarding their hair types especially for natural hair gurus. YouTube is a better source to find information for those looking for great information for natural hair tutorials, product reviews',and how to care for natural hair. I give it three stars for proving good information on basic hair care.

This book helped me get over all of the false ideas of hiding my curly hair. I now embrace whatever my hair wants to do and I OWN it! Lots of tips and useful information for all curly hair types. I now never straighten my hair and damage the heck out of it because this book helped me understand my hair and it's needs. Thank you Lorraine Massey for opening my eyes to a beautiful world of curly hair. I now get comments on how beautiful my hair looks and it grows so fast now that I quit damaging it with heating tools. Love my hair now!

My hairdresser bought this book in order to style my hair better and learn a bit more about how to deal with thick, curly hair. She let me borrow it, and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It covers everything, and has recipes for ""hair potions"" inside. I haven't made any yet, so I can't testify to their effectiveness. Even if you don't buy the products suggested, it is still a great book, with a lot of useful tips. My favorite parts are the sections called ""Curl Confession."" They are about women who never accepted their hair due to being made fun of in school or by family members. After trying the Curly Girl method, they learned to accept themselves for who they are. And their curly hair too! Highly recommend.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Excellent Book. I have learnt so much more about my Curly kinky hair. First off I am African American. I have the Fractal or Zigzag curl. I have big chop almost a 1year and half. Lot of trials and tribulations. I wish I had this book from the start. At first when I started to follow the method I was scared to really touch it because of her always saying about the frizz it would created so I would end up with stiff hair and lots of shrinkage. However I stuck with it.Then I learned that it is technique. You do it over and over again and your technique gets better and your curls transformed. I thought I had tiny little ringlets and now those ringlets are big and gorgeous. It is just so easy. Just get in shower soak hair put in conditioner let it sit for awhile. I even had a dry spot on crown and did not know it until I started this method. Now it is all gone. After leaving conditioner in for awhile I just rinse a little bit now with shower I just cup my hands under shower and pour over head. Then I proceed to put in more conditioner. Hair is soaking wet and I am finger combing a lot. Separating the curls. I do not stay in shower while I am doing this. I get out put towel around neck and proceed to finger comb with conditioner in hair. Then I take gel and finger comb very well making sure I get ever curl. Then I shake shake shake and shake hair with head down and side to side and that is it. All done for a couple of days. At night all I do is put my hair in ponytails because of my hair not being long but if you have long hair you can just pineapple it.  Also next morning before I take ponytails out I spray all of the with the lavender spritz and I soak them. Then I take ponytail holders off and shake head again...Also most African Americans are questioning about oiling of hair. She does talk about it in the book. Just let me tell you, you will not need them. At first when you start this method your hair will be somewhat dry however as time goes on and your hair gets healthier you will not need it. Once a week I do the scrub just with sugar and conditioner. I also add honey and mayonnaise for deep conditioner and olive oil. Leave on hair for awhile or overnight. Hair is just so healthy and easy to detangle.Everyone raves about my hair and it is just so shiny and the curls are so cute. I have three bi-racial grand kids and I can not wait to get my hands in their heads. Already talked to their moms. They do not know how fortunate they are with me showing their moms how to take care of their curls.Pros: Beautiful curls  Easy Read  Home made recipes for conditioning, exfoliating,spritz with lavender and heavy product build up cleanserCons:Video is worthless...Only reason I did not buy book use was because used books did not have video....Buy used do not need video

So discouraged with my curls. Found this book and it changed the way I cared for, wore and viewed my curls. This is is turn helped me to accept the real me and go with it confidently. Massey is thorough in the care and upkeep as well as bringing in real-life testimonies that really hit home on every level! I will always keep this book with me.

This book was so informative, I have shared it with all my curly haired friends and relatives.  I loved the classification scheme for different types of curls and the very high credibility of the content.  Anyone with wavy, curly, frizzy, nappy, flyaway, wild, bushy, coarse, fine, or combination hair will love the book's positive tone and empowering pride in exuberant tresses.  The many case studies of curly haired girls really validate that embracing and ""listening to "" your curly hair will liberate you and your hair!

This guide to caring for curly hair is already helping me. My itchy scalp is healing. My hair is picking up more curl every day. In fact, I am now seeing curls in my poor tortured bangs! I am going to keep this up for a few months, and see where my hair ends up. So far, following the Curly Girl method, things are looking pretty!UPDATE: I have used the curly girl method for several months now. Love the results! No longer using shampoo, and have found a good mix of gentle, flexible hair gels, and light conditioners sans SLS, silicones. My hair is awesome, and I'm constantly getting compliments on my curls!

This book is full of good information.  I was a 2c who had been wearing my hair straight forever!  I actually thought I had straight hair because I would always wash, blow dry and then straighten, I never saw what it could do if left alone.  After having 2 young kids, I don't have time for that, and my stylist told me my hair was curly and showed me how to style it.  Then I found this book and my hair is so nice now.  Curly and wavy, and its getting healthier now that I am not washing and drying it to death.  It seems to be getting curlier and curlier as time goes on.At first, I had a hard time going totally ""curly girl"" but over time I've even gotten used to not brushing or combing my hair.  my curls are soft and bouncy.  great book!

I am mixed, black-white, but my Mother has poker straight hair.  She has no clue how to ""deal"" with my hair.  My childhood was one long bad hair day.  I started researching natural hair and have read several books about the topic. I love my beautiful hair now and would not think of putting a chemical treatment in my hair.  I love this book so much because it is a good starting place for someone starting to work with natural curly hair.I like the fact that this book is a factual and practical guide to curly hair care without all the political agenda of the black natural hair discussion.I have referred several of my friends who have curly children to this book and even given it as a gift to one parent.  They all thank me, and thier children look great.  I have learned a lot since starting my journey, but most of the basics are in this excellent easy to read book.  Don't let your children develop a hate-hate realtionship with their curly hair, get this book!

I've struggled with my very curly, frizzy hair my entire life. This book has the best advice I've gotten for my specific hair type (Corkecelli curls). Just following the guide for the past month my hair looks better than I thought it could look.  My ringlets are more defined and I have more control over my ""frizz halo"".  My hair is developing good curl memory so other than drying time, there isn't tremendous styling effort on my part.  The only thing I haven't done is cut my hair dry & I'm too chicken to cut my own bangs!

I am a professional hairdresser always on the search for information on curl care and anything to do with texture. The book is a classic among curly folks and though it seems extreme in some ways- no heat, no shampoo, no silicones , etc.. I think the information in it about curl behavior and “science” is need to know info for all wavy, frizzy, and/or curly people as well as hair pros! It seems a bit dated but the info is timeless.

This book was a wonderful read, for my hair type.  It was a bit limiting, but there was a nice bit of info regarding conditioners, which I did not know.  For that alone, this book would have scored a solid 5.  However, I purchased the enhanced version thinking I could watch the embedded videos.  Wrong.  I have an Android tablet.  No Flash capability, nor can I install Flash.  By the by, cannot be installed on Kindle either.  Perhaps it's time to discontinue selling the enhanced version of this book, since one cannot view the embedded videos.  Aside from that, if you have curly hair and have always wanted to know how to better care for your beautifully curly tresses, then this is a fabulous read.

I've been blowing my hair out and using a flat iron forever. I'm tired of spending an hour blow drying and then another 45 minutes to flat iron only to end up with it pulled back into a ponytail because I went outside and it  grew to twice its size from humidity. My hair is long, thick and frizzy. I didn't realize that it was frizzy due to shampoo and the torture I'd been putting my poor hair through. I also purchased the no poo and the conditioner and the ultra gel. I eagerly read the book then jumped into the shower to try the methods in the book. My hair looks great and I've only been doing the curly girl method for two days, makes me excited to see how much better it will look with time I'm trying to embrace and love my curls, it will take time as I've spent a lifetime wishing for trying to have straight hair.

I bought this for my daughter, who was sad after her last haircut that her curls weren't doing their normal thing. She learned a lot of good information and techniques in this book & is happy to have her cute curls back.  =)  Such an awesome resource!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This has a lot of tips and good information for anyone wanting to go all the way to curly. Some of it is elementary and self-explanatory but there are a lot of things in this book that are very helpful and that one may not know or pick up on their own. Even though I am short and straight (my hair) now, and my curls are cut off and gone, I still use some of the advice and tips like making one's own spray mist to refresh curls, or in my case, to smooth down the crazy cowlicks I wake up with. A spray bottle, water and pure lavender oil to your preference level, and you have the homemade version of the spray Deva Curl sells for a stupid high price. It's worth reading for sure.

I stumbled across a blog on Pinterest about the Curly Girl movement. I started researching what it was all about because I have been fighting my curls for more than 50 years. I got the book and began my transformation to accept what God created: curly hair! Thank you for writing this book and showing how easy it is to stop the charade of “living straight” so I and other curly girls can be their true selves. Very inspiring book!

This book is a must have for people who are new to the curly world, and people who are thinking about going natural. If you are going naturally curly, or thinking about it then this book is for you. I am a black female who has been natural for a year and I just enjoyed reading the book. I like the regimen Loraine has for all curl types. Please believe me in saying that her regimen cannot go wrong with your hair, no matter the curl type. It is successful in replenishing moisture into your hair. I am not a wash n go girl, because it takes forever for my hair to dry, so I stick with twists and twist-outs. I wear a wash n go sometimes, but I like twists. I also use this technique on my daughter's hair. It saves us lots of money on expensive products. I mainly use Tresseme Naturals for my conditioner that I leave in, and co-wash with VO5. I did purchase the DevaCurl No-poo, but I haven't got around to using it just yet. The money for that doesn't bother me too much, because I will only be washing once a month. Overall, this book is a must have and share!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Wonderful book with many tips for wavy and curly hair.  I always thought my hair was just kind of wavy here and there.  But after following the suggestions in this book I have discovered that my hair has natural corkscrew curls.  Using the information provided has also gotten my hair into better condition.  Great book, especially if you want to style your hair with a more natural approach.  This is the second copy I have purchased, because it is a gift for a very curly haired friend of mine, who - unbelievably -  has never heard of ""The Curly Girl Method"".  I highly recommend this book.

I never knew I was a ""Curly Girl""! Great handbook on how to learn about your curly hair and take good care of it. Now I know why some days my hair looked great and other days it made me look like a tumbleweed was on my head! Even if you don't follow all the suggestions-at least you'll get a basic understanding of how to care for your curly hair. I was told about the Curly Girl book by someone I met on Facebook (who lives in the UK) and she said Amazon had the best price on it, and the products you may need for your hair. I love this book! And I love Amazon!

I've learned a lot from this book, it's very clear and easy to read.I consider that the contents are appropriate, but i would have like it more if the transitioning chapter was longer. Other than that i like a lot.I would recommend this books and the dvd to everyone who cares about their hair, not only curly haired people, because it's very instructive and useful.He aprendido mucho de este libro, es muy claro y fácil de leer.Considero que el contenido es apropiado, pero me hubiera gustado mas si el capitulo de transicion de pelo relajado/desrizado/alisado a natural hubiera sido mas extenso y explicativo. Aparte de eso me gusta mucho.Yo recomendaria este libro y el dvd a todo aquel que se preocupa por su cabello, no solo las personas de pelo rizado porque es muy instructivo y util.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Revolutionary! My friend told me about how she had been using the techniques described in this book and her curly locks looked gorgeous! She didn't even know that I had wavy hair because I've always blow-frayed and used a flat iron to style my hair. That was my stylist's answer for my ""frizzy"" hair. As a result I've kept my hair in a short bob style due to the damage from all these years of drying it out to straighten it. I've always wanted to grow my hair out and now I can! Thanks to The Curly Girl Handbook I'm on my way to having healthy gorgeous wavy locks and I couldn't be happier! I definitely recommend this book to every curly girl and to all those wavy girls who have been told you have straight hair. Liberate your curly tresses and love your hair with the tips from this book!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I am a late in life curly girl so I desperately needed this book to help me learn how to deal with my new found curls. The book taught me a lot about how to treat my curls, but the products do nothing for me. The no shampoo idea does not work for me at all. My hair looked and felt awful. I tried the no-poo and conditioner in conjunction with the gel and hated everything about it. My hair was frizzier than ever before and looked dull and lifeless. I searched all over the internet for a curly girl support group to help me learn to love this product but found nothing. I'm just sticking to the principles in the book but using different products and am now happier than ever with my curls even though I am shampooing my scalp (not the ends) daily.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
So much good information for all us curly girls. Had no idea there was so much I didn't know about how to work with my curls.  Easy reading & packed with real information that helps us ""deal"" with our hair.  I had recently decided to stop torturing my curly hair with hair dryers, heat & flat irons, so I'm glad I found this little book. Seems I've been doing so many things to my hair that were just wrong.  The book is written by the founder of Deva Curl products.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I won't go into a detailed review of this book because that has pretty much been done already. My one input into the book is this:Not the salon that I went to or the book has said what to do for your SECOND day.  How to get my hair to look as good the second day as first day without wetting and washing my hair again.  There is really no discussion of methods, only the recipes.Hence the 4 star review.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have thin, fine, frizzy, and curly hair! I loved this book. It helps you redirect your anger for not having ""everyone"" else's hair and to love and protect your own To cherish and embrace your hair. I also have learned about cleansing conditioner. I very rarely if ever use shampoo any more. Curly hair takes more work than straight hair- that's a given, but if you become accustomed to to do's and don'ts the journey to YOUR beautful locks will be easier and less stressful! I promise!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Just what I was looking for. It's almost too simple. Why didn't I realize just how parched my hair was? I've tried sooo many products! I read the whole thing but focused on the nice section for black hair. My 4c low porosity hair was a struggle. I was also sick and tired of the work and time involved with twists and twist outs. They would never last for me either. I followed the method to a tee. So that meant wetting it everyday and tolerating shrinkage. Low and behold, after a while I noticed that my curls would last the next day without re-wetting! At this point I can go three days with well defined curls that's how much moisture I've retained! I use kinky curly curling custard gel (Hawaiian silky or miss Jessie works just as well) and because of that I have to wash out some of the leave in conditioner that is recommended so there isn't too much product build up.  Once in a while I do a baking soda wash with an apple cider vinegar rinse if I feel there's too much build up. But my hair soaks up conditioner like a sponge so it's not needed too often. Thanks Lorraine Massey!

Here's why, the author was my hairdresser for 15 years in NYC.  She's awesome and believe she's quite passionate about this subject as she herself has naturally curly hair.  So, it's great to see this update to her book; it gives more detailed information than the first and includes other information that wasn't.  I'm no longer in NYC  : (  hoping to go back some day soon.  But, in the meantime I am able to find many stylists who have taken her courses and know how to cut curly hair the same way she does.  In between cuts, I get to care for my hair myself and this book is a must have for any curly haired person.  Would highly recommend.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I was unsure about buying this book because I have what I thought was only slightly wavy hair, and the book seemed to be oriented more toward people with definitely curly hair. I am very glad I took the risk and bought it. There is an entire chapter devoted to the Curly Girl method for wavy hair. I only started using the method a few days ago, but already my hair is much wavier than I ever realized. I can't believe it's my own natural hair in the mirror! I am excited to see how my hair will look after a few weeks.The book doesn't really recommend specific products, only ingredients to avoid in products. It is not necessary to use expensive products, such as the DevaCurl system; I'm using only drugstore products. There are online communities devoted to curly hair that I've found helpful for identifying specific products.The book contains a lot of anecdotes from curly-haired women (and a few men), which were interesting to read, but I didn't really relate to personally, having hair that, prior to Curly Girl, appeared to be basically straight. The book is oriented more toward people with curly hair, but still has a lot of great information for wavy hair. If you're on the fence about this book, I would highly recommend buying it and giving the CG method a try.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book was a great read! Pretty much everything I  thought about my hair over the many years was spot on. It showed me how to really care for my hair and especially my child curly hair. Can't wait to put this into practice. Only reason I gave 3 stars was because ebook did not provide a video that was available to play.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I struggled for YEARS with my curly fine hair. I ordered this book after having my hair cut by a Deva-certified professional. The new cut in conjunction with new products (yes the overly priced Deva line, until I find something better/cheaper that is) and a new way of thinking has resulted in my hair finally looking the way I deserve it to. It's vibrant and bouncy, and even in the daily FL heat and humidity it retains its shape well. I'm still experimenting with products, styling techniques and homemade potions based on what's in this book, and I expect over the next few years to really nail down what works for my hair based on the info (and attitude) I learned in Curly Girl.

I bought this book two weeks ago at Barnes and Nobles and then ordered copies on Amazon for my friends. This is a wonderful resource for all hair types. I'm a Black female with corkicelli/(3b) curly hair and found the tips on how to wash and condition my hair so helpful. I learned that I've been mistreating my hair for years. Lorraine discusses trimming your curls at home, natural home conditioning potions and learning to work with your hair's natural curl pattern. Also, I highly recommend that you buy the book with the instructional DVD. Both of my friends called me to tell me how helpful this book it. This has become my go-to book and will continue to recommend or give it away to my newly natural friends and family.

The curly hair world can be awful. There are many things I had no idea about, such as taking care of and styling wavy, curly hair.  This book was a big help along with you tube.  If you are starting your curly - wavy hair journey, buy this book, very helpful.

This book was a great find!  I have  typically  wavy/slight curly hair but recently made the mistake of getting a perm.  Now my  hair is  dry and frizzy.  I'm hoping the tips in this book will help me add moisture back and redefine the curls I was hoping for.  I did buy  several of the Devacare products but unlike one of the other  reviewers...I didn't find this book  was written to promote them (maybe a previous edition?).  I had to  go searching for them online (through Amazon Prime).  I'm anxious to try them and will post reviews  after I use them a few times.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book echoed a lot of my own feelings about my curly hair-- not the parts about being traumatized, but the parts about you don't have to straighten your hair to look nice, you can be proud of your own hair, and knowing healthy hair is beautiful hair. I liked the tips for how to cut your own hair. I cut mine, and everyone at work was shocked I did it. They all said it looked great! I tried her cleansing technique for my style curls, and it really did look better. It's a bit time consuming for me, but I can't deny it works. Other people even complemented my curls that day.

This book opened my eyes to the way in treating my curly hair. I recommemded this book to a friend of mine whose daughter has natural curly hair and I will keep telling people about this book.I already tried the no-poo hair cleansing method, and it works!Thank you for a wonderful book!!!

First on content- I really enjoyed the book and found the information to be MOST helpful. After struggling with my curly hair for years I now know where I was going wrong. All kinds if wrong as it turns out. I am biracial and found the book to be lacking a bit for my hair type and for other women of color. But I got the basics and have been figuring out the rest on my own. If you have curly hair-read this! If your mixed or black and want to go natural- read this! There's no book that does it all but this comes close.I features- I absolutely LOVE the embedded video in the Kindle version of this. Awesome!

If you have curly hair, even if you don't wear it curly all the time, you owe it to yourself to read this book.  Always wearing your hair curly is the repeated focus of this book but even if you don't, you will learn more about how to take care of your hair, how to get it to look its best when curly, and how to come to terms with your hair (you curly gals know what I'm talking about).I have learned to treat my hair better whether wearing it straight or curly.  I've learned to accept my curliness, even though I like the freedom of mixing it up every now and then.  So read this.  It's good for the curly gal's soul.

I've ordered many of these to give away to 'curly girls' - my go to for everything involving curly hair - from shampoos/conditioners to styles, to how to cut curly hair.  AND IT ALL WORKS.  I have saved a lot of money maintaining my own hair.  I've even been cutting it for about 10 months.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This was a very boring, much too long book about curly and wavy hair of all types.  There was much repetition in the book and the testimonies were way too numerous.  They appeared to be used as filler to make the book longer.  This should have been a small paperback with just the instructions for different types of waves and curls without all the fluff of the testimonies and personal stories.  Only a small portion of the book is going to apply to any one person.  You find the type of curl you have, then go to the section for that curl to learn how to take care of it.  Done!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Been mistreating my hair forever! Didn't know how to properly take care of my hair - I would blow ""fry"" it (using expensive/professional blow dryers thinking that would do the trick), flat iron it (again, using the best flat iron brand) or use hot rollers, use all kinds of hair products and it would be beautiful until I walked out the house and then ""POOF""...humidity would destroy my efforts.  My hair was dull, never shiny, never manageable and had a halo of frizz.  I started using WEN products in January 2012, but I wasn't acheiving the desired results promised.  After 8 months, I FINALLY got fed up and actually thought about shaving my head (like Sinead O'Connor)!! Thank goodness I did a little research on curly hair and found this handbook.  I was so excited that I ordered it right away and told my curly/dry/frizzy sisters about it, too.  Boxed up my WEN (can't throw it out, yikes, too expensive) and found the DevaCurl products at the local ULTA store, not that you HAVE to use her products, I'm just one of those, if I'm going to try this, I might as well do it right. I did throw out loads of hair products that contained parabens, butane, propane...was horrified that I had been putting this stuff in my hair.  No wonder it was suffering!You can't be in denial of your curly hair...in fact, I thought I had just plain wavy hair until I started using this method..it's been about a month...I've got curls all over my head (like the gal on the cover, just not as gorgeous, YET!)  Still going through trial and error to get it right...like the book says...all curls are different.  There is a section on what to ask a stylist when trying to find someone to cut your curls.  I was lucky enough to have found a DEVACHAN trained hairdresser in the next town; having support to go all curly and get the right cut is tremendous!  Even if you haven't decided to commit, this book is a great easy read. The author's voice and sense of humor comes through loud and clear...she is so funny!  (Don't think it's corny...makes me smile.)  Also, made several of the homemade hair products.  They're great, too.

If you have curly or wavy hair this is a must read! I have wavy somewhat curly hair and one of my daughters has very curly hair. We both found the directions for cutting curly hair a tremendous help and we refer to the book often.

There are so many things I've learned about curly hair while reading this book. The best part, the path to treating curly hair right is easier, less time consuming, and cheaper than the straight alternative. To my surprise the majority of the recommended products are super cheap and readily available at my grocery store. Long story short, take the curly girl plunge. You will not regret it. And that, is a promise.

I discovered the Curly Girl method on the internet and was told to order the book if I wanted to really get a good grasp of all the information I needed.The Curly Girl Handbook is well organized and gives you lots of great pictures to help you understand what you're reading. I read the whole thing in a couple hours and really enjoyed it. I learned a lot and have been a Curly Girl for over a month now. The methods explained really do work. If you are hesitant, check out [...] forums and look at some of the before and after pictures. I'm a true Curly Girl now and I love having hair that I enjoy rather than hate!
"

Mainly a good book for long curly hair. Not much advise for short wavy hair. Also Deva Curl products are very toxic so I don't use them. But there are some recipes to make your own hair care products in this book which I recommend. There is also advise on how to cut your own hair. I bought the Hikari scissors that she recommends, and I cut my own hair. Saves money in the long run. http://www.hikariscissors.com

I bought four copies of this book, all for gifts.  One gift was for a household member, so I use it, as well.  This book has so many amazing tidbits to offer about curly hair.  The included VD really helps in visualizing the techniques, so I heartily recommend watching it.  My 15 year old went from not really knowing how to handle her lovely, loose curls to embracing them fully because of the advice and techniques in this book.  We have been using the methods since just after Christmas, and the results have been impressive.  Both of us get constant compliments about our curls.

I love this book. It has helped me so much with my hair. The information is invaluable if you have curly hair. My mom and dad had straight hair, so I really didn't have anyone growing up that had curly hair to help me take care of it. I have always hated my hair. I wore more ponytails and buns that anyone else because I never wanted to deal with my hair. This book has helped me so much to understand why my hair does what it does and what my hair needs. After a week, my hair just looks so much better. After a month, I have completely different hair. I recommend this book for any one with curly hair. This will help so much.

If you have waves, frizz or you hate your curly hair, get the book and follow the rules, I am two weeks in to the rules and I love my curls more and more every day!  You will be amazed!  It's an adjustment at first if you usually don't wear our hair curly, an be prepared for people at work to continually ask you if they can touch your curls and if you got a perm.  LOL!  They are so amazed I've been hiding these curls the last 12 years!

....but I will try not to. I grew up in eastern Canada close to Lake Erie where it wasn't uncommon to see the temperature reach 100 degrees Farenheit (before they went metric) and 100% humidity....yes, at the same time. It was like being in a steam bath, a hot steam bath...with mosquitos. And I was blessed with curly hair and my dear Mum's was naturally straight.  That meant she had no idea what to do with mine. She meant well when she gave me a Toni home permanent. After all, perms worked for her! I spent that summer with a bush on my head. When I reached my teens I began wearing rollers, hard ones, to bed, so my hair would be smooth for school. Fast forward to 2012. I am a senior citizen now, living in California, where at least humidity is not a problem. But all these years I have struggled to subdue my curls. No more! I discovered Curly Girl while perusing Amazon. And voilà...here I am, a curly girl and proud of it! I ordered two books for a couple of curly friends and one for my daughter. All three have been liberated, in fact one friend said it has been a life changing experience. I am going to send a copy to a dear friend in Canada as well. Poor dear is still trying to subdue her curls. Now I actually look forward to doing my hair and I have been getting lots of compliments.  They probably think I've had a perm! Life is full of surprises and this was one of the best! Olivia Wilding

As a hairstylist with 15 years' experience, I thought I had heard just about everything related to hair. Boy, was I wrong! I am SOOO grateful to my customer who gave me this book a few years ago! It changed my life, for real! Now I actually love my hair! I recommend this book to every person who sits in my chair that has curly or wavy hair (as well as some fellow stylists!). There is an answer for just about every question or problem a curly girl (or guy) has. Even if you don't adhere to the suggestions in the book 100%, chances are that testing even ONE of the principles will help you out, and will make you want to try more!

I thought this would be how to treat curly hair. It is basically stories. Some tips in the book but nothing what I expected. I thought it would be recommended products, step by step processes. I was disappointed in the book. I would recommend to go to the library and look at the book first. I wish I had done that. I would not have ordered it.

I purchased this book after reading about it on the Curly Girl website. It is a good book if you are sick and tired and don't know what to do with you're curly mess, like I was.  It tells you I how to go ""no-poo"" and yes, it really does work. it also explains some ideas to transform your curly mess into a beautiful and healthy head of hair. I have worked with the ideas presented in this book, tweeking it according to my hair needs and type, and I believe it has helped me immensely.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has more anecdotal stories than I cared to read. Although very nice it just didn't have much information that I could otherwise get off of the Internet. If you are completely new to being curly this is a good place to start but to avoid spending cash I would just say spend some time on YouTube. I would not recommend this book for anyone who has a grip on how to work with their curls as oppose to against them. This book is also very limited to a certain type of curl. Overall it was a good read that I wish I would have borrowed instead of paid for.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Best resource for curls ever. I have had this book for a couple years now. I still reference it at times, and I always recommend and lend it to other women just exploring their curly side.I didn't go curly until my early 20's and then it took me another 5 years to accept it, and realize I needed help. Curly and straight are not the same, different down to the molecular level.This book makes it simple and easy to find a starting place for managing your curls, and turning them into healthy, juicy curls. You can NOT GO WRONG with this book.

The book is put together well and it is definitely informative, but between the DevaCurl website and the many sites and boards and videos out there dedicated to the ""curly girl"" method, you don't really need to purchase the book. If you like getting your information in printed form and you'd like it around as a reference, it's worth the purchase. But if you're just looking for one-time information and instructions on the curly girl method, try google first.

Wow!  This book is an eye opener for curly girls who always thought they were doomed to live a life of frizz.  Following this advice for about 6 months now.  No more frizz--even on humid days.  My hair is soft and moist and better than ever!

It was interesting reading this book and iblearned a few things about my hair. Just started transitioning to my natural curly hair a little over 2 months and this book helped guide me.

My daughter has curly hair and a friend of mine suggested this book to me, because as a straight haired woman I wasn’t sure how to get my daughter’s curls as bouncy as she wanted them. The book is wonderful with tons of great tips. The deva curl hair care line works wonders, which is Lorraine Massey’s product line. My daughter is loving how full and bouncy her hair looks and has stopped asking me to straighten it to fit in with her friends.

I found this book to be very informative and helpful as I learn how to enjoy my wavy/curly hair.  Some of the stories I really related to as I experienced situations similar during my own bad hair days. They do refer to their products often, but I chose to use the products and I don't mind.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book totally changed the way I cared for, and even thought of my hair. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has any sort of curl (including wave) to their hair. There's a chapter for everyone!

A lot of fluff, & kitschy type stories. Had some good tips, but honestly, not worth the $$.

If you have curly hair and are frustrated with it being out of control, buy this book. If you follow the directions for your type of hair, you will be thrilled with the results !!!

Trying to have straighter ""ordinary"" hair had been a lifelong pursuit... That changed several years ago when my right shoulder was injured and I could no longer torture my hair with heat, air and harsh products. I found DevaCurl haircare no-poo shampoo and conditioning products 6 months ago (thanks, Gail!) and then found the accompanying book a few months later. What an amazing difference, I have shiny healthy un-ordinary curls, my significant ""bother"" and I both love it.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Very informative. I wish it was longer and had more info on ingredients to look for/avoid and why. A great starting point for anyone considering letting their curly hair return to natural form. I’d argue it may be a good method for anyone with dry or damaged hair in general.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Great read but most information is on the internet. I enjoyed the personal experiences throughout the book.

If you have been unable to figure out the kind of curls you have, or their variability within your own head, this book will be the answer to your prayers!  It has ways to moisturizer, including home recipes, ways to manage, cut and wear your type of curls successfully.  I use it as a reference book from time to time, and you will, too.

I want to shove this book in the face of every curly girl I know. Everyone I know is doing it wrong. My hair is more bouncy resilient shiny luscious than it has ever been by using this method. I mean mind-blowing game changer

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
It is so amazing to finally know what I am supposed to do with my curly hair! Some of these things I have learned by trial and error but I lot I never knew. This book has been amazing and I feel so pleased to embrace my curls and know how to take care of them now. My hair looks so much better since I started using the  no-poo, conditioner, gel, drying towel and hooded dryer. I have started using them on one of my curly kids and am telling all my curly friends about it. Even brought the book  into my hairdresser and showed her how to cut my hair dry. Best haircut I've ever had!

Read the entire book in two sittings. Enourages curly girls to go natural, and gives helpful suggestions. Eye opening.

Just read the book and follow it while you experiment and get a routine down. I have been four months now not using any heat other than a defused on medium heat. I have not colored my hair either and that has helped enhance my curls. I may color my hair soon but will find someone that will use Olaplex with the color to lessen the damage. I have turned from frizz to fabulous!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
i was so happy to discover this book. I am a 57 year old woman who has wrestled with her hair all my life.  I have absolutely detested my thick course unruly curly, wavy frizzy hair. I have in the past straightened my hair but my husband told me I looked like everyone else so I have tried and tried to make it look presentable.  I have always envied people with straight hair as I thought they looked attractive and people like me didn't.  I stumbled across the curly hair website while reading an article in my local paper and it has lead me to this fantastic book. I have studied this book like a thesis and I am coming to terms with living with curly hair.  I think I am beginning to like it.  People ask me every day what am I doing different and customers want to know what I do to get great curls.  My only small problem is that I live in Australia and the products recommended are not available in stores.  I am managing to source  other products that work well but i would love an opportunity to have access to as many products that are available in the US.  Lastly, I have had short hair for many many years as I always found this a better option for me but with the discovery of my new curly look I have decided to let it grown.  Not sure how long but it will be a great adventure with my new products and book.  Would highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to feel good about themselves and their curls.

Well...I bought the book cuz I just got a really curly perm and my hair is now pretty dry. Great info in it.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
My daughter has extremely tight curls and I have poker straight hair.  I had no idea how to care for her hair.  A friends mom was a stylist and recommended this book.  It's awesome.  Not only does it tell you how to care for curly hair but how to embrace it and love it.  Her hair is so much healthier and has fewer ""knots"" than it ever had.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has changed my life and has saved me tons of time getting ready every day.  It took a good 6 weeks to fully grasp my routine and I nearly went back to blow drying, hot irons, and curling irons.  So happy that I didn't.  I got ready in about 20 minutes this morning....including shower, makeup, and getting dressed.  I've learned to go two, three days using a refresher mist in the morning as opposed to full hair cleansing...four if I put my hair in a bun!  The time I've saved eliminating the daily blow dryer by itself has given me much more sleep time!  I've made several of the recipes in the book and use daily.  Spot cleaning with lavender mist, refreshing curls with conditioner/water mister, adding shine to dull hair with another very easy-to-use recipe that I can't recall the name.  Anyway, if you're thinking of doing this method, buy the book.  There is much more information in it than you can find online.  Also, give yourself time adjusting to the look.  I thought I had thick, course hair that I blow dried straight and then either curled or hot ironed.  I had no idea that I had ringlets and S waves throughout my hair.  Getting adjusted to the new ""ever changing"" look took time.  Now I love it and embrace it.

This book is thorough and very fun to read!!! Great information on how to get a good haircut because a lot of stylists truly don't know how to handle curls and waves.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
OMG!  I wish this book was around when I was a kid.  I have curly hair and this book was a lifesaver.  Lorraine has so many tips for all hair types.  She taught me how to embrace and care for my delicate, beautiful curls.  It's my bible. If you have curls, you need this book!!!!  She explains so much and opened my eyes to things I didn't know.  Don't fight your curls, love and embrace them.

Very helpful for us CurlyGirl gals who are just getting started.  Nice to have the video too.  I've watched it several times.  I also purchased this for my hair stylist so that she could understand better us CurlyGirls.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I am so glad I came across this book.  For years, decades really, I didn't know what to do with my curly hair.  Well I do now!  The suggestions in this book are spot on.  My hair is in much better condition and looks better too after following the advice of Lorraine Massey.  If you have curly or even wavy hair, you cannot go wrong with this purchase.  If you know someone with curly/wavy hair this would make a great gift.  I know I wish I had this long ago.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has changed my attitude towards my hair.  I have extremely thick wavy frizzy hair, but not anymore!  With this book, my hair is changing for the better (more curls, less frizz) and I have only been using the curly girl method for about 2 weeks!  I definitely recommend it for anyone with wavy or curly hair.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have been fighting curls all my life. Not knowing how to care for curly hair ensured a head full of frizz rather than curls when I was a child. A few months ago I Decided no more fighting my curls. This book is awesome and has inspired me to continue my quest for the perfect curls.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I love this book and recommend it to every curly girl I meet, even if they are random strangers I strike up a conversation with.  I really like how the author does not push her products on you.  Instead, she gives guidelines for how to find a product that will help you have the best curls ever.  I've even given the book as a gift to friends.  Growing up with Shirley Temple like curls has not always be fun or easy.  Finally, as an adult, the book has helped me care for my curls so that I love them and be proud to be a curly girl.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I came across this book while considering a very short hair cut because I was sick of the time and effort it took to wear my wavy/curly hair straight. At first some of the suggestions seemed crazy, no shampoo? no brushing or combing? But I decided to give it a try and if it didn't work, I'd continue with my plan for a new short style. I found a DevaCurl stylist and she gave me a curly girl hair trim, showed me how to style my curls, got the products that do not contain all the harsh and damaging chemicals (silicone, alcohol, etc)and began the process. This is week three and my hair is looking and feeling great. My curls have become more defined and bouncy and I don't spend an hour every morning with a blow dryer and flat iron. I don't panic when it's raining, which used to make my hair turn frizzy. Now it just perks up my curls. If you have curly or wavy hair and you're struggling with how to live with it, you need to read this book.

Curls are wild and crazy and come in a wide range of varieties.  This book explains a lot about the different curl types and how to embrace them and care for them for all they were meant to be! Hey guys!  It's for you too!

I have finally been liberated! After reading this book I have the confidence to rock my natural curls.  I've always been told that I should wear my hair curly but I did not have the courage.  This book is amazing and I am NEVER going back to blow frying my hair.  I've even lost some weight because now I do not worry abut sweating during my workouts. I would like to see a 3rd edition of this book with an  even more detailed section on multi-cultural hair. Curly Girls Unite!BTW the products I use for my curls are:No-Poo, Heavenly Hair and Angel Curl.

I'm not quite done reading, however, I'm frustrated that I paid full price for the PC Version of this book and there's no video - not even URL links. Why ipad and Kindle Fire only when PC supports any video format?  Does anyone know where they are?
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
My wife and daughter both have curly hair, and this book has helped them reduce the frizziness that vexed them for so long. A great purchase.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
great book to build a foundation with. you really learn how to read product labels, etc. she really tells you how to take care of your hair more than anything. if you want to read this book to gain hair knowledge and still use silicones, then that's okay too. if you do use silicones though, use a sulfate shampoo to wash them out.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I delved into this book and the methods outlined with such enthusiasm.  I'm a little disappointed for myself.Positives:  My daughters have 3c and 4a (if you are into the hair typing system) already definable curls.  Their hair responds well to the sulfate-free shampoo, feels softer after ditching the silicone-laden conditioners and looks fuller and less frizzy after donating my Denman brush - again per Massey's advice.  Lorraine Massey in her book and during interviews does not advocate the use of combs and brushes - not even brushes supposedly designed for curly hair.  In one interview, she said that Denman brushes cause frizz, breakage, and disperses your curls causing your curls to have to find their way again.From my experience, I have found this to be true about Denman brushes. I would add that using those brushes also causes your curls that do clump to shrink further onto themselves - making your curls appear shorter. But that's a different subject.IMPORTANT FOR THOSE OF US WITH SMALLER OR TIGHTER CURLS:  If you are using the Curly Girl method and have 3c or 4a curls, finger-combing your hair en masse or in two sections per the photographs in Massey's book may make your hair look frizzy and your curls probably won't clump properly.  That was my experience on myself and my daughters.  My daughters' natural curls looked better defined once I divided their thick hair and mine into more sections and finger-detangled each section separately.For my tween daughters after a month of trying the Curly Girl method, I have no negatives to report.  They have beautifully defined shiny curls, I didn't have to buy an avalanche of trendy, pricey curl-defining products to get this look.  Hair care is fairly simple, cheap (you don't have to use the $30 a bottle DevaCurl Products Massey touts - any sulfate-free shampoo or silicone-free product that you like should be fine), and my daughters get tons of compliments.  Their hair responds well to leaving conditioner in the hair as Massey suggests.For me - different story.  My hair looks okay while it's wet or damp.  The curls clump.  My hair feels soft, softer than it did when I used silicones but it's not gleaming.  It looks powder-dull and a little brittle.  I'm not sure why.  I am under 40, I don't have any chemicals in my hair.  I don't use heat.  I don't have heat damage anymore since my haircut.My hair just doesn't look as good as it did when I was simply wearing twist-outs, bantu knot-outs, braid-outs or up-do's.  The curls on me (not on everyone) look sort of dated, and little severe.  I just feel I look unflattering wearing a cap of curls (my hair is about four inches long all over stretched).  Massey said that your natural curls can make you look younger.  Well, not me.  Perhaps my hair will look better once it's longer?  I don't know.  I feel now they make me look mousy or like a throwback from an 80's poster.  This is not the image I want to project.Am I crazy?  Does anyone else have this experience?Also, should people born with curly hair only wear it curly whether it suits them or not? I don't think so.For now, because I do like how my curls clump, I like finger-detangling (I lose less hair) and I like how soft my hair feels I will continue using the Curly Girl method but I will only be wearing my hair in twist-outs, braid-outs, etc. until it grows out a little more.  Perhaps my curls will look better when my hair is longer.That said, I'm glad that she has inspired and helped others, including my daughters.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I really liked this book. I've always had naturally curly hair but have never had any special tips on how to care for it. Curly Girl gave me those tips, from types of shampoo to use (this had made a tremendous difference!) to how to shampoo to which type of curls I have. I didn't know there was a difference until now. It does show tips on how to cut your own hair, which is a bit far-fetched for me but maybe I'll try it soon. It's almost impossible to find someone who knows how to cut curly hair. I've only had two really good haircuts in my life. I wish I had found this book many years ago.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has everything you need to know to care for curly hair.  We adopted a little girl with cork screw curls and were thoroughly clueless as to what to do with it.  This book helped me not only to figure out my daughters hair, but I figured out what I was doing wrong with my wavy hair.  We were able to identify the curl type and how best to care for the individual type of curls.  It has recipes for homemade deep conditioners and is chalked full of know how and ideas.  If you need to know how to care for curly hair this book is the best.

I'm a man with curly hair. I've kept it very short for decades, because I had no idea how else to handle it. This book is just as applicable to men as women, near as I can tell. I've been growing my hair longer as I learn to handle my curls, using the deva products and now also the methods in this book. Now I can tame my curls even in humid weather and reliably get several styles out of it that can even survive a day at work or hours of dancing.

When starting my natural healthy hair journey I didn't know where to start. I heard a lot of good things about this book so I decided to purchase it. A lot of questions that I ad concerning my hair was answered when I purchased this book. This book is really helpful because at times when Minot for sure about something relating to my hair I def refer back to this book. I would highly recommend this to a newly naturalista on his or her healthy hair journey.

Excellent gift idea for curly girls, teens. Got it for my stepdaughter, she likes it

The method and home-made recipes are excellent (5 stars)... the stories sound too self-therapy, and that may work for other target-audience
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I think pretty much every curly girl grew up hating her hair.  I started liking mine better a few years ago after doing a few of the things this book recommends.  But this book puts it all together.  And I love DevaCurl products.  I've never been one to straighten my hair.  But I had cut it short because I was sick of dealing with it.  And, while I loved it short, this book has given me the courage to grow it out again.  And it's going well!  I think I'll be able to have it long again and not just put it up or pull it back!

If you are a curly girl looking for where to start your curly hair journey, buy this book! Like right now! It's so informative and I personally related to most of stories in this book. It's written very well. I bought this on my kindle, so it included the videos, which was very helpful. I would recommend this book to all curly girls out there! It's a must read.

Really great book and very informative for curls. I am a stylist who works at a Deva Trained Salon, and we recommend this book to clients who have trouble with daily styling/tips/ understanding their curls. I agree with most things in the book, except, she really doesn't want people to wash their hair ever and I personally have found using shampoo (not all the time) is still best.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Great information! Extremely helpful and detailed, I highly recommend
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book is okay for curly hair but not necessarily Afro-textured hair.  There is good information (use a lot of conditioner, do not use combs or brushes, etc) and there are a few recipes (hair moisturizers, etc) but this book is basic.  In THE SCIENCE OF BLACK HAIR, you will find the same information, better methods, and SO MUCH MORE.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have 3c tight-curly hair that is mid back length, a lot of it and fine in texture.  This book has some awesome tips, but the daily routine is too time consuming.  I can't see drenching my hair in the shower each day, my hair takes forever to dry.  Plus I don't like using gel on my hair, as even the alcohol and silicone free ones tend to dry out my hair.  If you have tight-curly hair your results could go either way.  I purchased this book along with ""Curly Like Me"" by Teri LaFlesh.  The combined results have been spectacular.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
So many helpful hints for kinky and curly hair.  This product line and book has helped me transition from straightening my hair for many years, to going natural.  I did not know there were so many similarities to all curly hair types (African American, Caucasion, and Latino textures).  All lack moisture, it's just a matter of how much we need to put back in to our hair.  I am so glad women are embracing their natural textures all over the world.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Super helpful and effective! After you read it, find a Curly Girl support group on Facebook and get some help figuring out how to apply it.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I gave Curly girls this rating because though it speaks on all types it is referenced more for the more Caucasian group,  than African American.  It does have some great information on products and merchandise.  I hope that those who enjoy their curls in the 1A to 3B find this book category consider this book but I'd you are 3C and further kinkiest,  you may want to check out yahoo for tips or do your own personal research.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I had heard about this book for awhile, and I don't know why I waited so long to get it. I think the author does a great job of explaining the science behind hair care and gives excellent tips. She does come across as a little preachy at times, because clearly she has strong feelings about not damaging hair and keeping it naturally beautiful. The ebook version on my ipad is AWESOME. Instructional videos are interspersed in the text so that you can watch as you go seamlessly. Plus, having your reading interrupted by shower scenes is just fun...
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Great and helpful advice. My mom starting respecting and working with her curly hair many years ago and tried to get me to follow. After reading this book I realized  she had given me the exact advice! Well, now I am convinced! I think back to the days when I had good curl days and a lot of the time it was because I had done a similar routine. I know I can become happier with my curls and make them beautiful and frizz-free from the knowledge I gained from this book.

I have pretty hair thanks to Curly Girl. Whenever I see a Curly girl with curly hair I go up to her and say ""I just found this awesome book it has TRANSFORMED my curls and taught me how to take care of them. Check out The Curly Girl handbook."" I usually get a positive response. I really should be in sales! :) I tell them about Deva Curl products. We talk a minute or two. And I leave feeling like I am spreading the goodness for all to enjoy!

A lot of good information in this book.  I've been straightening my curly hair for almost 20 years now---Not anymore!  Great tips on how to get the curl back without the frizz.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book pretty much changed my attitude towards my hair and life in general.  Always liked curls, but didn't realize my own hair was wavy-curly.  If I just love it and treat it with gentleness and respect, it's got everything I ever wanted in my hair.  (And the same attitude applies to the rest of my life: turns out that a little love and acceptance made all of it better).  Book provides detailed photographs and instructions for cleaning, conditioning, drying, and wearing curly hair of any and all curl types.  Separate chapters on men's hair, dyeing or going gray-curly, multi-curl-tural hair, raising children to understand and love their curls, even a chapter on chemo curls.  Many materials available out there to learn how to care for multicultural hair, but this book also deals with looser curls and waves.  Go natural, lose the urge to straighten, love your curls.

Why is it at my age, I'm still learning how to care for my body?! This book is great. I have definitely learned a lot about caring for my curls. Starting with a curl care professional hair dresser to cut it properly. Mothers need this for their curly kids. I think we all need to start on silk or satin pillow cases young :-).
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey and the products she has produced (DevaCurl)were just what I, and many others, needed who are learning to love who they are, what kind of hair they have and how to care for it naturally.  Years ago I at a time in my life when my husband requested I not color my hair anymore, but instead just be myself, I learned how to love what God has given me and my unique appearance.  I read the book, ""Going Gray"", about learning to love your gray hair and it was good for me at that time.  In fact, I shared my new outlook with others when they complimented me on my hair, or vice versa. Then there were people who told me that after a certain age, women shouldn't wear their hair long.  They would bug me to cut my hair like theirs, short and spiky. I have had long hair most of my life and that is who I am.  My husband liked it that way and I looked good with it, so there was another decision to make.  Now I am excited to tell you how great it was to find other 'curly girls' (girlygirl.com) who cannot or do not want to have straight hair even if  most of the celebrities are setting that fashion.  We love our curly/wavy hair and we want to know how to care for it.  Curly Girl is the manual you need to do this.  It covers all kinds of issues, how-to's, types of curls, and how to care for them and has many ""curl confessions"" from other's experiences.  There's even a DVD to watch for clearer explanations, or to share with your friends. I challenge you to be who you are and check out this book.  It's worth the money.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I had no idea how little I knew about curly hair until I bought this book. It is a quick read but packed with incredibly important information for anyone with even a little bit of wave to their hair. Incredibly affordable and something that everyone should own if they have curls. Could not recommend it enough!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I liked it a lot. I was eager to read this book since I saw many comments about it online. It has the basics about the CGM and how to identify what type of hair you have. But if you wanna go deeper into detail, there is not much information about the excess or deficiency of protein or moisture and other stuff which you have to figure out on the go.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Pardon the term zealot but I agree with most of the book except I have always told my daughter one of the beauties of having cutting hair is we can straighten one day and return to curly with next shampoo. So I don't understand the opinion that straightening the hair occasionally is the ultimate evil. Variety is the spice of life and you do it once a month or less often I doubt it's going to hurt your hair.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
No more straightening.  No more blow drying. This book is the ultimate training tool for those who just can't stand to see their untamed curly hair in a ponytail ever again.  Great easy to follow step by step instructions.  It took me almost 60 years to learn to treat my curly hair the right way.  You don't need to wait that long, I highly recommend this second edition book with cd.  If you decide to make the change look on their website to locate a hairstylist trained to cut using the deva curl method.

"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Loved the info. I now realize that curls need lots of moisture and it's ok to moisture them! As it is a must for us curly folks. I realized while reading this book that Curls are curls regardless of race. They need care and love and do not see color-they can't see anything but moisture...lol! That's all they know. They only know they need moisture and tender love and care. Really helped me to break the barrier of washing hair without shampoo. Thank you! Good book but you'll still have to do research and trial and error. It is a Good book for naturals who are beginning hair journey.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I LOVE this book. I loved the original book. I was finally at the point where I was accepting and embracing my curls when I discovered the original Curly Girl Handbook. The tips and techniques in both books have helped me to LOVE MY CURLS. I honestly can't remember the last time I straightened my hair. Every curly girl should have this book; even if you don't use all the techniques, you'll appreciate the natural beauty that is you. I buy this book for just about all of my curly friends/family.

Many good ideas. I even found a local (and I live in a remote area) Deva Curl hair dresser! I need to reread and really follow some of the suggestions for better results-my fault.. It is a process. My hair is easier to manage-less tangles and feels better. I actually can do a second day and if I am pushing it a 3rd day hair which is awesome for travel.

Great book.  My daughter's hair has become curly in the past year...and I have had no idea on how to care for it.  She read the book nearly in it's entirety and even after one attempt it is so much better and less frizzy. She is also getting used to the idea that her curl is around to stay!

The book is great however, contrary to the product description pictured, it did NOT include a DVD.  This was a disappointment but the book alone is still worth what I paid for it so I did not deduct any stars.

This book is a MUST read for learning to care for curly/ wavy hair!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I'd figured out most of the info in this book on my own, years ago.  But I've been on a curly girl journey for a long time so I've had many years to experiment!  These days, it's easy enough to find sulfate free shampoos.  The botanical conditioners and alcohol-free gel, not so much.  I understand that formulations change, but a list of products that currently meet the Curly Girl criteria would be a helpful jumping off point.The author provides a section on recipes for home made treatments.  One of them, a scrub, calls for quinoa mixed with conditioner.  How, I wonder, is one to rinse that out in the shower without totally plugging up the drain?  As another reviewer mentioned, there's an annoying amount of space devoted to personal stories and useless filler.  I could ignore these things and others if only the author had provided a list of recommended products...or a web site for an up-to-the-minute list.  Had she done that, I'd give the book 5 stars, warts and all.

This book changed my life!  I think that every middle school and high school needs to have this book in their library so younger girls can learn how to care for their hair!My book came with a DVD.  It was very faded and hard to see when played.  But the book offered plenty of information so the DVD was just a bonus.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I wanted to write a review for those who already own the earlier (2001) edition of Massey's book to say that this new, updated version is definitely worth the purchase!  I had been worried that the book would repeat a lot of the information from the previous book, and, while there is some overlap, much of the text is new and the new photos and curl categories are really helpful.  I had also been worried that the book would really promote/push Massey's DevaCurl line of products, but it doesn't at all.  Overall, this new edition includes a lot more information than the original book -- and the DVD that accompanies it is excellent!I just started using the Curly Girl method about 1 1/2 months ago to bring out the wave in my hair, and so far the results have been amazing.  My hair is curlier and looks better than it ever has, and it's nicely moisturized.  I can't wait to see what results I'll get after following the method for a longer period of time!

Learned a lot about how to fix my crazy curly hair! Amazing information there!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Ive tried every product and method out there and none of them worked long term. A lot of what's in this book makes sense but is unconventional. I always noticed my hair looks awesome after 4 days of not washing it but this book told me why that makes sense for me. Must read for anyone that does not have naturally stick straight hair
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
The book is a solid read for curly or wavy heads!  It is an easy read with some great suggestions in dealing with curly and wavy hair issues.  Also, a few good DIY recipes.  Highly recommend.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I am completely in love with this book! I talk about it all the time to people who I know have curly hair but straighten their hair all time. I like my curly hair but never really accepted them and after reading Curly Girl, I can say I'm on my way to doing so. Really great book, with tips I had heard of but also some newer info I had never known about. My favorite part of the book is the personal stories from different people and how they felt about their curls before going natural! So if you're looking to embrace your curls and how to get them looking their best, this is a great way to begin.

Best book my wife has ever read concerning curly hair control. She has followed several of the ideas in the book and has achieved great results. She has loaned this book to several friends and they too have received several new ideas to try on their hair.

I bought another book for curly/natural women months ago and still have not finished that book.  I got this book after a friend of mine told me she couldn't put it down and even bought the mp3 version because she wanted to have it near by and couldn't wait to read it again. I read this book in 2 days...could have been 1 day but got the book after work and couldn't put it down.  I love the different stories from other naturals/curly girls it was inspiring.  Mostly every curly girl/natural can tell you...it's a hard journey and this books gives such great tips.  I never thought I could go without a comb or brush.  I haven't picked one up after reading this book.  Love the book and I tell everyone I can so that they can get the same encouragement and great tips! The only bad thing about this book was that it was too short!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
My hair was always so fluffy and, well, ugly, haha. I had no idea it was as curly as it was. I was doing everything I shouldn't have and since I changed my regimen to what this book says, it's actually cute. Thank goodness there was something to help me learn how to take care of my hair! No one in my family had curly hair so I just did which worked fine for them, but made me look like a puffball.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Excellent book.  I've been trying to cope with my curly hair for ALL of my life.  I fought it through most of my childhood, either hiding it or straightening it with every tool or product that I could find.  It wasn't until I was newly married that I finally decided to just let it be.  Over the years I was able to figure out a few things, but there were SO many more things that I had no idea were working against me!  I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who has wavy to curly hair!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
The book was awesome, but my complaint is that there should be videos that go along with it at various points. I am reading on my Kindle Fire, and when I get to the part where the video should be , it says that the video is not supported by the device.  This doesn't make sense, because my kindle fire plays video... I just don't understand what the problem is. Its kind of frustrating. This is the only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5.  I still recommend the book, its great!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
For those of us with Curly Hair... or like me, with a change from straight to curly hair, over the years, this has been so helpful.Life is so much easier when my hair was straight.This is now my hair and I want to make it as easy as possible to do something appealing with it.'

This said it comes with a dvd?  Ours doesn’t seem to have one.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
My middles daughter, with tiny ringlets that had always been frizzy, recommended this to her sisters and me. I think the book, ""Curly Girls"", written by the woman who developed Diva Curl, is very important--you will see your kind of curly hair--with instructions on how to do it. I actually referred back to it often duding the first 6 months I used the stuff. Make sure you use her products--they are fabulous! I can't say enough good things about it--and it took me awhile to feel confident enough to actually not wash my hair with any kind of lathering shampoo. I now go one or two months without doing anything but scrubbing my scalp as if I had shampoo in it and my hair is so much happier. Plus, and this was the hard part for me, I don't rinse out the conditioner at all and, like she says, your hair loves you for it. I get so many compliments on my curls now, and I never did before--unless I straightened it! It's softer than ever before, shiny, and, if I do say so myself, gorgeous. It took me a year to embrace all that she says--too set in my ways I think. If only I had known all this when I was younger...

I love the book,i see it as a big inspiration for curly girls and guys.The download was very quick and the e-book is of great quality.Great job amazon.com! My only problem is that the e-book claims to come with audio and video but on my kindle for pc app,these audios and videos do not work.I would really love to listen to and/or watch the audios and videos.I'm hoping that amazon.com will make improvements to the kindle for pc app to make it possible to view and/or listen to videos and audios.

This book is a very comprehensive guide to styling and caring for curly hair. It helped me to drastically pare down my hair care/styling routine. It contains info on trimming your own hair, which I've tried to a lesser degree but with good results. It also provides a list of stylists trained in this way of cutting and styling curly hair. I hope to make and appointment with one of the stylists in our state soon.

I heard a lot about the ""curly girl method"" via youtube and I wanted a little more background info about it.  This book really helps make sure you do the best that you can do for your hair to keep it healthy.  I read through the whole book just to get knowledge about other curly girls as well so I can give out recommendations.  I do have some friends who also have curly hair and I love that they come to me for advice on products.  I owe it all to this book :)
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This method doesn't work well for my fine curly hair.  Neither do the devacurl hair products the author sells.  After a couple of months of trying everything, I've learned that my hair looks and feels awful if I follow her advice.  It was fun reading though and trying all the tips.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book was written with pasion and telling somebody's truth. Its very well documented and resourceful. It shows the work of a lifetime in a way everyone understands. Life changer and a must for girl like me who never realized thay wavy hair is a recognized type and a beautiful pattern not damaged hair and impossible genetics as industries make you believe. I finished in like two days. Enjoy!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This is an AMAZING resource to get started on your wavy/curly adventure!  I learned soooo much and my waves have improved to curls in a matter of days. Now, to let the experiment begin with the right products and cuts for my curls!This is for women/men and parents of curlies!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
It is a great book with great information. However, the ebook version is not the best format. I would buy a paper book because it comes with a DVD. The ebook (which I read on my phone) could not play the videos, and the puctures were too tiny to see in detail.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I knew having a child with curly hair was going to be a challenge so I picked up this book and it is fabulous! I had no idea there was so much information out there regarding curls. Its also great for the straight haired family members as well. Even though there is tons of curl specific info there is also a great deal of tips on just keeping your hair healthy which anyone can use. Very satisfied with this book!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I really love this book.  The only part I didn't like was the Curl Confession on page  117.  Did she really have to mention the lover?  Who cares?  I sent this book to my young niece because the testimonials in this book make you feel happy to have curly hair; and teach you to take care of it.  I would have loved a book like this when I was young.  My sister-in-law is going to put a sticker over page 117.

My mom needed this book around when I was a kid! Wonderful information that only true curly girls learn on their own ""eventually"". Good info on different curl patterns and what each pattern needs in care and cuts. My daughter hast even tighter curl than I did so it really helped me in seeing the expectations I should have when dealing with her tight curls.

I had never found the right products or method of doing my curly hair.  The Curly Girl Handbook explains step by step how to shampoo, condition, and style each type of different curls you may have whether it is wavy or extra curly.  I ordered the shampoo, conditioner and gel made by Deva Curl and love them.  My hair is so soft and the curls are separated and not frizzy at all.  If you have any type of curly or wavy hair you will love this book! Curly Girl: The Handbook

"

Even if you don't do the Curly Girl method, this book is a must read for naturally curly haired girls.  My now slightly longer curly hair has remained curly after chemotherapy.  I also had curly hair as a kid.  This book gives so many good tips on curly hair... it can be read in an evening and a great reference book to have on hand.  Highly recommended!

"

I'm giving this book to my daughter. I love the pictures of different styles possible with very curly hair. My daughter should benefit from looking at this book and DVD as she finds her beautiful thick curly hair hard to manage. I'm hoping that she'll learn from Curly Girl how to take advantage of her hair, rather than fighting it.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Wish I had ordered the paper version, because the translation to Kindle is poor.  The content is jumbled and incomplete on my Kindle.  (I have the original version).  The videos are not supported by my Kindle, which Amazon did not tell me during my purchase.  As for the content of this book itself -- I haven't tried any of the techniques so who knows.  Just wanted potential buyers to know that the original Kindle version is not worth the money, buy the paper version.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
After watching YouTube videos of other curly girls and guys, I knew I had to check this out.  I read it in one afternoon while simultaneously mixing up some of the homemade concoctions it talked about.  Have since made a high difference in my hair happiness based upon this book.  A great find!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I was skeptical that any product or treatment could change my dry, frizzy waves into soft and manageable curls. I have been following the guidance in this book for over a month and while it takes some getting used to - I can honestly say that my hair is much softer and better behaved than I have ever expected. I've actually gotten compliments on my hair since I've been treating it differently. I'm glad I got this book.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Excellent book with great hair care advice. My coworkers and friends now love my hair and think my curls look like I got them at a salon.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This was very informative and an easy, quick read.  With four girly girls in our family, it was very encouraging to find some support for difficult hair.  It's still taken some trial-and-error to find what works for each of us after reading the book, but I would recommend this if you are interested in taking care of curly hair or using Deva-Curl products.

These methods take more time than just blow drying your hair straight.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Of interest to me is that my hair looked 90% better within just a few days of applying a few of the tips from this book. Even before the hair ends had time to be replaced with healthier strands, my curls were much more defined, and much less frayed looking. I am already receiving frequent complements on my hair and inquiries as to what I am doing different!!
"

I love this book!  It has helped me to learn how to better manage my incredibly coily hair.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering going natural, or who may already be natural and is trying to learn to manage their hair.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Technical Difficulties!I purchased this last week for my Kindle App that I use via my iPad 1. There was no sound to any of the videos. The videos would play but no sound. I recalled someone's review stating that the sound could only be heard on the iPad or iPhone. I thought using the Kindle App on my iPad would be fine, but it is not. I had to order the book from Apple iBooks. All videos played great and had sound. If you don't want to hear the audio on the videos the book worked just fine with the Kindle app.Now the book...I really like this book. I am only 7 weeks post my last relaxer. I am African American. I have been trying to read everything I can about going natural. This book has been well worth my time. I have read many blogs and watched many You Tube videos that have been helpful.  I really wanted a book and this has been the answer for my beginning transition steps. I have read about 2/3 of the book. There are chapters devoted to hair textures that are commonly African American. The author does a great job explaining things. I would recommend this to anyone interested in having healthy curly hair.However, I would say that the book has A LOT of fluff. I would rather just get to the point. That is why I rated it 4 and not 5.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I watched all the videos online and didn't think I needed the book. I also went to my stylist and got a curly girl cut and got additional instruction there.I got the book after my friend recommended it to me and don't regret it. I use it as a reference and continue to ""tweak"" my curly girl process with hints from the book. I even ordered pure lavender oil from Amazon and made my own Mist-er-Right based on the ""recipe"" in the book.

After watching several utube videos, the book was a great reference.  I’m 3 weeks into the CG method and notice a big difference already!

I wish I had this when I was younger. My hair is naturally wavy, but I never knew how to take care of it when I was younger. This book explains how to take care of curly hair. It also describes different types of curly hair & gives instructions how to determine the the type curl you have.

All you need to know to take care of your noodles! It's interesting to know tabt there are different ways to take care of each curl type. It's the perfect handy book for curly girls! Didn't think I would learn the things I did after reading this book!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I love this book!  It has great tips for curly headed girls, boys, men and women!  I love the recepies it has for different hair products.  I make the lavender water spray and use it on days I don't wash my hair.  My hair smells and feels great.  I've been using the curly girl method now for 6 months and there's no going back for me.  My hair looks and feels so much more healthy!  My 5 year old has curly hair too.  We've been using the curly girl method for her too and her hair is so much easier to manage.  Not near as many tangles or tears!  Thanks!

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
What an eye-opener!!!!!!!  All my life I hated my hair!!!!!!!!!  I went through a bleaching process to get blonde hair, and along with that also relaxed my hair in order to have pin straight hair.  I grew up believing curly hair was ugly and something that needed to be changed!  SOCIETY HAS FED US SO MANY LIES!!!  But enough is enough.... I got myself this book when I decided to transition to my all natural curly hair and embrace what GOD has given me!  Ladies, this book is a gem and will guide you into all you need to know about your beautiful curly hair which needs some TLC!  I have been following the curly girl method and seeing drastic changes on my curly hair already!  I work with my natural hair, instead of fighting against it and believe it or not ... I CAN HONESTLY SAY I AM STARTING TO LOVE MY HAIR!!!!!!!!  I'm even getting so many compliments from people.  (=

This book is great if you don't how to style curly hair! It also explains the differences in curl types. Liked the ""home recipes"" it gave for products. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because I was able to find much of this info online without the book. The author's product line website ""DevaCurl"" is another helpful place to check out.

If you, like me, have grown tired of over-processing your hair, and you have any amount of curl, this is the definitive book for you!

My hair is becoming  more naturally curly ( and frizzy :-(  ) with each passing year. This book helped me to not only accept my curls, but taught me how to enhance them so that I actually enjoy them!  It went on sale after I purchased mine so I scooped up several copies to give to friends.

Omg I'm love this book because it gave me some insight about loving your hair an  I like the different tips that was distribute to me about going natural and how some ladies were  battle cancer and had to  cut their hair off....recommend to anyone that is going natural... I would have to say that I'm a modify cg girl cuz some of the strategy don't work for me like one of my favorite blogger mahogany curls.....

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
The best book I have ever found to FINALLY learn how to tame my natural curls!!  SERIOUSLY if you have curly hair this is a MUST HAVE hair bible! My salt & pepper hair has never looked better, more healthy and has never been as curly and shiny in all my life! Techniques in this book are not for SISSY's because you have to commit to the process (I initially thought this process was ludicrous and it would make my hair gross, greasy, limp & lifeless.........yet not only did it NOT do any of that, the process was so effective it has REALLY made all the difference in the world and I LOVE my curly hair finally after 53 years!  TRY IT!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
You have curly or wavy hair? Get this book!  You'll learn how to properly wash, dry & especially trim your hair PROPERLY between hair cuts!! Yes, you'll still want to go to our hairdresser for 'hair cuts' but less frequently!  PS I also recommend you use DEVA hair products for your lovely, curly/wavy hair.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I bought this book because my adorable 8yr old daughter has VERY curly hair(thank you Irish grandma), I do not have curly hair and so it proved difficult to figure out what to do with her hair. Most days it was frizzy and looked like she rolled out of bed and stuck her finger in a light socket. We ALWAYS told her though how lucky she was to have such beautiful curls(thankful we did that after reading this book). This book has brought sanity to my life, no more tears due to uncontrollable tangles and now I know how to do it. It's especially nice to read a book for curly girls that does not advocate for TONS of icky/chemical laden products, I've read plenty of those and just couldn't bring myself to put those types of product on her hair. We have always used organic shampoo/conditioner so it was nice to read this book and know that we were headed down the right path and now with a bit of change to our routine and an addition of a few home made NATURAL products(this book gives amazing recipes) things are going great. My daughter wakes up everyday so excited to have her sprayed with either conditioner or lavender spray. Please consider buying this book as a gift for someone who does not have curly hair but there child does.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I happened upon this book by accident. I embraced and tried its method message with curiosity. My hair for the first time in over 50 years, is happy, healthy, and wild with curly jubilation.  Unknowingly, I began the ""transitional phase"" a couple of years ago. I quit fighting the silvery gray, the poof and frizz, and threw out all things heat related. After becoming a Grandmother, I decided it wasn't so bad to look the part the Blessings of the wee ones had bestowed upon me. No longer interested in the battle of the hair, I knew my time was better spent on the good things Life so graciously offers us. By following the easy methods within this book, my hair has come alive before my eyes. After all these years, we're finally friends. More importantly, we LOVE each other! Who knew?!?!  Four stars on paper...five in my Heart. Why four? Ms. Massey, your book overlooked Curly Elder Woman Hair ~ a HUGE growing segment of the population!!!
"

Good book, although kind of generic when it comes to the steps to take care of hair. Love the detail of the types of curl though. Although maybe with a little more google research, I could've read all the topics in this book.

Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
My sister recommended this book and I downloaded on my Nook which is great for viewing the how-to videos.  Using the Curly Girl technique with No-Poo and One Condition really brought out the curl in my hair.  I'm really enjoying my new curly look.I just bought the paperback version as a reference.  Thanks, Michele Bender!  I went from dry fuzzy hair to beautiful curly hair.

I bought this to replace my 5th paperback of the first version. I kept giving them to my favorite Curly Girls. I have been conditioning my curls with this method for ten years and love all the new info in this book, especially how to trim my own hair, create up-dos, and add to my list of potions. Thank you for this book!

I bought this for my wife who has great natural curly hair.  She used to go to different stylists and specialists for her curly hair and experiment with a lot of products for her hair.She loves this book.  It not only answered questions and offered great advice, it saved her a ton of money.  She's much happier with her hair now and thanks to this book, is able to manage her curls much better.
"

I thought I was pretty beauty savvy and knew a lot about my curly hair before reading this book- but this book taught me so much more. I bought a copy for a friend and if I ever have a curly haired daughter, I will give her this book!

After just one day of following the advice in this book, my curly hair looks the best it has looked in years.  I have had issues with my hair my entire life and cannot believe how much I didn't know about the nature of my own hair.  I have always said that my hair has a mind of its own, but no more!  This book may be the cure for my straight hair envy.  Highly recommended!

I tried the Curly Girl method as soon as I got the book and have seen great improvements in my hair already! Next step is finding a hairdresser for curly hair. The book contains really cute anecdotes that any Curly Girl can relate to! This book was first recommended to me 3 years before I finally bought and I wish I had never waited! I could have saved myself so much time straightening and stress about humidity!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has a lot of stuff in it that you can skip over, particularly if you haven't had much trauma with your curly hair (curly hair confessions and 12 step program is a little much for me). I skimmed through this book and found the stuff I needed to take care of my hair in a couple of hours. Certainly worth the few bucks that I spent on it (Kindle edition).
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I give this book five stars on one hand: the author/stylist calls the beauty-product industry (and our culture) into question for the non-so-subtle insistence that ALL hair should be straight. I LOVED how she points out that stylists are *trained* to straighten hair, something I'd never realized before. No wonder they never seem to know how to cut or style my hair (or understand why I don't want them to flatten it!) I also love the idea that it really could have been harsh chemicals in shampoo that made my hair look like crap all these years.So I started following the advice in the book. And for at least a month, I was planning to get on here and say ""the whole things's a scam!"" But I was still holding out hope, so I broke down and shelled out for the Deva Curl products from this same stylist's line, which are PRICEY, and I will say, I definitely notice my curls looking softer, springier, and more enhanced. I'm still not entirely positive that it isn't just the fact that it's getting more humid where I live. But I do think there has been some improvement in the texture of my curls.My one main complaint (since I still think it's fair to give my hair a few more weeks or even months to this system and see if it keeps adjusting to no-poo) is that the book and the video do NOT come with clear enough ""how-to"" visuals. Particularly with the clipping technique, for example-- the tutorial on the CD shows you a tutorial of how to do it that lasts, oh, two seconds? It makes me think I might be able to find better tutorials for free on YouTube.So, overall, if you can afford this book, get it. If you can't, borrow it from a friend or the library. Or look up curly-hair advice on YouTube, and save your money for the DevaCurl no-poo and conditioner.

I read the first installment as well as the second. I would say if you have read the 1st you really will not get much out of the second. It is mostly the same information. The only difference is this one is more self promoting since the author now has her own product line. I would actually recommend the first book over this second version.

I've found some information about this book on the internet before I've purchased it... I was very curious because my hair is very curly and I always had problems trying to tae care of it, sadly it always looked dry and frizzy... but I've been following the curly girl method for almost 2 months and this is life changing... my hair feels soft and my curls are defined and frizz free, I'm following all the steps and recomendations given on the book and now I'm using only conditioner to clean my scalp and sulfate free cleanser just once a week and I feel so happy now that I wear my hair down every day for work and go out... I use to wear my hair tied back on a very tight ponytail and I was loosing hair so fast that I thought I was going to end up bald... but now my hair is full of life and incredibly soft... I recomend it for all curly girls out thereRegardsKarla

I saw this book in a beauty parlor and couldn't put it down, so I ordered my own copy.  It has tons of tips for any type of hair.  It tells you how to keep your hair in good condition, how to let it be beautiful on it's own without all kinds of glop in it, and much much more.  I haven't finished it yet, but have learned a great deal.  I recommend it to everyone.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book is so informational.  It tells me stuff that I hadn't realized about curly hair.  It gives wonderful ideas on how to take care of your hair type along with step by step instructions ... The key words are NO POO ... I co wash and use no poo ... My hair is healthier and more manageable, and I've only been using this system for a few weeks now. Totally amazing!!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I bought the first edition years ago and was thrilled to finally find someone who understood the complex problems and differences of curly hair.  This updated version comes with a DVD which shows how the processes work and how to do them correctly.  It really help me understand the concepts better and correct some ""interpretation"" issues/mistakes I had.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Most of the information in the book didn’t apply to me. The internet has the same info.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I love this book it is really like my new hair bible.  It has a section to help you identify your curl type, it explains the curly girl method, how to wash your hair and style it (for curlies, wavies and kinkier hair too), homemade recipes, how to trim your own hair, coloring your hair, a kids section, guys sections, Q and A, updos for special occasions, and even a chemo section (among others).It was a really helpful book in explaining how to take better care of your curls and I find myself going back and referring to it often. And trust me for the prize the book is definitely worth it.The thing that I love most about this book is that after I finished reading it I had a new appreciation for my curls.  If you have naturally curly hair don't try to fight it.  The nicer you treat it the nicer it will treat you.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I started using DevaCurl products on my hair and when I searched curly hair this book came up.  I hated my curly hair growing up because nobody knew how to handle it.  This book changed my outlook on having curly hair.  Now, I feel so lucky to have curly hair.  More importantly, the author educates you on care and styling of your hair.  Now, I rock my botticelli curls!  I highly recommend this book.  Changed my entire look!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have naturally curly hair and over the years learned on my own how to manage my hair. My daughter's hair, during late elementary school, started developing all of these wonderful curls. By 7th grade she was extremely frustrated with it. I bought this book and we explored it together (I even learned some things). Needless to say the book was life changing for her. I now have this very confident 10th grader who tries to mentor her other Curly Girl friends (who won't listen by the way). Can't recommend this book enough. Even found a salon nearby that sells the hair care products. Fantastic!

"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Totally changed the way I looked at hair care, and the health and behavior of my hair. Love it. Some of the ideas are a little extreme, but going shampoo free and giving up traditional hair ties had made all the difference for my hair. My hair stylist noticed a difference in just a few weeks.
"

Great book for anyone with curls or waves. A wonderful way to move away from silicones and sulfates and get your hair and scalp healthy.

I kept checking this out at the library and finally decided that I needed my own copy.  This is a great handbook for anyone interested in making peace with curly hair.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Being 40 years old, I have: put up with, hated, charged revolt against  (flattened, straightened, cut short) my naturally curly hair.  This taught me how to care for it (to keep the curls as they are) and now, after 40 years, I can finally embrace my curls and not fight them.  This book was recommended to me by a hairdresser with naturally curly hair herself.  Thank you!

It was a great book to read about how to take care of curly hair and I still refer back to it from time to time.  Enjoyed reading the stories about people who decided to stop straightening their hair and why.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book was groundbreaking at its firs edition, introducing a whole new technique to manage curly hair. However, it is now outdated. There are much better resources for free online, with more technical detail, without an own brand that they are trying to sell... not worth your dollars!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
great for beginners or people transitioning to natural, but doesn't give me new information that i couldn't find out on youtube. it does have a lot of info for people who are not sure how to take care of there hair.
"

Great book to understand curly hair.  I love the illustrations and the authors sense of humor.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Lots of great information and help.  Been doing this for about 5 weeks and have been ever so close to reach for the hair dryer.  Instead, I reached for the Curly Girl book and found inspiration to stick with it.  And I am seeing results!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I liked all of the pictures and explanations, step-by-step methods. The ideas presented were not too crazy, or super complicated. My whole family (curly and straight alike) has been using no shampoo for about 2 months now...and our hair is amazing. Our 2 girls (4&5 yrs) used to have a ball of frizz by the end of the day no matter how much conditioner we put in it, but after following the curly girl guidelines, their hair looks a lot like the picture on the front cover. ALSO my girls can now wash their own hair since there is no shampoo. They love how easy it is to take care of & style. No dislikesRecommend product to anybody with hair, and especially those with kids. Look at pictures of your great great grandmother. Look at her hair when shampoo had not been invented yet.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This was recommended to me by my sister who has thick curly hair.  I was skeptical that it wouldn' t work for my very fine, very frizzy hair. The methods have changed my relationship with my hair.  It is easier to manage, looks better with out the frizz and I am happier with it than I ever have been in my life.  Wish I had started doing this years ago.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I am a curly girl of color, however it appears that this book was written more towards those who are Caucasian. The book was easy to read, and had a positive flow. If anything, it is reassuring to those who have negative feelings about the hair they were born with.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Doesn’t show many things for my type of hair. :/ it will work better for my sister she has natural Shirley temple hair. So this might work better for her.

My beautician told me about this book for curly hair and how to tame and love your curls. It's great it gives you wonderful tips on putting moisture back in your curls. Tips on stop using shampoo which damages curly hair and learning how to use condition as a wash instead of shampoo. I have seen the difference in by curls and would recommend this book for all types of curly hair.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
A great book!  Very helpful method. I receive many compliments on my hair. I learned so much. Wish I had this method when I was growing up.
"

I love this book. I was following some of the techniques but not all from friends, but I'm so glad I purchased. I give this book 4 stars because the Amazon kindle version did not play the videos.

Amazing book! Anybody with curly hair should buy it!
"

This book changed my life.  I love that I am now treating my hair according to it's characteristics rather than like every other head of hair in the world.  READ IT.  It will change you hatred of your hair.  I did find some of the testimonials a little over-dramatic.  But, the tips were well worth any chessiness the book contains.

BEST BOOK EVER for Curly Hair girls!!! I have always struggled with how to wear my hair with curls and not deal with frizz. As a 50 year old, I now have the tools I need to be confident with wearing my hair as it was created to be=CURLY! Excellent book for anyone with curly hair. I especially love the new section on chemo curls and curls for guys.

Every girl with any sort of texture to their hair should read this. It is so uplifting and empowering reading stories about others with similar hair trials and tribulations. The techniques and resources provided in this make the Curly Girl Method seem so easy!

I straightened my hair with a blow dryer for my entire life because no one in my family has curly hair and I never knew how to take care of it.  Now I have gorgeous curls because I followed the information in this book.  I save so much time not blow drying and get compliments on my hair all the time... wish I'd found this years ago!!

Entertaining and informative book for women with all types of curly hair.  Even has life anecdotes that entertain. Have read and re read now and learned much from these ladies.  If you have curly hair and want to learn ways to enhance, not just cope... a must have... even if you do not follow the no poo method she made famous the book with teach you volumes.... from washing to styling to trimming at home..... have fun!

I bought it thinking on my niece, witch lovely curls  were always messed.We have seen the DVD and next day she looked like an angel.O livro é sensacional !Bem explicado, detalhado e com diversas receitas caseiras. Olhando as fotos pode-se ter também boas sugestões de cortes de cabelos. E os homens não são esquecidos.Só não sei onde encontrar os produtos sem alcool, sem silicone.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has made a big difference in my hair!  The only complaint I have is that it is a bit too militant about what is and is not acceptable to do with curly hair.
"

The description says this book comes with a dvd.  I ordered 2 books.  Neither came with a dvd.  I'm returning both.  Will try again.

iT DID NOT SHOW ME STEP BY STEP HOW TO DO MY HAIR. i WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK AND THE DISC THAT WAS INCLUDED WITH IT.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have naturally curly hair and don't see hair books in the store made specifically for curly hair.  This book was very helpful for me.  I was one of the ones that fought the curl and blew dried and straightened my hair since High School.  I am now in my 50's and my stylist keeps telling me to quit going against my hair and go with it.  I purchased Curly Girl book and read it.  I am working with my curly hair now and wearing it naturally.  The Curly Girl book has a lot of helpful suggestions from washing to hair cutting.  If you are a curly girl and still fight with your curls, I recommend you purchase this book.  It is great!!!!
"

I recently tried a new hair stylist who let me borrow her copy of this book, when i returned hers i knew i needed a copy of this for myself. I have incredibly curly hair and really enjoyed reading Michele's story as well as her tips for handling curly hair.

"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I wish I knew about this a long time ago.  I have naturally wavy hair, but always ""blow-fried"" it because if I let it dry naturally,  it would be frizzy. Even with using high-end hair products over 30yrs., in humid weather, my hair still got frizzy. When I was a young child in the 70's, I have memories of my mom torturing me while combing my hair using No More Tangles.  I have health issues that interfere with me being able to care for my appearance the way I prefer to at times & this past summer, I started letting my hair dry naturally at times. I ended up having to do extra styling so it defeated the purpose, but I started getting a lot of compliments on my ""new"" wavy hair. So, at age 45, I decided I will start going au naturel, but I wanted to do it the right way and started researching the best way to care for my hair to avoid the frizzies.  I came upon this book and the Deva Curl products and decided it would be the best place to start.What I like:- This book is very easy to read and understand (I read it in one night)- DVD is included- Describes various types of curly hair and best way to care for each of them.- has a chapter on treatments you can make from simple, natural ingredients to use on your hair.-Gives step-by step instructions on how to create various styles-Has a chapter for men-Has a chapter for Ethnic hair-Has a chapter on how to care for children's curly hair & how to make them feel good about-Has anecdotal stories from people about their trials growing up because others made them feel that curly hair was not good to have(fortunately I never went through that!) & how they finally came to embrace their curly hair.-Tells you how to find a good stylist-Gives info on the best way to highlight & color your hair-Gives directions on how to trim your own hair-Describes products you should and should not use on your hair and whyCon:-this book advises to completely commit to your curly hair by throwing away your heat styling instruments and brushes, and never straightening your hair again. To me, that is a bit extreme because I like to go between the two looks. However, I do agree that to have healthiest looking curls/waves, you probably should get rid of your heat styling products and brushes.I had no clue about most of the information in this book.  I bought the products I need, and items they suggested and am looking forward toseeing how my curls will start to transform.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This is a must-read for anyone with curly hair.  I spent so much time straightening my hair for years.  This book taught me how to properly care for and style my hair.  I'm able to wear my hair curly all the time now and it is very healthy.  I gave it to other friends with curly hair and they are super impressed also.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
if you have curly hair, you need to read this book. It will change your world. not that you need to use all the products from Deva Curl, but the knowledge and the processes will work for you if you just have faith and follow along. It's so nice that someone figured this all out for us.

I am a recent diva, and have found this book to be invaluable and I still refer back to it. I won't even bother to put it on the book shelf, so it's always by my bed.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I learned some interesting things about my hair type and how to maintain it. Some of the pages were not as interesting.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book is a must for any curly girl. I previously read and followed the method 2 years ago. My hair grew vibrantly and healthy. I went from having no curls to a head full of curls!!!! I would wash my hair 2-3x a week. My scalp issues went away and my hair was super curly. I have even deviated from the routine for a year but my curls have remained. I am an African American female with type 4 hair! It takes 2-3 months but once the curls come they stay!!!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This is a great book.  I purchased this book about 12 years ago and loved it.  I must have loaned it out to someone that never gave it back so I purchased the digital version for my Kindle app on my Android.  This updated version has great additional info that I sure don't remember from before.I have wavy hair and I needed some reminders on how to care for it and I got it in the book.  I have loved my curls ever since I bought the book 12 years ago, I have never looked back.My disappointment lies with the fact that my device can not handle the videos that are included and although I knew that when I bought it, I think a price break would be appropriate.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Bought the Kindle edition which was supposed to have videos.  The videos don't work.  As for the book, it has excellent advise for curlies  I would have given it more stars if the videos would have worked.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Very helpful. I never thought I would figure out how to handle my curls (seriously), but this book has provided insight as well as stories of others who have gone through the trials and tribulations of naturally curly hair. Great book and an easy read.

Love, love, love this book.  If you have a curly hair, this is a must read.

Gave this book to my 11 year old daughter for Christmas to find out it has some inappropriate language and basically says you need to get your curls under control to flirt and...other stuff. Just needed a book that talked about hair.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
So amazing. My curly hair has never looked better. I cannot believe what a difference it has made to follow the guidelines in this book. I bought the hard copy so I could use it as a reference book, and it has already proved it's worth.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Although ""curly girls"" know much more now than we used to, this book is still full of really useful information. This book has also been the encouragement I needed to let go of certain habits and finally cut my heat damaged ends. I would recommend it to any and all ppl struggling with or wanting to learn more about their curly hair!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I love love love this book.  I only wish it had come out a long time ago.  I have struggled with my hair as long as I can remember.  Now with the help from this book I know how to manage my curly hair.  I love my hair now and I get compliments all the time.  I was skeptical but I promise you that these methods work.  Say goodbye to your hair straightener, your lengthy hair routine and all your anti-frizz products!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Method didn’t work for us.  Wasted $$
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have curly hair, and like most curlies have had it all my life and for the past year and a half I've really put a lot of effort into learning about taking proper care of my hair since I decided to stop straightening it.  I expected to learn more from this book since I had heard great reviews however I didn't learn any more than I had already learned for free online.  Additionally, the video component of the e-version did not work because I own a kindle and it only works for iPads.  I think there should have been a reduced price for kindle users or it should have been made much clearer that the video would not work on a kindle.  (If it weren't for that issue I would give it 3 stars)
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book was very helpful in teaching me how to care for my hair and my daughter's as well. I never thought about how many different types of curls there are and how they need to be cared for differently. I would recommend this to anyone with curly or wavy hair that struggles with styling it naturally.

So much good information for curly girls! I wish my mom had this book 34 years ago when my little toddler head sprouted wild unruly ringlets, or even when I was 13 and I thought braiding my hair every day for the next 5 years would make it straight.  It didn't, by the way.  This book will help you or a curly girl you know Embrace The Curl!
"

I refer back to this book every year on my natural hair journey.  When I'm feeling like a mixologist I look up recipes to whip up in the kitchen to help nourish my kinky, coily, hair.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I loved reading this book. It not only explained how to care for my curly hair but gave explanation to what the products and routines used before has done to my hair. This book also was very comforting to read how many people have felt the same way about their curls as I did. The education and support provided to care for curly hair will definitely change how I view my curls and self.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book is full of helpful instructions and testimonials for any women (and guys) who has naturally curly hair. It is very detailed and not only reviews how to take care of curly hair but to embrace it and love it. The author is knowledgable and speaks from first hand experience and years of research and development. Her writining style and humor helps move forward through the book during the step by step parts that can often be dry.(There is a DVD too that is helpful which shows how to wash, dry, manage, and treat different types of curly hair) It is easy to read and follow and is a must read for anyone with curly hair. Quit fighting it and embrace your curls!! You will be glad you did.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This was an okay book but I wouldn't recommend it for the Kindle.  Reason being, there are videos I could not watch because it said my device did not have the ability to do that.  Also, some of the stuff recommended I personally didn't find to be true.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
As a curly hair girl I would have loved to have this information years ago. Since I bought and began trying some of the suggestions my hair actually looks and feels healthier. This book is worth buying...I bought my family/friends some for Christmas gifts because I wanted to share the information. They are glad I did :-). I could not believe the transformation of my hair in a few short weeks.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Very helpful guide. I have made many of the homemade hair gels and sprays - which saves money. The descriptions with pictures really help get the point across of how different caring for curly hair is.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I love this book!! It has great tips, recipes, tales of other curly girls and what they have went through and their ah ha moments to deal with all things curly. My hair dresser recommended this book to me and since I have received it I have read it multiple times and shared it with other curly girlfriends. Thanks for a great book can't wait got the next one to come out.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Fought my curls until two years ago when my daughter suggested I attend a Curly Girl seminar at a salon specializing in curly hair. Haven't used a dryer or iron since. The book gives lots of new info. The recipe for lavender mist alone is worth the price of the book.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Inspiring. A friend introduced me to the concept of just letting my hair be and recommended this book and products. They're wonderfully liberating.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Since I started using the Curly Girl method, people I know have commented how good my hair is looking. OK, it's not as perfect as the cover photo, but WAY less fuzzy than it's ever been. I ended up giving the book to my niece, since she's a hair stylist, and she loves it too.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book has changed my curls! I love them even more now!Every Curl confession was like reading about myself and my feelings...Great book- simple to the point... but sometimes too simple- The section about styling hairs (up do's etc) went over my head a little... but haven't actually tried them yet- Wish there was a step by step illustration with each guiding point... But that such a small thing in comparison to what this book is doing for me! Thank you Lorraine Massey! Wish you could pass your knowledge to every salon in India (Mumbai) as no one knows how to handle curly hair and strangely enough there are so many curly/wavy beauties out here!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have two curly girls and both have very different types.  This book was helpful because it covers a wide range of different curls and gives information on care for all types. She is not as specific as I would have liked and I didn't know which products would work well or not.  Perhaps because she has her own line of products she didn't want to mention anything specific. It was helpful regarding cutting of curly hair.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
Life changing for your curls! This is the bible or at least the best solid groundwork for learning how to take the best care of your curly hair (really any hair) and get the best looking curls possible!

This book has completely changed my hair care routine and for the better. I now love my hair and never have a bad hair day. It's incredible what a difference this book can make. It's a lot of fun to read all the stories too in addition to leanring all the techniques.
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
This book delivers everything you need to know about handling curly hair with care.  I appreciate the fact that the book is picture heavy where needed and not too wordy.  The accompanying DVD is great as well.  I would say this is a must have for curly girls, and anyone who will be caring for a head of curly hair.  If only my mother would have had this book when I was a kid!  LOL!

For the first time in as long as I can remember I love my hair!  This book has great tips.  I have tried several of the home recipes, and have like every one so far.  If you have curly hair and have struggled with it for year, you really need to read this book.  I keep it handy all the time so I can refer back when needed.  I'm thinking about getting the kindle version too, just so I am never without it!!!

"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
i have curly hair (obviously) so when i searched for ways to go natural after i finally decided to give up on the 7+ years of hair abuse i came across this book that i have never ever heard about as i never paid attention to my hair since my only solution then was straighten it. Now so so soooo glad i found it, learned so much from it and most definitely recommend it!!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I have struggled with my curls for the past 27 years. I had so much frizz that the kids used to call me the lion in reference to a fluffy main. All of my family has straight hair, and so had no idea how to help me with the poof. So, my choices were to brush them out (ow) and put them in a clip or ponytail, or try my luck at straightening them, (which never works). This book gave me simple methods, with videos and recipes, to make my curls shiny and lovely. After the first day of following Curly Girl instructions, the damaged curls I have were no longer frizzy, but quite pretty. Now that I have been following the guidelines for a few weeks, I can see that my hair is growing faster, (about an inch in 3 weeks, which is multiples faster than usual), and the hair coming in is stronger, while the curls are tighter and more uniform. I am excited to see what my hair really looks like, once it grows out longer, if I stick to the program. Thanks, Curly Girl, for showing me how to love my hair!
"
Curly Girl: The Handbook,"
I've fought with my curls my entire life; but after reading this book I decided to embrace them (if you can't beat 'em, join 'em -- right?). I started following the regimen laid out in this book and I now get stopped in stores and on the street by people asking me if my curls are natural and how gorgeous my hair is. Thanks Ms. Massey! So glad I bought this book!
"

I wish I had this book growing up.  I used to hate my curls and always kept my hair super-short so that I didn't have to deal with them.Just the other day, I got a haircut and it's pretty short yet I can still work with my curls and let them curl the way they want to, or I can use gel to spike them up.

If your a man don't hesitate to get this book. After all we probably know less about hair and beauty than women. My hair is already looking more healthy. Recommended by my stylist who is associated with Devacurl

I have botticelli curls. I have always struggled with taming my hair and this book taught me how to love my curls and use them to my advantage. I follow almost all of the 'rules' and have noticed a significant difference in my hair. Don't be afraid to stop using conditioner. Your hair will thank you for it!

Could do without the cheesy self-love silliness. The practical tips are useful. Would appreciate more info for men.

I've already adopted many of her recommendations and am really impressed with how my hair looks and feels.  I was getting compliments the very first day!I am definitely letting all my ""Curly Girl""-friends and relatives know about this book.  It is past time to embrace our hair as something special and wonderful.

About 20 years ago I started thinking about going natural.  As an African-American woman that was a big deal at the time but I was sick of all the mess, hassle, stress and expense of relaxing my hair and keeping it up.  So I started using a texturizer thinking it was a bit better.  Then I read the first version of this book... and it changed my hair forever.  I stopped shampooing and started no-pooing.  I went through conditioner like crazy but it started working.  My curls started coming together and everyone started asking what kind of perm rods I was using to get my curls so defined.  I just smiled and said ""None, these are all mine"".  I must have leant that book out to a quarter of my relatives before I got it back.  I lost most of my books in a move a few years back and I was so upset that I lost that book.  If you are curly, a coil-y, a kinky or nappy, if you have waves that won't behave, or if you know someone who is you must get this book.  The update is amazing, especially the parts for the curly guys and for people whose hair texture has changed.

Finally...all the do's and do not's, suggestions, and helpful hints for curly hair, all in one place. I have fought my curly hair for decades because I never knew how to manage it and control the frizz and none of my hair dressers EVER knew how to really deal with curly hair. EVERY SINGLE ONE of them ALWAYS treated curly hair completely opposite of what is taught in this book. No wonder why my hair ALWAYS looked so bad when I ever tried to go naturally curly. Why they don't teach this in beauty school is beyond me! Maybe curly hair people wouldn't fight their curly hair so much if they had this information. Now I finally have the knowledge to manage and finally actually like my curly hair! This should be  in every curly hair girl's home...especially parents of curly hair kids!So valuable!

This is a MUST if you have curly or wavy hair. I never thought a beauty book could change my life but this one did! It gave me very simple directions on how to manage my curly hair and it has never looked better. I have spent SO much money over the years at ""top"" hair salons and on top products and my hair was still unmanageable frizzy and something I hated. I can't believe how simple Lorraine Massey's tips and techniques are. I get compliments all the time. I wish i had had this book earlier in life - it would have saved me many many bad hair days and my self-esteem since we all know that beauty is more than skin deep. I am buying copies of this book for every curly haired friend and relative!!!! it is truly life changing.

Gives step by step instructions for getting the most out of all types of curly hair--which products to use, how much, how to apply--invaluable if you have curly hair that doesn't always behave the way you want it to.

I was at a crossroads with my hair. Almost to the point of chopping it all off.Curly Girl taught me how to take care of it, nourish it and help it become healthy again. My hair has never looked more beautiful or healthy. Never has it been this easy to take care of.

This is the book you need if you want to learn how to bring out your curl. Every hair type needs a different method, which is thoroughly explained in this book. After thinking I had straight hair for 55 years, I now have bouncy curls and I love it. You might want to add one of the Deva Curl Gels to your shopping cart too. They are the best gels I have tried so far (compared to many other gels). Choose the light defining gel if you don't require too much hold, and the ultra defining gel if you need as much hold as you can get.

I especially like the hair style of the woman on the cover, and I went yesterday to my hair stylist and had my own curls cut in that manner. Although my hair is white, the style works well on me.The book was informative and inspired me to let my hair curl freely and provided valuable tips on bringing out the best in curly hair. I wished they might have shown more ""short"" rather than ""long"" styles.. In most cases, I did not find the long hair styles to be flattering to the wearer.

I never knew I had wavy or swavy hair until one of my friends introduced me to this book.  I LOVE my hair now.  I always wished that I had the beach look hair and always thought that my hair was straight until I read this book.  Now I have beach wave hair without having to go to the beach!  I love this book.

I had heard about the Curly Girl method from my sister who tried to explain it the best she could. After calling her multiple times with questions, she told me that I just need to get the book. I did. It is very informative, and I loved all the specific information I got for my hair type. I loved the DVD that is included, since I am a very visual learner. I was able to watch how washing, conditioning, and styling was actually supposed to be done. I love this book, and so does my hair.

Love the book, easy and great explanations for wavy, curly and coily hair.

This book was eye opening for me. I never paid attention to how my hairstyle made me feel, I felt I could do without the image confusion. If it didn't bother me, then why did I feel so much better when I got the hairstyle right? So I have come to the conclusion that my hair matters.

I love the Curly Girl Handbook.  I've read it cover to cover!  I found out I have ""Cherub"" curls and the book goes step by step on how to wash and style my hair to have the best curls possible.  My curls are beginning to look lie the model's hair on the front cover.  The book is an easy read and I already ordered another for a curly coworker.

Love the support for natural styled curly hair. Great color plates and tips but style looked a little dated

If you have curly hair - this is for you.  I am in my 60's and have lived most of my life fighting my curly hair, suffering bad haircuts, and daily frizz.  The author lays out a plan of action for celebrating the beautiful curls we were born with.  I have been applying her suggestions and the results are awesome.  Less time, less money spent on my hair and way better results.  My curly locks are glorious and the compliments just keep coming!
